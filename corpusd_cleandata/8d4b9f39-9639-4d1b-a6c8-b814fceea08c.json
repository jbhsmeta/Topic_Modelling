    "text": "WHY DID YOU MAKE THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY A CAREER CHOICE?\n\nThe plastics industry encompasses all the areas of manufacturing which\ninterested me in my early college days. For example, to mold a plastic part,\none needs to understand everything from the polymeric selection process\n(including additives and composites) to the steel choice for the injection\nmold. Further, an engineer is required to design the mold tooling and\nintegrate mold actions and secondary operations such as robotics.\n\nIn my current role, I have the opportunity to design components, select\nmaterials, perform CAD of molds and setup processing conditions at the press.\nI enjoy the variety!\n\nWHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE AN SPE MEMBER AS A YOUNG PROFESSIONAL?\n\nThe main reason I find SPE membership useful is the incredible network it\nprovides. The folks I've met through ANTEC[R] and other conference-related\nactivities have been invaluable in my career progression since my\nundergraduate days. The SPE journals and conference proceedings have also been\na source of knowledge and education.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SPE MEMORY?\n\nI really enjoyed ANTEC[R] 2011 in Boston. It was the first professional\nconference that I attended, and I was really impressed with the overall\ncontent. I was able to present a poster on the work I performed at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Stout, which I believe was well received. The\ninteractions I had with the professionals at that point reinforced the fact\nthat I made the right decision in my field of study.\n\nWHAT ONE THING DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT YOU?\n\nOn March 9, 2020, my wife and I welcomed our first child into our family!\nPerhaps a future SPE member--time will tell.\n\nWHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PLASTICS PRODUCT?\n\nTough question. I'm not sure I have an answer. I believe that plastics parts\nhelp to enable excellent product designs and capabilities. Consumer-grade\npower tools are a great example--without plastics components, I'm sure\nconstruction and fabrication would be much more difficult and expensive.\n\nWHAT'S THE BEST ADVICE YOU COULD GIVE SOMEONE NEW TO THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY?\nTour as many plastics-related facilities as you can; typically businesses are\nexcited to show interested potential colleagues around. There is a massive\nvariety of plastics processing equipment in the industry and you should try to\nlearn about all types. Often, in a multicomponent product assembly, the best\nmanufacturing path requires numerous operations. I found that the best way to\nlearn about something is to shadow someone with significant experience.\n\nWHAT'S COOL ABOUT YOUR JOB?\n\nFirst, the people. 3M has a large pool of highly intelligent, innovative\nfolks, who come up with some wild ideas. Being in the corporate labs, I have\nthe pleasure of trying to figure out how to reduce ideas to tangible products.\n\nSecond, the variety. 3M has a diverse product portfolio spanning nearly all\nindustries. I get to work on something new almost weekly, ranging from\nconsumer products to automotive and acoustics, and other products.\n\nThird, the worldwide impact. 3M's products, such as those in personal safety\nand medical solutions, are available around the globe, in every market. Items\nlike the N95 respirators, Avagard antiseptic, and Curos IV port disinfectors\nare currently being leveraged by medical professionals and consumers to combat\nthe COVID-19 virus. Each of these is available thanks to some form of plastics\nmolding technology.",

    "html": "<p>WHY DID YOU MAKE THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY A CAREER CHOICE?</p>\n\n<p>The plastics industry encompasses all the areas of manufacturing\nwhich interested me in my early college days. For example, to mold a\nplastic part, one needs to understand everything from the polymeric\nselection process (including additives and composites) to the steel\nchoice for the injection mold. Further, an engineer is required to\ndesign the mold tooling and integrate mold actions and secondary\noperations such as robotics.</p>\n\n<p>In my current role, I have the opportunity to design components,\nselect materials, perform CAD of molds and setup processing conditions\nat the press. I enjoy the variety!</p>\n\n<p>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE AN SPE MEMBER AS A YOUNG PROFESSIONAL?</p>\n\n<p>The main reason I find SPE membership useful is the incredible\nnetwork it provides. The folks I've met through ANTEC[R] and other\nconference-related activities have been invaluable in my career\nprogression since my undergraduate days. The SPE journals and conference\nproceedings have also been a source of knowledge and education.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE <person>SPE MEMORY</person>?</p>\n\n<p>I really enjoyed ANTEC[R] 2011 in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\">Boston</location>. It was the first\nprofessional conference that I attended, and I was really impressed with\nthe overall content. I was able to present a poster on the work I\nperformed at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2819172261\">University of Wisconsin, Stout</org>, which I believe was\nwell received. The interactions I had with the professionals at that\npoint reinforced the fact that I made the right decision in my field of\nstudy.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT ONE THING DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT YOU?</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>March 9, 2020</chron>, my wife and I welcomed our first child into our\nfamily! Perhaps a future SPE member--time will tell.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PLASTICS PRODUCT?</p>\n\n<p>Tough question. I'm not sure I have an answer. I believe that\nplastics parts help to enable excellent product designs and\ncapabilities. Consumer-grade power tools are a great example--without\nplastics components, I'm sure construction and fabrication would be\nmuch more difficult and expensive.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT'S THE BEST ADVICE YOU COULD GIVE SOMEONE NEW TO THE\nPLASTICS INDUSTRY? Tour as many plastics-related facilities as you can;\ntypically businesses are excited to show interested potential colleagues\naround. There is a massive variety of plastics processing equipment in\nthe industry and you should try to learn about all types. Often, in a\nmulticomponent product assembly, the best manufacturing path requires\nnumerous operations. I found that the best way to learn about something\nis to shadow someone with significant experience.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT'S COOL ABOUT YOUR JOB?</p>\n\n<p>First, the people. 3M has a large pool of highly intelligent,\ninnovative folks, who come up with some wild ideas. Being in the\ncorporate labs, I have the pleasure of trying to figure out how to\nreduce ideas to tangible products.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the variety. 3M has a diverse product portfolio spanning\nnearly all industries. I get to work on something new almost weekly,\nranging from consumer products to automotive and acoustics, and other\nproducts.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the worldwide impact. 3M's products, such as those in\npersonal safety and medical solutions, are available around the globe,\nin every market. Items like the N95 respirators, Avagard antiseptic, and\nCuros IV port disinfectors are currently being leveraged by medical\nprofessionals and consumers to combat the COVID-19 virus. Each of these\nis available thanks to some form of plastics molding technology.</p>",
