    "text": "In his final game before the NBA shut down, Zion Williamson scored 23 points,\nmade 9 of 15 shots, dunked six times and grabbed seven rebounds.\n\nFor most rookies, it would've been an exceptional outing. For the Pelicans'\n19-year-old power forward, it was a run-of-the-mill performance.\n\nIn 19 games, Williamson scored 20 or more points and shot 50% or better from\nthe field 14 times -- the third-most times among all rookies. Ja Morant, who\ndid it 17 times, and Kendrick Nunn, who accomplished it 15 times, were only\nahead of Williamson in that category because they played 40 and 43 more games,\nrespectively.\n\nWilliamson was rolling when the league was forced to suspend play indefinitely\nin mid-March. Can he pick up where he left off? Or will it take him time to\nrediscover that rhythm? From a Pelicans perspective, those are among the most\nsignificant questions as the NBA heads to a vote Thursday to finalize a plan\nto resume the season.\n\nThe NBA is expected to ask 22 teams to finish the season at ESPN's Wide World\nof Sports Complex near Orlando, Florida. Under this \"playoffs plus\" model, the\ntop eight teams in each conference along with Portland, New Orleans,\nSacramento, San Antonio, Phoenix and Washington will be invited. There will\nreportedly be eight regular-season games and a play-in tournament between the\neighth and ninth seeds to finalize the postseason picture.\n\nWilliamson missed the first three months of the season recovering from a knee\ninjury, got 1 1/2 months of games under his belt and then, like most NBA\nplayers, has been confined to his home for the past three months. How will he\nreacclimate to the grind\n\nprofessional basketball after so much time off? The Pelicans will be\nmonitoring closely.\n\nHere are four other big-picture questions as the NBA prepares to ramp back up.\n\nHow will the race for the eighth seed be determined?\n\nPrivately, the Pelicans liked their chances of nabbing the Western\nConference's final playoff spot before the season shut down. They were finally\nhealthy and had one of the easiest closing stretches in the NBA, with 15 of\ntheir final 18 games against teams with losing records. They were confident\nthey could close the 3 1/2 -game gap between them and the Grizzlies, who were\nbanged up and had a difficult closing stretch.\n\nHere's how the race for the eighth seed works now: After eight regular-season\ngames, the NBA will hold a play-in tournament between the teams in eighth and\nninth in each conference, but only if the team in ninth is within four games\nof the team in eighth. The team in ninth must then beat the team in eighth\ntwice in a row.\n\nHypothetically, let's say the Pelicans hold off the Trail Blazers, Kings and\nSpurs for the ninth seed. (No small task.) They go 6-2 in their remaining\nregular-season games and are 2 1/2 games back of the Grizzlies, who remain\neighth. They must beat the Grizzlies twice in a row to advance. If they win\nthe first game of the play-in tournament but lose the second, they are done.\nThe Grizzlies would only have to win one game of that two-game set.\n\nWhy 22 teams instead of 16?\n\nThe cleanest pathway to finishing the season is going straight to the\nplayoffs. Each NBA team is expected to travel to Florida with 35 people.\nConcluding the season with 16 teams instead of 22 teams would mean 210 fewer\nbodies on campus. That seems significant if the NBA wants to do everything it\ncan to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhy mess with regular-season games? A play-in tournament? Six more teams than\nabsolutely necessary? The answer is simple: money.\n\n\"The revenue, I'm told, from just having the 16 and going to the playoffs\nversus 22 and having the play-in and regular-season games (is) several hundred\nmillions more to teams,\" ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said on SportsCenter. \"And\nthat is absolutely a factor in this.\"\n\nThe NBA is trying to do whatever it can to soften the financial blow the\ncoronavirus has administered.\n\nWhen will the season conclude?\n\nThe NBA season could run well into football season. On Tuesday, ESPN reported\nGame 7 of the Finals would take place Oct. 12, the same date the Saints are\nsupposed to face the Chargers on Monday Night Football. Finishing the\nabbreviated regular season and playoffs will take a minimum of two months.\n\nThe start of the 2020-21 season will be pushed back until December at the\nearliest, which means that next year's playoffs won't begin until July. Start\nmentally preparing now for the NBA's most important games to take place during\nthe dog days of summer.\n\nWhere do teams go from here?\n\nThe next step is for teams to recall players to their home markets so they can\nbegin practicing. Right now, practice facilities are only open for voluntary\nindividual workouts. No more than four players are allowed inside at one time.\nAt the Pelicans' practice facility in Metairie, only two baskets are available\nfor players to shoot on.\n\nTeams will effectively have to hold a second training camp to get players back\ninto basketball shape. In April, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry estimated that\ncould take \"20 to 30 days.\"\n\nLast month, executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin\nsaid a little more than half of the Pelicans' players were in the New Orleans\narea. In the coming weeks, expect players who were quarantining outside of\nmarket to trickle back to Louisiana so the Pelicans can restart the process of\ntrying to fight for a playoff spot.",

    "html": "<p>In his final game before the NBA shut down, <person>Zion Williamson</person> scored 23 points, made 9 of 15 shots, dunked six times and grabbed seven rebounds.</p>\n<p>For most rookies, it would've been an exceptional outing. For the Pelicans' 19-year-old power forward, it was a run-of-the-mill performance.</p>\n\n<p>In 19 games, Williamson scored 20 or more points and shot 50% or better from the field 14 times -- the third-most times among all rookies. <person>Ja Morant</person>, who did it 17 times, and <person>Kendrick Nunn</person>, who accomplished it 15 times, were only ahead of Williamson in that category because they played 40 and 43 more games, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Williamson was rolling when the league was forced to suspend play indefinitely in mid-March. Can he pick up where he left off? Or will it take him time to rediscover that rhythm? From a Pelicans perspective, those are among the most significant questions as the NBA heads to a vote Thursday to finalize a plan to resume the season.</p>\n\n<p>The NBA is expected to ask 22 teams to finish the season at <org>ESPN's</org> Wide World <location>of Sports Complex</location> near <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando, Florida</location>. Under this \"playoffs plus\" model, the top eight teams in each conference along with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.portld\">Portland</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sacmto\">Sacramento</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.sanant\">San Antonio</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.az.phonix\">Phoenix</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington</location> will be invited. There will reportedly be eight regular-season games and a play-in tournament between the eighth and ninth seeds to finalize the postseason picture.</p>\n\n<p>Williamson missed the first three months of the season recovering from a knee injury, got 1 1/2  months of games under his belt and then, like most NBA players, has been confined to his home for the past three months. How will he reacclimate to the grind</p>\n\n<p>professional basketball after so much time off? The Pelicans will be monitoring closely.</p>\n\n<p>Here are four other big-picture questions as the NBA prepares to ramp back up.</p>\n\n<p>How will the race for the eighth seed be determined?</p>\n\n<p>Privately, the Pelicans liked their chances of nabbing the <org>Western Conference's</org> final playoff spot before the season shut down. They were finally healthy and had one of the easiest closing stretches in the NBA, with 15 of their final 18 games against teams with losing records. They were confident they could close the 3 1/2 -game gap between them and the Grizzlies, who were banged up and had a difficult closing stretch.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how the race for the eighth seed works now: After eight regular-season games, the NBA will hold a play-in tournament between the teams in eighth and ninth in each conference, but only if the team in ninth is within four games of the team in eighth. The team in ninth must then beat the team in eighth twice in a row.</p>\n\n<p>Hypothetically, let's say the Pelicans hold off the Trail Blazers, Kings and Spurs for the ninth seed. (No small task.) They go 6-2 in their remaining regular-season games and are 2 1/2  games back of the Grizzlies, who remain eighth. They must beat the Grizzlies twice in a row to advance. If they win the first game of the play-in tournament but lose the second, they are done. The Grizzlies would only have to win one game of that two-game set.</p>\n\n<p>Why 22 teams instead of 16?</p>\n\n<p>The cleanest pathway to finishing the season is going straight to the playoffs. Each NBA team is expected to travel to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> with 35 people. Concluding the season with 16 teams instead of 22 teams would mean 210 fewer bodies on campus. That seems significant if the NBA wants to do everything it can to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>Why mess with regular-season games? A play-in tournament? Six more teams than absolutely necessary? The answer is simple: money.</p>\n\n<p>\"The revenue, I'm told, from just having the 16 and going to the playoffs versus 22 and having the play-in and regular-season games (is) several hundred millions more to teams,\" <org>ESPN's</org> <person>Adrian Wojnarowski</person> said on SportsCenter. \"And that is absolutely a factor in this.\"</p>\n\n<p>The NBA is trying to do whatever it can to soften the financial blow the coronavirus has administered.</p>\n\n<p>When will the season conclude?</p>\n\n<p>The NBA season could run well into football season. On Tuesday, <org>ESPN</org> reported Game 7 of the Finals would take place <chron>Oct. 12</chron>, the same date the Saints are supposed to face the Chargers on <org>Monday Night Football</org>. Finishing the abbreviated regular season and playoffs will take a minimum of two months.</p>\n\n<p>The start of the 2020-21 season will be pushed back until December at the earliest, which means that next year's playoffs won't begin until July. Start mentally preparing now for the NBA's most important games to take place during the dog days of summer.</p>\n\n<p>Where do teams go from here?</p>\n\n<p>The next step is for teams to recall players to their home markets so they can begin practicing. Right now, practice facilities are only open for voluntary individual workouts. No more than four players are allowed inside at one time. At the Pelicans' practice facility in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.metrie\">Metairie</location>, only two baskets are available for players to shoot on.</p>\n\n<p>Teams will effectively have to hold a second training camp to get players back into basketball shape. In April, Pelicans coach <person>Alvin Gentry</person> estimated that could take \"20 to 30 days.\"</p>\n\n<p>Last month, executive vice president of basketball operations <person>David Griffin</person> said a little more than half of the Pelicans' players were in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> area. In the coming weeks, expect players who were quarantining outside of market to trickle back to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location> so the Pelicans can restart the process of trying to fight for a playoff spot.</p>",
