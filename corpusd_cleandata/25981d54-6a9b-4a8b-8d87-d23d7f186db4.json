    "text": "A Baraboo man charged with allegedly strangling a woman was recently released\nfrom jail after signing a $500 signature bond.\n\nNorman E. Wilson II, 39, faces more than six years in prison and fines up to\n$11,000 for a felony count of strangulation and suffocation and a misdemeanor\ncharge of disorderly conduct.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed in Sauk County Circuit Court, Baraboo\npolice were called to a residence around 10:30 p.m. May 28 in the 900 block of\nMoore Street. Officers arrived to find Wilson had left the building. A woman\nin the home said Wilson had broken two large windows earlier when she was\noutside of the residence.\n\nThe woman told officers Wilson had left for a while, but had returned yelling\nat her. According to the complaint, when she began moving to another room\nWilson jumped on the couch and began strangling her. She told officers it was\npainful and had significantly cut off her ability to breathe.\n\nAfter warning Wilson not to harm a cat that was near the couch, the woman said\nhe again lunged at her and obstructed her airway. There were also notable\nbruises on the woman's arms and throat area that she said Wilson had caused.\n\nWilson was later located and arrested. He is scheduled to return to court July\n31.",

There  were also notable bruises on the woman's arms and throat area that  she said Wilson had caused.</p>\n\n<p>Wilson was later located and arrested. He is scheduled to return to  court <chron>July 31</chron>.</p>",
