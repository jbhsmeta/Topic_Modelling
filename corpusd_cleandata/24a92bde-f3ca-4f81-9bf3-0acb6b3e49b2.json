    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Engineering\nBusiness Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria,\nVirginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventors Romem, Yaniv\n(Jerusalem, IL); Mann, Omri (Jerusalem, IL); Oshri, Ofer (Kfar Saba, IL),\nfiled on December 10, 2018, was published online on June 8, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent, patent number 10,664,191, is Excelero Storage\nLtd. (Tel Aviv, Israel).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Input/output (I/O) determinism involves utilizing\ninformation related to reading and writing of I/O instructions to more\nefficiently implement such instructions. To provide I/O determinism, a server\nmay require knowledge of the particular architecture of a storage device. For\nexample, the server may require an estimated amount of time for a particular\nI/O instruction to be executed on a storage device. If the instruction will\ntake too long to execute on the storage device, it may be faster to send the\ninstruction to another storage device.\n\n\"Although I/O determinism may increase efficiency of executing I/O\ninstructions, the process requires access to information related to the\nstorage for which I/O instructions are to be executed. This information may\ninclude information that the manufacturer of the storage may not desire to\nshare. Thus, implementation of I/O determinism may not always be practical.\n\n\"It would therefore be advantageous to provide a solution that would overcome\nthe challenges noted above.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors\nalso obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"A summary\nof several example embodiments of the disclosure follows. This summary is\nprovided for the convenience of the reader to provide a basic understanding of\nsuch embodiments and does not wholly define the breadth of the disclosure.\nThis summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and\nis intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments\nnor to delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to\npresent some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a\nprelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. For\nconvenience, the term 'some embodiments' or 'certain embodiments' may be used\nherein to refer to a single embodiment or multiple embodiments of the\ndisclosure.\n\n\"Certain embodiments disclosed herein include a method for providing\ninput/output (I/O) determinism for a server hosting at least a remotely\naccessible storage. The method comprises receiving an I/O instruction and at\nleast one service level indicator from a client device, wherein the at least\none service level indicator includes a required time for executing the I/O\ninstruction; determining whether the I/O instruction can be executed on the\nstorage within the required time; and sending, to the client device, a\nnotification, when it is not determined that the I/O instruction can be\nexecuted on the storage within the required time.\n\n\"Certain embodiments disclosed herein also include a system for providing\ninput/output (I/O) determinism. The system comprises: a storage; a processing\ncircuitry; and a memory, the memory containing instructions that, when\nexecuted by the processing circuitry, configure the system to: receive an I/O\ninstruction and at least one service level indicator from a client device,\nwherein the at least one service level indicator includes a required time for\nexecuting the I/O instruction; determine whether the I/O instruction can be\nexecuted on the storage within the required time; and send, to the client\ndevice, a notification, when it is not determined that the I/O instruction can\nbe executed on the storage within the required time.\n\n\"Certain embodiments disclosed herein also include a method for providing\ninput/output (I/O) determinism for a server hosting at least a storage, the\nserver including a processing circuitry. The method comprises: sending, by the\nprocessing circuitry to the storage, an I/O instruction and at least one\nservice level indicator, wherein the at least one service level indicator\nincludes a required time for executing the I/O instruction; determining, by\nthe storage, whether the I/O instruction can be executed on the storage within\nthe required time; and sending, to the processing circuitry by the storage, a\nnotification, when it is not determined that the I/O instruction can be\nexecuted on the storage within the required time.\n\n\"Certain embodiments disclosed herein also include a system for providing\ninput/output (I/O) determinism.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Engineering Business Daily</org> -- According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.alxdra\">Alexandria, Virginia</location>, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventors Romem, Yaniv (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/il..jerusl\">Jerusalem</location>, IL); Mann, Omri (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/il..jerusl\">Jerusalem</location>, IL); Oshri, Ofer (Kfar Saba, IL), filed on <chron>December 10, 2018</chron>, was published online on <chron>June 8, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The assignee for this patent, patent number 10,664,191, is <org>Excelero Storage Ltd.</org> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/il..telavv\">Tel Aviv, Israel</location>).</p>\n<p>Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;Input/output (I/O) determinism involves utilizing information related to reading and writing of I/O instructions to more efficiently implement such instructions. To provide I/O determinism, a server may require knowledge of the particular architecture of a storage device. For example, the server may require an estimated amount of time for a particular I/O instruction to be executed on a storage device. If the instruction will take too long to execute on the storage device, it may be faster to send the instruction to another storage device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although I/O determinism may increase efficiency of executing I/O instructions, the process requires access to information related to the storage for which I/O instructions are to be executed. This information may include information that the manufacturer of the storage may not desire to share. Thus, implementation of I/O determinism may not always be practical.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It would therefore be advantageous to provide a solution that would overcome the challenges noted above.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;A summary of several example embodiments of the disclosure follows.
