Having in mind that these acts were adopted in the <org>House of Representatives</org> of PFBiH, and that they need to be on the agenda of the <org>House of Peoples</org> of PFBiH, it was decided that the representatives of the coordination hold meetings with the leaderships of both houses as soon as possible, in order to speed up their adoption.</p>\n<p>Representatives of the fighters thanked the FBiH Government and the <org>Federal Ministry</org> for the fact that disability benefits and other regular monthly incomes from the FBiH Budget were paid on time and without reduction during the crisis that hit the world and our country.</p>\n<p>It was agreed to continue joint action, which in the previous period resulted in significant steps in terms of improving the status of veterans and their families, especially due to the adoption of the Law on the Rights of Demobilized Veterans and Their Families.</p>",
