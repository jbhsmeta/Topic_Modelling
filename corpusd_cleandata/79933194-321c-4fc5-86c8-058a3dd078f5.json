    "text": "LEXINGTON, Massachusetts, June 4 \\-- Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. issued the\nfollowing news release:\n\nAldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALDX) (Aldeyra), a clinical-stage\nbiotechnology company focused on the development of novel therapies with the\npotential to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases,\ntoday announced that, based on preliminary written comments and meeting\ndiscussion, agreement has been reached with the US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) for the use of RASP (reactive aldehyde species) as an\nobjective sign for the treatment of dry eye disease.\n\nRASP are pre-cytokine pro-inflammatory mediators that are elevated in the\ntears of patients with dry eye disease,1 and correlate with dry eye disease\nsymptoms and signs.2 In a Phase 2a dry eye disease clinical trial, Aldeyra's\ninvestigational first-in-class RASP inhibitor reproxalap demonstrated\nreduction in tear RASP levels following 28 days of treatment. In in vitro\nstudies, RASP were eliminated within 60 to 90 minutes when exposed to\nreproxalap at equimolar concentrations. Reproxalap, when administered\ntopically to the eye, is thought to be more than 500-fold in excess of tear\nRASP levels, and has demonstrated consistent statistically significant and\nclinically relevant activity in dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, and\nother forms of ocular inflammation across numerous Phase 2 and Phase 3\nclinical trials.\n\n\"Representing the first novel objective sign for the treatment in dry eye\ndisease in over a decade, RASP are critical mediators of inflammation,\" stated\nTodd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aldeyra.\n\"We look forward to continuing to advance reproxalap, our novel RASP inhibitor\nin Phase 3 clinical trials for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis,\ntoward NDA filing.\"\n\nAldeyra expects to provide an update on clinical development plans and\nremaining NDA requirements for reproxalap in dry eye disease following receipt\nof FDA meeting minutes, which are anticipated in July 2020.\n\nAbout Aldeyra Therapeutics\n\nAldeyra Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the\ndevelopment of novel therapies with the potential to improve the lives of\npatients with immune-mediated diseases. Two of the company's lead compounds,\nreproxalap and ADX-629, target reactive aldehyde species (RASP), which are\nelevated in ocular and systemic inflammatory disease, leading to elevated\nlevels of cytokine release via activation of a broad array of inflammatory\nfactors, including NF-\u03baB, inflammasomes, and Scavenger Receptor A. Reproxalap\nis being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with dry eye disease\nand allergic conjunctivitis. The company's clinical pipeline also includes\nADX-2191, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor in Phase 3 testing for\nproliferative vitreoretinopathy, and ADX-1612, a chaperome inhibitor in Phase\n2 testing for COVID-19 and ovarian cancer.

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.lexton\">LEXINGTON, Massachusetts</location>, <chron>June 4</chron> -- <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-SMALL:ALDX\">Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.</org> issued the following news release:</p><p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-SMALL:ALDX\">Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.</org> (Nasdaq: ALDX) (Aldeyra), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel therapies with the potential to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases, today announced that, based on preliminary written comments and meeting discussion, agreement has been reached with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0682203466\">US Food and Drug Administration</org> (FDA) for the use of RASP (reactive aldehyde species) as an objective sign for the treatment of dry eye disease.</p><p>RASP are pre-cytokine pro-inflammatory mediators that are elevated in the tears of patients with dry eye disease,1 and correlate with dry eye disease symptoms and signs.2 In a Phase 2a dry eye disease clinical trial, Aldeyra&#8217;s investigational first-in-class RASP inhibitor reproxalap demonstrated reduction in tear RASP levels following 28 days of treatment. In in vitro studies, RASP were eliminated within 60 to 90 minutes when exposed to reproxalap at equimolar concentrations. Reproxalap, when administered topically to the eye, is thought to be more than 500-fold in excess of tear RASP levels, and has demonstrated consistent statistically significant and clinically relevant activity in dry eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, and other forms of ocular inflammation across numerous Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.</p><p>&#8220;Representing the first novel objective sign for the treatment in dry eye disease in over a decade, RASP are critical mediators of inflammation,&#8221; stated <person>Todd C. Brady</person>, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aldeyra. &#8220;We look forward to continuing to advance reproxalap, our novel RASP inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical trials for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, toward NDA filing.&#8221;</p><p>Aldeyra expects to provide an update on clinical development plans and remaining NDA requirements for reproxalap in dry eye disease following receipt of FDA meeting minutes, which are anticipated in <chron>July 2020</chron>.</p><p>About <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-SMALL:ALDX\">Aldeyra Therapeutics</org></p><p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-SMALL:ALDX\">Aldeyra Therapeutics</org> is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel therapies with the potential to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases. Two of the company&#8217;s lead compounds, reproxalap and ADX-629, target reactive aldehyde species (RASP), which are elevated in ocular and systemic inflammatory disease, leading to elevated levels of cytokine release via activation of a broad array of inflammatory factors, including NF-&#954;B, inflammasomes, and Scavenger Receptor A. Reproxalap is being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis. The company&#8217;s clinical pipeline also includes ADX-2191, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor in Phase 3 testing for proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and ADX-1612, a chaperome inhibitor in Phase 2 testing for COVID-19 and ovarian cancer.
