    "text": "Barbara Rumrill Dahn, 69, of Cazenovia, lived a dozen or so lives during her\ntime on earth. She passed away Saturday, May 30, 2020, peacefully, in her\nsleep, and, we trust, laughing in her dreams.\n\nBorn in 1950 in Gloversville, N.Y., she grew up surrounded by creativity and\nintellectual curiosity. Her mother, Mary, was a respected watercolorist of the\nAdirondack region. Her father, Donald, was a union plumber who became a noted\nself-taught archeologist. Her late brother, Donald, became an aerospace\nengineer.\n\nWith Eric Dahn, her husband with whom she spent 35 years, she raised Tristan\nand Curtis. She passed on her courage to her sons, teaching them to stand for\nwhat they believed and nurturing them as they explored their passions and\ndefined their dreams. She was an active member of her town Democratic\nCommittee. As Associate Director of CSTEP at Cazenovia College she generously\nmentored to and advocated for under-represented students, making every\nresource available, from academic tutoring to a weekend in her home. As a\nfriend, she gave generously of her infectious optimism and unbridled joy.\n\nIn her 50s she graduated from Syracuse University with a bachelor's degree in\nanthropology. After retiring, Barb took up her passion as a visual artist. She\nleft nothing offered untasted, no adventure that came her way untried. Want to\nsee her Woodstock ticket? She still carried it. Don't know about her treks in\nthe Himalayas? See her incredible photography. A lifelong love of skiing and\nthe mountains took her to Europe multiple times to teach young athletes. As an\noffshore sailor, she sailed the world's oceans with friends from many\ndifferent countries. Whether she was cursing an albatross on a nonstop passage\nfrom Panama to Alaska, repairing a toilet she broke while crossing the equator\nor falling through a rotted hatch in Guatemala, Barb always laughed.\n\nShe is survived by her son, Curtis, of Berkeley, California, his wife, Sarah\nTrist, and their three-year-old son, Juna; her son, Tristan, of Philadelphia\nand his partner, Enrica; her sister-in-law, Lynn, of Apalachin, N.Y.; her\nniece, Jane, of Salem, MA, and her partner, Ryan. She is preceded in death by\nher husband, Eric.\n\nA private burial was held at Greensprings Natural Cemetery Preserve in\nNewfield, N.Y. When conditions allow, a public celebration of her life will be\nheld.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to Doctors without\nBorders. Birnbaum funeral service Inc. had arrangements.",

    "html": "<p><person>Barbara Rumrill Dahn</person>, 69, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.cazvia\">Cazenovia</location>, lived a dozen or so lives during her time on earth. She passed away <chron>Saturday, May 30, 2020</chron>, peacefully, in her sleep, and, we trust, laughing in her dreams.</p>\n<p>Born in 1950 in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.glolle\">Gloversville, N.Y.</location>, she grew up surrounded by creativity and intellectual curiosity. Her mother, Mary, was a respected watercolorist of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.adiack\">Adirondack</location> region. Her father, Donald, was a union plumber who became a noted self-taught archeologist. Her late brother, Donald, became an aerospace engineer.</p>\n\n<p>With <person>Eric Dahn</person>, her husband with whom she spent 35 years, she raised Tristan and Curtis. She passed on her courage to her sons, teaching them to stand for what they believed and nurturing them as they explored their passions and defined their dreams. She was an active member of her town Democratic Committee. As Associate Director of CSTEP at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2807557987\">Cazenovia College</org> she generously mentored to and advocated for under-represented students, making every resource available, from academic tutoring to a weekend in her home. As a friend, she gave generously of her infectious optimism and unbridled joy.</p>\n\n<p>In her 50s she graduated from <org>Syracuse University</org> with a bachelor's degree in anthropology. After retiring, Barb took up her passion as a visual artist. She left nothing offered untasted, no adventure that came her way untried. Want to see her <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.wooock\">Woodstock</location> ticket? She still carried it. Don't know about her treks in the Himalayas? See her incredible photography. A lifelong love of skiing and the mountains took her to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location> multiple times to teach young athletes. As an offshore sailor, she sailed the world's oceans with friends from many different countries. Whether she was cursing an albatross on a nonstop passage from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pa\">Panama</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ak\">Alaska</location>, repairing a toilet she broke while crossing the equator or falling through a rotted hatch in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gt\">Guatemala</location>, Barb always laughed.</p>\n\n<p>She is survived by her son, Curtis, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.berley\">Berkeley, California</location>, his wife, <person>Sarah Trist</person>, and their three-year-old son, Juna; her son, Tristan, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> and his partner, Enrica; her sister-in-law, Lynn, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.apahin\">Apalachin, N.Y.</location>; her niece, Jane, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.salem\">Salem, MA</location>, and her partner, Ryan. She is preceded in death by her husband, Eric.</p>\n\n<p>A private burial was held at <location>Greensprings Natural Cemetery Preserve</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.neweld\">Newfield, N.Y.</location> When conditions allow, a public celebration of her life will be held.</p>\n\n<p>In lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4050840264\">Doctors without Borders</org>. Birnbaum funeral service Inc. had arrangements.</p>",
