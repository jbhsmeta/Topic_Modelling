    "text": "There has been a lot of talk about growing your own food lately and for good\nreason. When you grow your own food, you can cultivate your crops however you\nwould like, knowing what you put in your family's mouths was cared for with\nyour own hands.\n\nAlso, you can cut down on spending, going out in public and the uncertainty of\nwhat will or will not be available at the store. How rewarding is that? But we\nare all more than mouths to feed right?\n\nHans Christian Andersen had a point when he said, \"Just living is not enough;\none must have sunshine, freedom and a little flower.\" Surely there is some\nroom in your garden, near your house or in your yard for \"a little flower?\"\n\nFlowers speak to us in ways that a homegrown cabbage simply cannot. Why\nneglect beauties such as roses, lupine, nasturtiums and the ever-charming\nfoxglove when they awaken more than the mouth and stomach? You will find, as I\nhave, that it is very simple to tuck a rose bush here, a columbine there and a\npatch of bearded irises on that small rocky rise that is a terrible trouble to\nmow.\n\nFlowers take us back in time to Grandma's garden scented with lilacs and\noverflowing with bleeding hearts. They keep us from forgetting why we grow\nthings.\n\nFlowers remind us to (sorry) \"stop and smell the roses.\"\n\nAnd aren't they right in this? Aren't we hurtling along most days at a speed\nthat keeps us from enjoying the verdant hills of our area, not to mention the\npink ragged robin, marsh marigolds and blue-flag irises blooming on our\nroadsides?\n\nTake a moment and think about that spot in your garden where nothing will\ngrow. Is it under a tree? A bit dry? Partly sunny?\n\nFind yourself some baptisia australis (blue wild indigo or false indigo) to\nplant there. Baptisia is a tough, pea family member with purple spikes of\nflowers and somewhat tall, sturdy stems. Native to a large area of the eastern\nstates, the Midwest and into Canada, baptisia is loved by hummingbirds, not by\ndeer and its deep taproot helps it to survive in dry soil.\n\nAnd please do give roses a chance. I know \u0091they are too fickle,' you say, and\n\u0091I don't know how to prune, or when, or why,' you say. I had a friend who grew\nmore than 300 roses in his front and back yards. He had had cancer and a\nstroke that had rendered one arm useless. He could barely walk and rode around\non a Rascal scooter pruning, watering, propagating, and tending his roses.\n\nIf he can do it, that's right, so can you. If you need a little encouragement,\ncontact me. I was lucky enough to be tutored under this man. Roses are only\nslightly more time consuming than your average perennial but the bragging\nrights, the beauty and the pride from growing your own is worth those few\nextra minutes.\n\nTake a look at the British rose breeder David Austin's website for inspiration\nand ideas at [davidaustinroses.com/us](http://davidaustinroses.com/us).\n\nFlowers are not a means to an end; they will never satisfy our physical\nhunger. Flowers satisfy a different sort of hunger: they open our eyes to the\nunseen mystery of growth.\n\nFlowers go through the same life cycle that all plants go through with one\nastounding moment of beauty that feeds pollinators and lifts our hearts. They\nremind us that life is not really a journey with a material destination but a\nseries of moments that should be lived playfully, aesthetically and with great\njoy.\n\nDon't forget flowers this year! And as my rose-growing friend always said,\nwith a twinkle in his eye, \"Don't forget to stop and smell the roses.\"\n\nFor a list of nurseries in and near Madison County, please visit\n[madisoncountycce.org/gardening/local-nurseries-\ngreenhouses](http://madisoncountycce.org/gardening/local-nurseries-\ngreenhouses).\n\nCornell Cooperative Extension is an employer and educator recognized for\nvaluing AA/EEO, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities and\nprovides equal program and employment opportunities.",

    "title": "CORNELL IN OUR COMMUNITY\n\nFlowers: Food for the heart, mind and soul",
    "html": "<p>There has been a lot of talk about growing your own food lately and for good reason. When you grow your own food, you can cultivate your crops however you would like, knowing what you put in your family's mouths was cared for with your own hands.</p>\n<p>Also, you can cut down on spending, going out in public and the uncertainty of what will or will not be available at the store. How rewarding is that? But we are all more than mouths to feed right?</p>\n\n<p><person>Hans Christian Andersen</person> had a point when he said, \"Just living is not enough; one must have sunshine, freedom and a little flower.\" Surely there is some room in your garden, near your house or in your yard for \"a little flower?\"</p>\n\n<p>Flowers speak to us in ways that a homegrown cabbage simply cannot. Why neglect beauties such as roses, lupine, nasturtiums and the ever-charming foxglove when they awaken more than the mouth and stomach? You will find, as I have, that it is very simple to tuck a rose bush here, a columbine there and a patch of bearded irises on that small rocky rise that is a terrible trouble to mow.</p>\n\n<p>Flowers take us back in time to Grandma's garden scented with lilacs and overflowing with bleeding hearts. They keep us from forgetting why we grow things.</p>\n\n<p>Flowers remind us to (sorry) \"stop and smell the roses.\"</p>\n\n<p>And aren't they right in this? Aren't we hurtling along most days at a speed that keeps us from enjoying the verdant hills of our area, not to mention the pink ragged robin, marsh marigolds and blue-flag irises blooming on our roadsides?</p>\n\n<p>Take a moment and think about that spot in your garden where nothing will grow. Is it under a tree? A bit dry? Partly sunny?</p>\n\n<p>Find yourself some baptisia australis (blue wild indigo or false indigo) to plant there. Baptisia is a tough, pea family member with purple spikes of flowers and somewhat tall, sturdy stems. Native to a large area of the eastern states, the Midwest and into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, baptisia is loved by hummingbirds, not by deer and its deep taproot helps it to survive in dry soil.</p>\n\n<p>And please do give roses a chance. I know &#145;they are too fickle,' you say, and &#145;I don't know how to prune, or when, or why,' you say. I had a friend who grew more than 300 roses in his front and back yards. He had had cancer and a stroke that had rendered one arm useless. He could barely walk and rode around on a Rascal scooter pruning, watering, propagating, and tending his roses.</p>\n\n<p>If he can do it, that's right, so can you. If you need a little encouragement, contact me. I was lucky enough to be tutored under this man. Roses are only slightly more time consuming than your average perennial but the bragging rights, the beauty and the pride from growing your own is worth those few extra minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the British rose breeder <person>David Austin's</person> website for inspiration and ideas at <a href=\"http://davidaustinroses.com/us\">davidaustinroses.com/us</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Flowers are not a means to an end; they will never satisfy our physical hunger. Flowers satisfy a different sort of hunger: they open our eyes to the unseen mystery of growth.</p>\n\n<p>Flowers go through the same life cycle that all plants go through with one astounding moment of beauty that feeds pollinators and lifts our hearts. They remind us that life is not really a journey with a material destination but a series of moments that should be lived playfully, aesthetically and with great joy.</p>\n\n<p>Don't forget flowers this year! And as my rose-growing friend always said, with a twinkle in his eye, \"Don't forget to stop and smell the roses.\"</p>\n\n<p>For a list of nurseries in and near Madison County, please visit <a href=\"http://madisoncountycce.org/gardening/local-nurseries-greenhouses\">madisoncountycce.org/gardening/local-nurseries-greenhouses</a>.</p>\n\n<p>    <org>Cornell Cooperative Extension</org> is an employer and educator recognized for valuing AA/EEO, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities and provides equal program and employment opportunities.</p>",
