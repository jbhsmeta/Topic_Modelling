    "text": "Sean Stutzman, who played three years in the Houston Astros organization,\nconfirmed his retirement to the Journal & Topics Wednesday, May 13.\n\nStutzman was a star pitcher for Fremd High School in Palatine. He played under\nChris Piggott and was the 2011 MSL West Player of the Year. Stutzman also\nearned all-conference honors as a junior and senior. He was named American\nLegion Cook County Tournament MVP.\n\nStutzman played college baseball for Dallas Baptist, going an impressive 14-2\nover his last two seasons. He started his career with Des Moines Area\nCommunity College, playing in 2012, before sitting out 2013. Stutzman competed\nat Dallas Baptist from 2014-16.\n\nHe was not selected in the MLB Draft in 2016, but signed with the Houston\nAstros June 21, 2016. Stutzman joined the Astros short season-A team, Tri-City\nValleyCats. He went 2-2 with a 5.40 ERA in 15 appearances, making 2 saves in\n23.1 innings.\n\nStutzman had a career year in 2017, pitching for three different teams in the\nAstros organization.\n\n\"I was honestly unstoppable in 2017,\" Stutzman said. \"My confidence was the\nhighest it's ever been and every time I stepped on the mound, it was like I\ncould do no wrong.\"\n\nHe collected plenty of flying miles over the season, bouncing from the Corpus\nChristi Hooks (Double-A), Fresno Grizzlies (Triple-A) and Buies Creek Astros\n(Advanced-A). He went from Corpus Christi to Fresno to Corpus Christi to Buies\nCreek and finally to Corpus Christi.\n\nFor the 2017 season, he went a combined 3-2 with a 2.28 ERA in 33 appearances\nwith 3 saves in 67 innings. Stutzman struck out 72 and walked 23 over the 2017\nseason. His best work was with Buies Creek in Advanced-A, where he went 2-1\nwith a 1.10 ERA in 16 appearances. Stutzman made 3 saves in 32.2 innings of\nwork. He held opponents to a .140 batting average for Buies Creek.\n\nThen 2018 happened.\n\n\"I hit a bit of a rough patch to start the season and when you're a free agent\n(signee), not much room for error,\" Stutzman said. \"Once I got released, I was\nin my own head and never got back in my groove. I figured out some good stuff\nthat worked for me to be successful in 2017 and then in the offseason I tried\nto do too much and improve literally everything, which had a negative effect.\nIn 2017 my velocity was 90-93 (MPH) and in 2018 it was 87-90. If I could go\nback, I would simplify a lot of things with my offseason.\"\n\nIn 15 appearances in 2018 for Corpus Christi, he went 2-4 in 15 games with a\n5.84 ERA. Opponents went from batting .201 against him in 2017 to .275 in\n2018.\n\n\"2018 was different,\" Stutzman said. \"I felt like I wasn't doing enough so I\nput added pressure on myself and then when I wouldn't have a good game, my\nnext game I'd be stressing more. I was always strong mentally throughout my\ncareer, but parts of 2018 I let that slip. And then when I got released (June\n6, 2018), that's 100% when my career ended.\"\n\nOver three seasons with the Astros organization, he went 7-8 with a 3.68 ERA,\n5 saves, 110 strikeouts and 57 walks in 63 games and 115 innings pitched.\n\nHe decided to try and keep his playing career alive, joining the Texas AirHogs\nof American Association independent baseball. That's the same league Rosemont-\nbased Chicago Dogs compete in.\n\n\"My mind was never fully into independent ball,\" Stutzman said. \"I thought I\nbelonged in affiliated ball, so that affected me. Finally I asked for my\nrelease last year because I wasn't having fun and I knew I wasn't fully\ninvested. And that's not who I am. So I thought it was best for me to ask for\nmy release and take a few months off before I decided to try to play again.\"\n\nHe went 0-5 with an 8.20 ERA in 17 games with Texas in 2018. Stutzman went 2-1\nin 2019, but posted an 8.17 ERA in 16 games. Over his two seasons with Texas,\nhe went 2-6 with an 8.19 ERA in 33 games. He struck out 70 and walked 51 in\n73.2 innings. He was never mentally into independent baseball and his results\nshowed, but he wasn't ready to completely stop.\n\nAfter some thought he wanted to give baseball another shot.\n\n\"I decided I did want to play again, but I wasn't going to play independent\nball,\" Stutzman said. \"I threw for a lot of scouts and talked to a lot. At one\npoint, I almost signed with the Indians this offseason, but that fell through.\nIt came to a point where I didn't think anything was going to happen, so I\ntalked with my family and wife about it and told them (I was retiring). They\nobviously didn't like what I had to say, but mentally and emotionally, it had\nto be done. The last two years, baseball took a drastic mental toll on me in\nlife in general.\"\n\nNow he resides in Texas and he is helping coach a high school summer team in\nthe Canes Southwest organization which has multiple locations throughout the\nstate of Texas. Stutzman coaches in the Dallas metroplex area.\n\nTalking about his struggles wasn't easy, but he hopes others can learn from\nhim, especially as he begins his coaching career.\n\n\"It took me a while to talk about it because I wasn't over being released,\"\nStutzman said. \"But I finally sat down with my parents and talked with them\nand honestly it helped a ton. Now I have no problem talking like this. It's\nnot easy. It's a grind with the good and bad. I enjoy helping people now and\ngiving lessons and coaching because I learned so much through 21 years of\nplaying baseball and my years of playing D1 and pro ball.\"\n\nWith years of experience and knowledge, look for him to make an immediate\nimpact as a coach.",

    "html": "<p><person>Sean Stutzman</person>, who played three years in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131556\">Houston Astros</org> organization, confirmed his retirement to the Journal &amp; Topics <chron>Wednesday, May 13</chron>.</p>\n<p>Stutzman was a star pitcher for <org>Fremd High School</org> in Palatine. He played under <person>Chris Piggott</person> and was the 2011 MSL West Player of the Year. Stutzman also earned all-conference honors as a junior and senior. He was named American Legion Cook County Tournament MVP.</p>\n\n<p>Stutzman played college baseball for <org>Dallas Baptist</org>, going an impressive 14-2 over his last two seasons. He started his career with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0596207922\">Des Moines Area Community College</org>, playing in 2012, before sitting out 2013. Stutzman competed at <org>Dallas Baptist</org> from 2014-16.</p>\n\n<p>He was not selected in the MLB Draft in 2016, but signed with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131556\">Houston Astros</org> <chron>June 21, 2016</chron>. Stutzman joined the <org>Astros</org> short season-A team, Tri-City ValleyCats. He went 2-2 with a 5.40 ERA in 15 appearances, making 2 saves in 23.1 innings.</p>\n\n<p>Stutzman had a career year in 2017, pitching for three different teams in the <org>Astros</org> organization.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was honestly unstoppable in 2017,\" Stutzman said. \"My confidence was the highest it's ever been and every time I stepped on the mound, it was like I could do no wrong.\"</p>\n\n<p>He collected plenty of flying miles over the season, bouncing from the Corpus <person>Christi Hooks</person> (Double-A), Fresno Grizzlies (Triple-A) and Buies Creek Astros (Advanced-A). He went from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\">Corpus Christi</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.fresno\">Fresno</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\">Corpus Christi</location> to <location>Buies Creek</location> and finally to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\">Corpus Christi</location>.</p>\n\n<p>For the 2017 season, he went a combined 3-2 with a 2.28 ERA in 33 appearances with 3 saves in 67 innings. Stutzman struck out 72 and walked 23 over the 2017 season. His best work was with <location>Buies Creek</location> in Advanced-A, where he went 2-1 with a 1.10 ERA in 16 appearances. Stutzman made 3 saves in 32.2 innings of work. He held opponents to a .140 batting average for <location>Buies Creek</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Then 2018 happened.</p>\n\n<p>\"I hit a bit of a rough patch to start the season and when you're a free agent (signee), not much room for error,\" Stutzman said. \"Once I got released, I was in my own head and never got back in my groove. I figured out some good stuff that worked for me to be successful in 2017 and then in the offseason I tried to do too much and improve literally everything, which had a negative effect. In 2017 my velocity was 90-93 (MPH) and in 2018 it was 87-90. If I could go back, I would simplify a lot of things with my offseason.\"</p>\n\n<p>In 15 appearances in 2018 for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.corsti\">Corpus Christi</location>, he went 2-4 in 15 games with a 5.84 ERA. Opponents went from batting .201 against him in 2017 to .275 in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>\"2018 was different,\" Stutzman said. \"I felt like I wasn't doing enough so I put added pressure on myself and then when I wouldn't have a good game, my next game I'd be stressing more. I was always strong mentally throughout my career, but parts of 2018 I let that slip. And then when I got released (<chron>June 6, 2018</chron>), that's 100% when my career ended.\"</p>\n\n<p>Over three seasons with the <org>Astros</org> organization, he went 7-8 with a 3.68 ERA, 5 saves, 110 strikeouts and 57 walks in 63 games and 115 innings pitched.</p>\n\n<p>He decided to try and keep his playing career alive, joining the Texas AirHogs of <org>American Association</org> independent baseball. That's the same league Rosemont-based Chicago Dogs compete in.</p>\n\n<p>\"My mind was never fully into independent ball,\" Stutzman said. \"I thought I belonged in affiliated ball, so that affected me. Finally I asked for my release last year because I wasn't having fun and I knew I wasn't fully invested. And that's not who I am. So I thought it was best for me to ask for my release and take a few months off before I decided to try to play again.\"</p>\n\n<p>He went 0-5 with an 8.20 ERA in 17 games with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> in 2018. Stutzman went 2-1 in 2019, but posted an 8.17 ERA in 16 games. Over his two seasons with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>, he went 2-6 with an 8.19 ERA in 33 games. He struck out 70 and walked 51 in 73.2 innings. He was never mentally into independent baseball and his results showed, but he wasn't ready to completely stop.</p>\n\n<p>After some thought he wanted to give baseball another shot.</p>\n\n<p>\"I decided I did want to play again, but I wasn't going to play independent ball,\" Stutzman said. \"I threw for a lot of scouts and talked to a lot. At one point, I almost signed with the Indians this offseason, but that fell through. It came to a point where I didn't think anything was going to happen, so I talked with my family and wife about it and told them (I was retiring). They obviously didn't like what I had to say, but mentally and emotionally, it had to be done. The last two years, baseball took a drastic mental toll on me in life in general.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now he resides in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> and he is helping coach a high school summer team in the Canes Southwest organization which has multiple locations throughout the state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>. Stutzman coaches in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.dallas\">Dallas</location> metroplex area.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about his struggles wasn't easy, but he hopes others can learn from him, especially as he begins his coaching career.</p>\n\n<p>\"It took me a while to talk about it because I wasn't over being released,\" Stutzman said. \"But I finally sat down with my parents and talked with them and honestly it helped a ton. Now I have no problem talking like this. It's not easy. It's a grind with the good and bad. I enjoy helping people now and giving lessons and coaching because I learned so much through 21 years of playing baseball and my years of playing D1 and pro ball.\"</p>\n\n<p>With years of experience and knowledge, look for him to make an immediate impact as a coach.</p>",
