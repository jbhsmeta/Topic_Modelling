    "text": "While many countries remain in lockdown or are slowly starting to ease\nrestrictions, Australia began opening up public beaches and relaxing rules in\nlate April and has continued staying ahead of the curve in its efforts to\nprotect its citizens' lives.\n\nAs of May 26, with a population of 25.7 million, Australia has seen\napproximately 7,133 cases and 102 deaths as a result of the CCP (Chinese\nCommunist Party) virus, commonly known as the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn contrast, as of May 26, Canada, with 37.9 million people, recorded more\nthan 87,000 cases and more than 6,600 deaths.\n\nBy early April, Financial Times journalist John Burn-Murdoch had already taken\nnote: Australia a rare example of an Anglophone country on a gentle\ntrajectory, he wrote on Twitter.\n\nNow that more businesses are reopening and more internal travel bans are being\nlifted, some sense of normalcy is gradually returning.\n\nWhile no one knows when and how the pandemic will end, it's important to\nreflect on how a country like Australia managed to beat the odds and what it\ncan do to stay the course as it tackles complex challenges ahead across all\nsectors of society.\n\nIn this regard, much of Canberra's success appears to stem from its vigilance\nwhen it comes to the Chinese communist regime.\n\nProtecting National Security\n\nA key move that helped Australia contain the spread of the virus was to stop\narrivals of visitors from China on Feb. 1-despite Beijing's protestations and\nagainst World Health Organization (WHO) advice.\n\nThis was the right decision and one of the most important decisions made by an\nAustralian government in decades, Health Minister Greg Hunt recently told Sky\nNews.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Chinese regime's hoarding of personal protective\nequipment in January and February, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and hand\nsanitizer, led to shortages worldwide. Australia was no exception. As The\nEpoch Times previously reported, the regime had directed its United Front Work\nDepartment to mobilize overseas pro-Beijing groups to buy large quantities of\nthese vital medical supplies and ship them to China.\n\nGreenland Group and Risland, two Chinese-linked companies in Australia, were\nwidely reported by Australian media to have sent large volumes of protective\nequipment to China. According to Chinese government data, Beijing amassed an\nestimated 2.5 billion pieces of protective equipment in just two months.\n\nCanberra promptly announced a ban on the noncommercial export of these\nsupplies, stipulating fines and jail terms for violators.\n\nMeanwhile, global concerns arose over foreign takeovers of distressed\ncompanies amid the pandemic, especially by authoritarian states like Beijing,\nthat could undermine supply chains and countries' national security.\n\nIn response, on March 29, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced\nchanges to the country's foreign investment review policy, requiring every\nproposed foreign takeover to be reviewed regardless of value.\n\nThis was to avoid predatory behavior that is not in the national interest and\nwould be effective for the duration of the current crisis, he said.\n\nCoincidentally, data from Australia's Health Department indicated a noticeable\ndownward trend of new daily cases shortly after that day, continuing until\ntoday.\n\nDefying Coercion\n\nThen in mid-April, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for an\nindependent review into the pandemic's origins including Beijing's handling of\nthe initial outbreak in Wuhan. She quickly received backing from shadow\nforeign minister Penny Wong followed by support from Prime Minister Scott\nMorrison and others.\n\nThe Chinese regime tried to discredit the request by accusing Canberra of\npoliticizing the pandemic and warning that Chinese citizens may boycott\nAustralia in various areas including beef, wine, tourism, and international\nstudents.\n\nWhen Canberra refused to back down, Beijing banned beef imports from four\nmajor Australian producers and imposed 80 percent tariffs on Australian\nbarley.\n\nDespite Beijing's disinformation and economic coercion, Canberra remained\nfirm, winning support from more than 120 countries for a co-sponsored motion\nseeking an independent evaluation of the global response to COVID-19 including\nthe source of the virus and its route of transmission to humans. The WHO\npassed the motion at a virtual assembly on May 19.\n\nDeterring Foreign Interference and Spying\n\nAustralia's response to the CCP during the pandemic is consistent with its\nactions in recent years that clearly show its growing awareness of the urgency\nand necessity of resisting the threats posed by the communist regime.\n\nThese threats are not limited to health and economic consequences, but also\ninclude significant political interference and espionage activities.\n\nIn 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a report on the extent\nof foreign interference in Australia. The classified report, which was leaked\nto the media in 2018, found that the CCP over the past decade had made\nattempts to influence Australian political parties and policy-making at every\nlevel of government.\n\nIn response, Turnbull's government introduced legislation that banned foreign\ndonations to political candidates, broadened the definition of espionage\nactivities, and required all those working on behalf of foreign entities to\npublicly declare who they work for.\n\nAustralia was also one of the first countries to ban Huawei from its 5G\nnetworks on national security grounds. In 2018, Canberra blocked Huawei from\nproviding 5G technology to Australia, while barring ZTE, another Chinese tech\ncompany, at the same time.\n\nThe fundamental issue is one of trust between nations in cyberspace, wrote\nSimeon Gilding, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\n(ASPI), in a commentary in January.\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party has destroyed that trust\nthrough its scaled and indiscriminate hacking of foreign networks and its\ndetermination to direct and control Chinese tech companies, said Gilding, who\nuntil December 2019 was head of the Australian Signals Directorate's signals\nintelligence and offensive cyber missions.\n\nDue to concerns about cyberattacks originating from China, Australia had\nalready excluded Huawei from bidding on a project to build out the country's\nnational broadband network back in 2012.\n\n'Seek Wider Trade Options,' 'Look to Real Friends'\n\nCanberra's vigilance combined with informed and timely action against the CCP\ncould well be the most significant factor contributing to Australia's\nmuchbetter-than-expected pandemic outcome thus far. It also attests to the\nkind of sound China policy and direction that will likely continue to serve\nthe country well in the critical times ahead.\n\nIn this context, there is bipartisan backing and broad public support for\nCanberra's decisions including its Huawei ban and its leadership in pushing\nfor a global inquiry into the pandemic. And Beijing's overt use of coercion\nand disinformation has damaged its own image and helped to alert Australians\nto the serious threat that it poses.\n\nManaging relations with an assertive China requires Australian patience,\nconsistency and steadfastness on policy over the long term, wrote Richard\nMaude, executive director of policy at the Asia Society Australia, in an\narticle in May. Maude is also a former Australian deputy secretary of foreign\naffairs and trade.\n\nThe task is harder because China increasingly is conducting its diplomacy in a\nmanner it would never accept from others. That diminishes China but is the\nnature of authoritarian power.\n\nVicky Xiuzhong Xu, an analyst at ASPI, wrote in an opinion piece that\nAustralia must not bow to China but seek wider trade options and look to our\nreal friends.\n\nIn her article, published by the Sydney Morning Herald on May 21, Xu advised\nforming a strong alliance with like-minded nations and thinking long-term in\nreducing reliance on China to better allow Australia to overcome Beijing's\ntactics.\n\nUpholding Values, Strengthened by Faith\n\nA survey by Newgate Australia conducted in the third week of May shows that 79\npercent of Australians believe the country is responding to the pandemic at an\nappropriate level and that 67 percent believe the government is doing a good\nor excellent job. Despite concerns about the economy and jobs, Australians\ncontinue to have strong faith in the performance and actions of government,\nthe survey found.\n\nAustralia's prime minister, in turn, has strong spiritual faith. In a video\npublished in March on the website Eternity News, Morrison says a prayer for\nhis country and people, as well as his government colleagues. He prayed for\nGod to give us strength in this country, give us wisdom, give us judgment,\ngive us encouragement, and let your peace reign.\n\nMorrison has also declared that Australia would never trade away our values\nand would deal with other countries fairly and honestly and openly, The\nGuardian reported in May.\n\nWe have always been independent ... and we will always stand our ground when\nit comes to the things that we believe in and the values that we uphold, he\nsaid.\n\nThe author of this article is a Chinese contributor using a pen name to\nprotect their identity. As Chinese contributors and staffmembers of The Epoch\nTimes and their relatives have been harassed, imprisoned, and disappeared in\nChina, we protect their identities when necessary to avoid further persecution\nby the Chinese communist regime.",

As The Epoch Times previously reported, the regime had directed its <org>United Front Work Department</org> to mobilize overseas pro-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location> groups to buy large quantities of these vital medical supplies and ship them to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.</p>\n<p><org>Greenland Group</org> and Risland, two Chinese-linked companies in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, were widely reported by Australian media to have sent large volumes of protective equipment to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. According to Chinese government data, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location> amassed an estimated 2.5 billion pieces of protective equipment in just two months.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra</location> promptly announced a ban on the noncommercial export of these supplies, stipulating fines and jail terms for violators.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, global concerns arose over foreign takeovers of distressed companies amid the pandemic, especially by authoritarian states like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location>, that could undermine supply chains and countries' national security.</p>\n<p>In response, on <chron>March 29</chron>, Australian Treasurer <person>Josh Frydenberg</person> announced changes to the country's foreign investment review policy, requiring every proposed foreign takeover to be reviewed regardless of value.</p>\n<p>This was to avoid predatory behavior that is not in the national interest and would be effective for the duration of the current crisis, he said.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, data from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia's</location> <org>Health Department</org> indicated a noticeable downward trend of new daily cases shortly after that day, continuing until today.</p>\n<p>Defying Coercion</p>\n<p>Then in mid-April, Australian Foreign Minister <person>Marise Payne</person> called for an independent review into the pandemic's origins including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing's</location> handling of the initial outbreak in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..wuhan\">Wuhan</location>. She quickly received backing from shadow foreign minister <person>Penny Wong</person> followed by support from Prime Minister <person>Scott Morrison</person> and others.</p>\n<p>The Chinese regime tried to discredit the request by accusing <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra</location> of politicizing the pandemic and warning that Chinese citizens may boycott <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> in various areas including beef, wine, tourism, and international students.</p>\n<p>When <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra</location> refused to back down, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location> banned beef imports from four major Australian producers and imposed 80 percent tariffs on Australian barley.</p>\n<p>Despite <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing's</location> disinformation and economic coercion, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra</location> remained firm, winning support from more than 120 countries for a co-sponsored motion seeking an independent evaluation of the global response to COVID-19 including the source of the virus and its route of transmission to humans. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">WHO</org> passed the motion at a virtual assembly on <chron>May 19</chron>.</p>\n<p>Deterring Foreign Interference and Spying</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia's</location> response to the CCP during the pandemic is consistent with its actions in recent years that clearly show its growing awareness of the urgency and necessity of resisting the threats posed by the communist regime.</p>\n<p>These threats are not limited to health and economic consequences, but also include significant political interference and espionage activities.</p>\n<p>In 2016, Prime Minister <person>Malcolm Turnbull</person> commissioned a report on the extent of foreign interference in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>. The classified report, which was leaked to the media in 2018, found that the CCP over the past decade had made attempts to influence Australian political parties and policy-making at every level of government.</p>\n<p>In response, Turnbull's government introduced legislation that banned foreign donations to political candidates, broadened the definition of espionage activities, and required all those working on behalf of foreign entities to publicly declare <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> they work for.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> was also one of the first countries to ban <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3467334626\">Huawei</org> from its 5G networks on national security grounds. In 2018, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra</location> blocked <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3467334626\">Huawei</org> from providing 5G technology to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, while barring <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"HongKong:0763\">ZTE</org>, another Chinese tech company, at the same time.</p>\n<p>The fundamental issue is one of trust between nations in cyberspace, wrote <person>Simeon Gilding</person>, a senior fellow at the <org>Australian Strategic Policy Institute</org> (ASPI), in a commentary in January.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, the <org>Chinese Communist Party</org> has destroyed that trust through its scaled and indiscriminate hacking of foreign networks and its determination to direct and control Chinese tech companies, said Gilding, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> until <chron>December 2019</chron> was head of the <org>Australian Signals Directorate's</org> signals intelligence and offensive cyber missions.</p>\n<p>Due to concerns about cyberattacks originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> had already excluded <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3467334626\">Huawei</org> from bidding on a project to build out the country's national broadband network back in 2012.</p>\n<p>'Seek Wider Trade Options,' 'Look to Real Friends'</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra's</location> vigilance combined with informed and timely action against the CCP could well be the most significant factor contributing to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia's</location> muchbetter-than-expected pandemic outcome thus far. It also attests to the kind of sound <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> policy and direction that will likely continue to serve the country well in the critical times ahead.</p>\n<p>In this context, there is bipartisan backing and broad public support for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra's</location> decisions including its <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3467334626\">Huawei</org> ban and its leadership in pushing for a global inquiry into the pandemic. And <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing's</location> overt use of coercion and disinformation has damaged its own image and helped to alert Australians to the serious threat that it poses.</p>\n<p>Managing relations with an assertive <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> requires Australian patience, consistency and steadfastness on policy over the long term, wrote <person>Richard Maude</person>, executive director of policy at the Asia Society Australia, in an article in May. Maude is also a former Australian deputy secretary of foreign affairs and trade.</p>\n<p>The task is harder because <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> increasingly is conducting its diplomacy in a manner it would never accept from others. That diminishes <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> but is the nature of authoritarian power.</p>\n<p>Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, an analyst at ASPI, wrote in an opinion piece that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> must not bow to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> but seek wider trade options and look to our real friends.</p>\n<p>In her article, published by the <org>Sydney Morning Herald</org> on <chron>May 21</chron>, Xu advised forming a strong alliance with like-minded nations and thinking long-term in reducing reliance on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> to better allow <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> to overcome <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing's</location> tactics.</p>\n<p>Upholding Values, Strengthened by Faith</p>\n<p>A survey by Newgate Australia conducted in the third week of May shows that 79 percent of Australians believe the country is responding to the pandemic at an appropriate level and that 67 percent believe the government is doing a good or excellent job. Despite concerns about the economy and jobs, Australians continue to have strong faith in the performance and actions of government, the survey found.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia's</location> prime minister, in turn, has strong spiritual faith. In a video published in March on the website <org>Eternity News</org>, Morrison says a prayer for his country and people, as well as his government colleagues. He prayed for God to give us strength in this country, give us wisdom, give us judgment, give us encouragement, and let your peace reign.</p>\n<p>Morrison has also declared that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> would never trade away our values and would deal with other countries fairly and honestly and openly, The Guardian reported in May.</p>\n<p>We have always been independent ... and we will always stand our ground when it comes to the things that we believe in and the values that we uphold, he said.</p>\n<p>The author of this article is a Chinese contributor using a pen name to protect their identity. As Chinese contributors and staffmembers of The Epoch Times and their relatives have been harassed, imprisoned, and disappeared in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, we protect their identities when necessary to avoid further persecution by the Chinese communist regime.</p>",
