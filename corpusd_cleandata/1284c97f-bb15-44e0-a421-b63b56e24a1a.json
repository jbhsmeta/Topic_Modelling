    "text": "As the world girds for ? long fight against COVID19 and North Carolinians\nshelter in their homes, advocates for survivors of sexual assault say they\nhave seen an increase in calls for help.\n\nProtocols at hospitals and other medical facilities have changed, upending how\nadvocacy organizations help victims even in the best of times.\n\nAs hospitals face their biggest challenge in a century, advocates also worry\nthat victims will not seek help out of fear of being exposed to the new\ncoronavirus, which causes COVID-19. \"1 wouldn't say that any of our services\nat Inter Act have ceased, however we have changed the way many services are\nprovided,\" said Lauren Schwartz, director of sexual assault services at\nInterAct in Wake County. The nonprofit serves victims of domestic violence and\nsexual assault.\n\nCarolina Public Press sought comment from several hospital systems around\nNorth Carolina on how they plan to help victims during the pandemic. All that\nresponded said they will continue to serve sexual assault victims. To prevent\nthe spread of COVID-19, some processes will change, however.\n\n\"Although some hospitals have changed the protocol during this time that\ndoesn't allow advocates in the hospital, we have adapted to providing virtual\nor telephone support to the survivor,\" said Monika Johnson HostLer, executive\ndirector of the N.C. Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\n\nIt's been less than two months since COVID-19 became a household term, but\nwhile many aspects of people s lives have drastically changed, the need for\nevidence preservation after an attack will remain. \"We believe sexual assault\nis happening,\" Johnson Hostler said. I believe the more vulnerable populations\nare going to be children and older people, which we saw during (Hurricane)\nKatrina and any other disaster.\n\nThough there are at times critical shortages of personal protective equipment\nfor hospital workers, hospitals say they will still serve victims of sexual\nassault. A hospital might direct a victim to another area of the hospital or\nanother building to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. And advocates\nwho would be there in person to hold the victim's hand and walk them through\nthe examination and evidence collection process will be there via telephone or\nvideo instead.\n\n\"We ve instituted a webchat feature on our site that allows survivors to reach\nus silently and anonymously in addition to our 24/7 crisis lines,\" Schwartz\nsaid. We also offer virtual case management and follow-ups so that our\nsurvivors can have a face-to-face interaction with our staff, and we re\ngetting ready to implement virtual support groups.\"\n\nAfter a sexual assault, the clock is ticking. The victim s body, now a crime\nscene, must be screened, scraped and swabbed; cataloged, labeled and sealed\naway. The very evidence that prosecutors need and juries often demand at trial\nis at stake.\n\nCliff Mehrtens, a spokesman for Charlotte-based Novant Health, said in an\nemail last month that several of Novant s hospitals will continue to provide\naccess to sexual assault nurse examiners, or SANE nurses. All greater\nCharlotte market hospitals will continue to perform SANE exams during the\npandemic,\" he said. We are following all appropriate COVID-19 precautions and\nwill continue to care for and support victims of sexual assault through this\ncrisis.\n\nThose who go to UNC hospitals will be screened for COVID-19 before being taken\nto a separate area of the hospital to prevent infections, Jennifer Sollami,\nclinical manager of the emergency department at UNC Rex Healthcare in Raleigh,\nand Dr. Karen Serrano, the medical director of the SANE program at UNC Medical\nCenter in Chapel Hill, said in a joint statement.\n\nHospitals around the nation are also restricting visitors. While victims may\nnot have in-person support, advocacy organizations are planning for video\nchats and follow-up care.\n\nLast month, Attorney General Josh Stein urged hospitals to maintain their\nsupport for SANE nurses through the duration of the pandemic.\n\n\"While many of us shelter in place to preserve safety, we must also consider\nthose among us who are less safe at home, Stein said.\n\nServices for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes\nmust remain available, including sexual assault nurse examiners. During the\nCOVID-19 crisis, my message to victims mains the same: We > about what\nhappened to you, and we will work tc achieve justice on your behalf.",

    "html": "<p>As the world girds for ? long fight against COVID19 and North Carolinians shelter in their homes, advocates for survivors of sexual assault say they have seen an increase in calls for help.</p>\n<p>Protocols at hospitals and other medical facilities have changed, upending how advocacy organizations help victims even in the best of times.</p>\n<p>As hospitals face their biggest challenge in a century, advocates also worry that victims will not seek help out of fear of being exposed to the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. \"1 wouldn't say that any of our services at Inter Act have ceased, however we have changed the way many services are provided,\" said <person>Lauren Schwartz</person>, director of sexual assault services at InterAct in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.wake\">Wake County</location>. The nonprofit serves victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p>\n<p><org>Carolina Public Press</org> sought comment from several hospital systems around <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location> on how they plan to help victims during the pandemic. All that responded said they will continue to serve sexual assault victims. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, some processes will change, however.</p>\n<p>\"Although some hospitals have changed the protocol during this time that doesn't allow advocates in the hospital, we have adapted to providing virtual or telephone support to the survivor,\" said <person>Monika Johnson HostLer</person>, executive director of the N.C. Coalition Against Sexual Assault.</p>\n<p>It's been less than two months since COVID-19 became a household term, but while many aspects of people s lives have drastically changed, the need for evidence preservation after an attack will remain. \"We believe sexual assault is happening,\" <person>Johnson Hostler</person> said. I believe the more vulnerable populations are going to be children and older people, which we saw during (Hurricane) Katrina and any other disaster.</p>\n<p>Though there are at times critical shortages of personal protective equipment for hospital workers, hospitals say they will still serve victims of sexual assault. A hospital might direct a victim to another area of the hospital or another building to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. And advocates who would be there in person to hold the victim's hand and walk them through the examination and evidence collection process will be there via telephone or video instead.</p>\n<p>\"We ve instituted a webchat feature on our site that allows survivors to reach us silently and anonymously in addition to our 24/7 crisis lines,\" Schwartz said. We also offer virtual case management and follow-ups so that our survivors can have a face-to-face interaction with our staff, and we re getting ready to implement virtual support groups.\"</p>\n<p>After a sexual assault, the clock is ticking. The victim s body, now a crime scene, must be screened, scraped and swabbed; cataloged, labeled and sealed away. The very evidence that prosecutors need and juries often demand at trial is at stake.</p>\n<p><person>Cliff Mehrtens</person>, a spokesman for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.charlt\">Charlotte</location>-based <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1495424946\">Novant Health</org>, said in an email last month that several of Novant s hospitals will continue to provide access to sexual assault nurse examiners, or SANE nurses. All greater <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.charlt\">Charlotte</location> market hospitals will continue to perform SANE exams during the pandemic,\" he said. We are following all appropriate COVID-19 precautions and will continue to care for and support victims of sexual assault through this crisis.</p>\n<p>Those who go to UNC hospitals will be screened for COVID-19 before being taken to a separate area of the hospital to prevent infections, <person>Jennifer Sollami</person>, clinical manager of the emergency department at <org>UNC Rex Healthcare</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.raleig\">Raleigh</location>, and Dr. <person>Karen Serrano</person>, the medical director of the SANE program at <org>UNC Medical Center</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.chaill\">Chapel Hill</location>, said in a joint statement.</p>\n<p>Hospitals around the nation are also restricting visitors. While victims may not have in-person support, advocacy organizations are planning for video chats and follow-up care.</p>\n<p>Last month, Attorney General <person>Josh Stein</person> urged hospitals to maintain their support for SANE nurses through the duration of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\"While many of us shelter in place to preserve safety, we must also consider those among us who are less safe at home, Stein said.</p>\n<p>Services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes must remain available, including sexual assault nurse examiners. During the COVID-19 crisis, my message to victims mains the same: We &gt; about what happened to you, and we will work tc achieve justice on your behalf.</p>",
