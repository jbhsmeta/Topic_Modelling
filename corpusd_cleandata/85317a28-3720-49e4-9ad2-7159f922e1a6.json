    "text": "Youngjin Yoo has been studying the digitalization of physical products and\nservices for many years. Success will not be as simple as making products\nsmart and connected or enabling a service digitally through apps and webs; it\nwill require deep \"digital first\" design. In this interview, Yoo discusses the\nDigital First framework he has created and how it can be applied. He also\nobserves that physical product companies have real advantages as the providers\nof what consumers actually consume.\n\nJim Euchner [JE]: You've created a number of useful digital value creation\nframeworks, including the Digital First framework. I'd like to start by\ndiscussing your thoughts on using these frameworks for driving digital value\nfor physical product companies.\n\nYoungjin Yoo [YY]: When the management scholarly community first started\ntalking about the importance of digital assets and digital innovations, it\nunleashed the concept of digital innovation that focused on the use of digital\nassets. Given the generative and dynamic nature of digital technology, people\nbegan using the term \"digital innovation\" in different ways, and its meaning\nwasn't always clear. The early studies on digital innovation often focused on\npure digital products--on users who engage with computers or smartphones to\nuse online search, digital media, or social media. These products enjoy all\nthe nice properties of digital assets, such as zero marginal cost of\nproduction and non-rivalry of consumption. As it is often said, the pure\ndigital world can look as if it is \"frictionless.\"\n\nBut now digital technology is becoming part of all products and services--not\njust in the pure digital online world but in the real physical world as well--\nand there is a fundamental shift in how we should think about digital\ninnovation. What I came to realize was that we've been completely missing the\nimportance--even the necessity--of the physicality of digital innovation. That\ninsight gave me an opportunity to pivot; when everyone else was talking about\nthe digital side of digital innovation, I felt we needed to think more about\nthe physical aspects of digital innovation and the importance of physical\nassets in the process. At the end of the day, it's not a pure digital\nexperience that really matters because most companies cannot create and\ncapture value unless their offering is consumed by users, and in many cases,\nthat consumption requires some conversion of digital information into a\nphysical manifestation.\n\nThat realization became crystal clear to me when I started talking to\ncompanies like Goodyear, Ikon, Timken, and LG. To some degree these companies\nfeel disadvantaged, and they often focus on what they don't think they have to\ndigitally innovate--but this is deficiency-oriented thinking. By focusing on\nwhat they do not have, they neglect what they already do have. The early\ngeneration of Silicon Valley companies, like Google and Facebook, never had to\nleave the digital space to create and capture value. The second generation of\ncompanies, such as Uber and Amazon, are successful cases of crossing the\nboundary between digital and physical. As these companies, and others like\nAirbnb and now WeWork, come from the digital space to the physical space, they\nare starting to realize how hard it is. A third generation will be those\nindustrial companies that embrace Digital First. Amazon's acquisition of Whole\nFoods is a specific example of the difficulty of moving from the digital to\nthe physical space. Amazon was probably hoping to fully integrate its Whole\nFoods corporation into its Amazon operation, but the company hasn't been able\nto do that yet. Amazon and Whole Foods remain, by and large, separate\nentities. All we get as consumers, for example, is a small discount for Amazon\nPrime members at Whole Foods; there is no deep connection. This example shows\nthe challenge that companies face in converting digital insight into physical\nconsumption. And that, I think, is where the opportunity lies.\n\nThe advantage an industrial company has is that it owns physical touchpoints--\na customer base, a physical sales channel, physical products, and so on. Not\nevery one of these assets will become strategic leverage points, but some of\nthem can be quite useful. The question is how to leverage the physical assets\nand combine them with digital capabilities to create new value in a way that\nwe could not do in the past. That's the initial starting point for the Digital\nFirst argument.\n\nThe real battleground in the coming decade will be in this Digital First\nspace. Traditional companies always think about the physical first, and when\nthey move to digital, they think about digital as secondary. Digital native\ncompanies, on the other hand, started as digital-only companies, but they are\nnow thinking about moving into physical space. Many still downplay the\nchallenges as they seek to deploy digital assets in the physical space. They\nwould like to believe that they can make physicality go away or at least\npretend as if it does not exist.\n\nUnfortunately, in the physical world that we live in, we have things like the\nlaw of gravity. There are frictions in this world; things have weights and\nheights; they occupy real space. An app might behave the same way after a\nmillion uses, but an Uber driver will become really tired after 10 hours of\ndriving. I think native digital companies are beginning to understand just how\ndifficult it is to move things and people in accordance with what their\nalgorithms dictate. I believe that physical companies need to become Digital\nFirst, but they need to come at it from a different angle than the digital\nnatives are.\n\nIt's interesting to watch the dynamics as this unfolds. Digital native\ncompanies are rapidly acquiring physical assets and physical companies are\nrapidly acquiring digital assets. In a way, it's a foot race to see who will\nfigure out how these two things work best together. I don't think there is\nanyone who has completely gotten it right. The Digital First framework we have\ndeveloped tries to help physical companies to think through what it is that\nthey need to do to succeed digitally. That's the motivation for the framework.\n\nJE: It seems like a lot of physical companies see digital as an add-on: adding\nintelligence to an existing product or adding a digital experience or an app\nto a physical product. Your work has taken the view that the physical product\nshould be thought of from a digital point of view at the point of conception.\nThe design of a product needs to change in a way that makes it possible for\nits consumption to be fundamentally different. Digital First products are\n\"generative\" because they evolve and spark engagement, not just use.\n\nYY: There are a couple of things that I would like to emphasize. The first is\nwhat I have termed \"deferred binding,\" which is what enables products to be\ngenerative. Manufacturing such products is different from the traditional\nmanufacturing process. Traditionally, when you produce a physical product,\nwhat the product does and how it does it is determined by the designers at the\npoint of design and is fixed throughout the manufacturing process, right up\nthrough the buying point. Users are not part of the ecosystem at all. The\nvalue creation chain ends when you sell the product. You must capture all the\nvalue at the point of sale.\n\nWith this traditional value chain model, there is no way of knowing what\npeople actually do once they have the product. The idea of deferred binding is\nthat we can digitally gain insights into what users want and need at or near\nthe point of use, then we can digitally design an offering to meet the\nperceived needs, and finally physically mobilize resources to meet that\nparticular need. And, this is not a one-time event--rather, it is an ongoing\nand recurring engagement. At the high level, that's what the Digital First\nframework is about.\n\nMany products will still need to be manufactured and distributed. But instead\nof the sale being the end point, with one-time value creation and capture, the\nsale should be seen as the beginning of an ongoing and recurring value-\ncreation relationship with the users. The issues are: Who will have better\ninsights on user needs? Who will be able to generate better services to meet\nthe perceived needs? Who will be able to physically meet the needs? Answering\nthese questions will require critical strategic capabilities that firms will\nneed to have to implement their Digital First strategy. Some of the\ncapabilities might come from me as a manufacturer, and some of them might come\nfrom other people. Some of them might be digital, and some of them might be\nphysical but, as the designer and manufacturer, I take the role of determining\nwhat combination of these things are necessary to meet your needs as a\ncustomer, and then I give them to you. At a very high level, that's what\ndeferred binding is.\n\nJE: Your framework helps firms that develop physical products to think about\nhow to make their companies digital. In my experience, although physical\nproduct companies have a strong sense at a high level that they need to become\ndigital, they are not sure how to do so. You have created a four-part\nframework that considers design through the lenses of time, place, artifacts,\nand the people who are using them. The user experience is at the center of\nthat framework.\n\nYou also talk in terms of the offline/online (or the physical/ digital)\nexperience and the backstage and frontstage (the user experience and what's\nnecessary to deliver it). I think it's a powerful design tool. Your framework\nwould change the way design is practiced. It builds on, but goes beyond, the\ntraditional \"understand customer needs and fill them\" framework.\n\nYY: In the Digital First framework, users take actions in the context of\nparticular configurations of time, space, artifacts, and people, and the\nconsequence of those actions shape experiences. Those experiences determine\nthe value created. The computational tools, such as the Internet of Things\n(IoT), mobile/wearable, predictive analytics, and generative algorithms, are\nreally about how the different actors create or shape our experience by\ndigitally mediating that experience in time, space, tools, and with other\npeople. It's really not much different from what we do when we map out a\ncustomer's journey map. However, manufacturing companies often use journey\nmaps in a very limited way, to understand how someone purchases their product\nand how the purchase journey ends, for example.\n\nWhat I want to do is to go beyond this--to digitally engage with users in an\nongoing way. A company needs to understand the user experience deeply and\ndynamically, and then it can decide how it can be part of shaping users'\nactivities and experiences over time. You want to understand what people do\nbefore and after specific events. The computed experience should be seen as a\nseries of snapshots of a computed experience diagram. When this is done, the\nusers' experiences can be understood as a series of unfolding events across\ntime and space that users engage within physical time and space constraints,\npartially mediated through digital tools. The experiences, in turn, produce\ndigital trace data. Given this, each company needs to think about its way of\nshaping a particular experience. If the users value the experience through use\nof a product, they're more likely to pay a premium or switch from a competitor\nto the company's experience.\n\nThe journey map for Digital First products should not represent just a one-\ntime journey, but an ongoing and recurring set of events. It allows you to\nthink differently about ways to create and capture value (Figure 1).\n\nJE: Can you give an example? What would the process be to get to the point\nwhere you achieved the ideal of having the experience of the product situated\nin both time and place?\n\nYY: Let's take an example from the world of music. In a movie there is always\na soundtrack that makes the scene more compelling and dramatic. But in my\nnormal life, there's nothing like that. To compensate, we often create our own\n\"soundtrack\" with earphones and headsets, voices of family and friends, and\nTVs and music players. What if there were a company that curated soundtracks\nfor your life? They would create a layer of experience that depended on time,\nspace, artifacts, and people. Throughout the day, all that company would think\nabout would be creating the best listening experience for you. From the moment\nyou wake up until the moment you go to bed, all day long, it would curate your\nsound experience.\n\nIt wouldn't matter what medium you were using to listen with, or whether you\nwere in the bathroom, the shower, the car, in your office, or using your\nAirPods--it would know exactly what you would be likely to listen to, and\nwould then curate and deliver the content to you, wherever you were. Spotify\nprobably comes closest to this, but I don't think that it quite delivers\nbecause the company doesn't really think through the physical space of the\nauditory experience.\n\nThink about the moments in your life. When I wake up, I am in bed; then I go\nand run; then I take a shower; and then I drive to work. Is it possible that\nSpotify could know the context of my activity at each point and what I liked\nto listen to for every single activity? I want to listen to bird noises when I\nwake up; I want to listen to music when I shower; I want to listen to\ndifferent music when I run; I want to listen to NPR when I drive; and I want\nto talk to my wife when we have breakfast together. Why can't somebody curate\nthat in an interesting way so that I don't have to do anything, so that my\nlife is like a movie soundtrack all the time?\n\nIs it possible? I think so. I'm looking for a startup who would declare, \"We\nare the sound engineers of your life.\" Nothing in this vision is\nprefabricated; there is no CD, no channel; it's dynamic, it's ongoing, and\nit's curated. That is an experiential product from a sound perspective.\n\nA company that creates such a platform needs a way of enveloping these\nactivities--like a semi-marketplace--and then it needs to let third-party\ncomplementors compete with each other within that platform. The users will not\nhave to go to other places to find these providers; the platform will have a\ncollection of complementors that they think would be useful for you, and you\nwill choose from that.\n\nDigital platform companies will be very different from the traditional\nhierarchical companies, which offer one product or serve one market. These\ndigital platform companies will make products and services that are highly\ncontingent upon your needs, using algorithms to determine those needs\ndepending on context and third-party complementors to deliver them. This is\nwhere I think the world is going.\n\nJE: That's the best description I've heard of what a digital platform for a\nphysical company might actually be. There are so many people talking about\nplatforms, and I think they are struggling to convey just how to think about\nthem.\n\nIn your work, you talk about the difference between products, which require\nearly binding, and platforms, which enable deferred binding. You also talk\nabout closed versus open systems, and the potential of opening up a platform.\nThe platform is designed to enable the full, context-dependent experience, and\nit brings in partners where necessary to make the experience happen. Am I\naccurately reflecting the model?\n\nYY: Absolutely. So what is a platform? A platform is a semi-market. It is a\nmarket in that there are multiple complementors that are competing for your\nattention. It is a semi-market because it requires the physical platform to\nexist. Apple's ecosystem requires Apple's product; it does not exist without\niOS and Apple's hardware products. Second, it is a semi-market because it is\n100 percent open. The firm that owns the platform sets the rules.\n\nNow why does this matter? Users always combine multiple products and services\nto create their own value. But if a platform company can understand the full\nuser experience in an area, the full breadth of activities that users\nparticipate in, and the resources that they use to do so, it can create--and\ncapture--a lot more value.\n\nSome time ago Oliver Hart received a Nobel Prize for a very simple insight:\nyou cannot capture value without ownership of property. When Nike sells shoes,\nfor example, it loses ownership of the property (the shoes). All the value\nthat the user creates by using the property is captured by the user. This\nvalue is often larger than the value Nike could ever think about capturing as\na product company. That is why users buy products. The price we pay, and the\nvalue Nike captures, must be smaller than the value we generate by using their\nproducts. Users bring additional resources to create value in that process.\n\nNow imagine that Nike treated its product as a platform with its own digital\nresources, and that the company continued to have at least partial ownership\nof the digital resources after the sale. If Nike were able to use digital\nresources to understand how users wanted to create value, and if it could help\nusers fulfill their needs by providing useful complementers, the company would\nhave a legitimate reason to capture value either from the users or\ncomplementors. The transaction would not be just about the shoes; it would\ninclude fashion and sports competitions and social factors. Each of these is a\nplace where more value might be created in context.\n\nBut before now companies have never had the visibility to understand what\npeople actually do, and they have had no way of mobilizing the necessary\nresources to help them. As a result, product companies have relinquished\nownership of the assets through a product sale, so they have left everything\nelse on the table; they have captured a tiny fraction of the value created.\nWith digital platforms, firms do not have to do that anymore, so firms with\ndigital platforms will be much more valuable.\n\nIn many ways, this is not any different from traditional B2B companies that\nhave turned to system-solution selling. The B2C companies tell their\ncustomers, \"I have a solution for you for your process or your function; you\njust pay me X, and I will bring together a whole bunch of business partners\nwho will sell you the components of the services you need as part of the total\nsolution.\" If companies do this right, customers are willing to pay for it.\n\nThe idea underlying platforms is that, as a product company, you create semi-\nmarkets within which you retain certain ownership of the digital assets that\nunderpin the platform. Then you bring together the players that you think will\nadd value for the users, and you orchestrate them for the users according to\ntheir particular needs at a particular time and place. The users can choose\nwhich parts they want to consume, and the final product will be different for\ndifferent users--that's what we mean by deferred binding. Note that it's not\nthe product itself that undergoes deferred binding; it's the orchestration of\nthe experience of using the product--the co-creation of value--that is being\ndeferred.\n\nIf your digital platform ecosystem becomes too big, however, and there are too\nmany complementors, the platform will need to reduce the complexity of the\nchoice. This is why I believe that companies will move in the direction of\ncurating these \"playlists\" of activities for end users, without the users\nthemselves having to directly choose from all the complementors. A Spotify\nplaylist is a very prescient service offering. Think about the difference\nbetween the old iTunes and Spotify. With iPod and iTunes, you download music\n(from music labels as complementors), and you build playlists. With Spotify,\nplaylists are already built, and Spotify keeps recommending playlists you\nshould play depending on the context. This will be a model that many will have\nto follow, because users are essentially lazy; if a platform can make a choice\nthat I believe that I might like better than the one I would make myself, I\nwill be willing to pay for it. The bundle of carefully curated activities\ntogether with necessary complementary resources will produce an experience\nsuperior to simple use of the product.\n\nIn many ways this is an evolution of the idea of markets. Companies create\nvalue by identifying and meeting needs in the marketplace. The mass production\nmodel sees only one need in a single market and needs only one type of\nresponse to fulfill it. The market segmentation model breaks the market down\ninto sub-segments, and manufacturers create the capacity to respond to more\ndiverse needs for these segments. Personalization means that each customer is\nits own market.\n\nBut this is not the end game. Companies like Amazon want to know you better\nthan you know yourself. They want to evolve their model of you as you change.\nYour needs in the morning are different than your needs in the evening, so I\ncannot even treat you as a single market; personalization is no longer enough.\nYou yourself are multiple markets, and I need to be able to mobilize my\nresources accordingly. To do this, whether a company is digital or not, it\nneeds two capabilities--a sensing capability and a responding capability.\n\nThe point that I'm making with Digital First is that when you digitize these\ntwo capabilities--your ability to sense precisely and in a timely way, and\nyour ability to mobilize resources--you are going to be better than companies\nthat don't. You can do this by using your product as a baseline from which to\nbuild a platform, because you have that asset. For example, Samsung has TV\nunits in more households in the United States than anyone else. Why can't\nSamsung use that? They know when somebody is watching TV and they need to ask\nother questions: What else does this person do when they watch TV? What is the\njourney around TV watching experiences that we as a consumer want to mobilize?\nThese questions open up something bigger than the idea of a Smart TV. What is\nimportant is what is happening in the living room during the watching of TV\nthat allows Samsung to co-create value as part of that experience. Maybe the\ncomplementors are chicken and beer while you're watching a football game, for\nexample, not some feature of the TV itself.\n\nJE: In your model you talk about the digital value loop. Each experience is\npart of a loop. You have also observed that there are five design choices that\nare important: creating a loop, the velocity of the loop, the veracity of the\nloop, the depth of the loop, and the granularity of the loop. Can you talk\nabout these design choices?\n\nYY: A digital value loop is essentially a company's ability to sense the\ncontingency in the world and respond to it. Many companies have not created\nany loops, at all. They may get a delayed sensing of the environment since,\nonce they sell a product, they get a market response through sales numbers.\nThey may also have once-a-year focus groups, for example, but these are\nreally, really delayed loops.\n\nA connected product offers you the ability to monitor the actual use in close\nto real time. This creates a loop, which is essential, but the velocity of the\nloop depends on your ability to respond to the signal. If feedback is received\non a daily basis versus a weekly or monthly basis, that creates a very\ndifferent basis for an organization to respond to the data.\n\nThe veracity of the loop is also important. Veracity refers to the reality of\nwhat users are doing and care about in the loop. Computer sensors are not real\nhuman beings; they are just seeing the stream of data coming in, and an\nalgorithm is inferring what is happening in the real world. But how do we\nunderstand if a data stream coming in from users is actually the real data\nstream that is reflective of a certain activity? An example might help. When\nthe Pokemon Go game came out, it was connected with a pedometer to encourage\nkids to walk, but my son just shook the pedometer. The pedometer didn't know\nwhether my son was actually walking or just shaking it. That's a veracity\nissue. Facebook has veracity problem in its loop because it is cost-free for\npeople to lie; Amazon doesn't, because ordering products just to confuse\nAmazon's algorithms costs money.\n\nDepth and breadth refer to how deeply you go with your analysis of the loop.\nDo you consider just music, or also other kinds of sound experiences? Do you\ninclude news, for example? Phone conversations? There are different depths\nthat might be considered. Breadth refers to the different modalities of\nexperience. In the imaginary digital soundtrack service that I talked about\nearlier, the breadth refers to the media, like audio, visual, and physical\nmedia. There are different dimensionalities of experiences we can mediate with\ndifferent media. The media could include sounds related to entertainment,\nnews, or work.\n\nGranularity refers to how pinpointed the information is. The system might\nunderstand the sound decibel level of my entire house, or a room in the house,\nor within my body reach. Think of Airbnb. You use Airbnb because you need a\nhouse, a home, a kitchen, a dining table. If I want to host a party, I may not\nneed a whole house; I just need a dining room with a dining table. Can Airbnb\nsense and respond to users' needs at that resolution? The goal is to sense\nwhat the customer really needs and then to match that with the precise\nresources required, minimizing waste.\n\nJE: You talk about both sensing and responding. For responding, you have used\nthe metaphor of printing. Obviously, printing isn't just printing a document\nor a thing--it is a broader concept in your meaning of the term. Can you talk\nabout what you mean by printing as it ties in with co-creation at the point of\nuse?\n\nYY: Printing in my way of thinking is a conversion of digital insights into an\nactual physical manifestation of some kind to create value to users in the\nphysical world. Once Spotify has insight about what you like to listen to, for\nexample, that insight needs to be translated into actual music. The printing\nis done when the beats hit the airwave. The whole idea is the materialization\nof computed insights into a physical rendering of some form, something which\nis of value to users and that they can actually consume. To me, that's\nprinting.\n\nThis notion of printing is related to the concept of procrastinated binding.\nPrinting used to be done massively at the point of manufacturing. It was at\nmanufacturing that all the insight from market research was converted into\ndesign and became a physical product. Value was captured when the product was\nsold. That was the end of the journey, and the producer didn't see or capture\nany of the value created during use. In the Digital First view, there is still\na product, but the value capture is not only at the point of purchase, but\nalso during use throughout the life of the product. The printing is delayed or\nprocrastinated. And it is recurring. The printing involves mobilizing the\ndifferent resources that are needed to create value in use for the customers.\nBy necessity, it involves not only my product but also the products or\nservices of other parties. The coordination and mobilization of the different\nparties and resources are done through algorithms, and they are done in run-\ntime. As a manufacturer I want to be the one who coordinates the mobilization\nof those resources. I don't want to leave it to the user, because then I will\nnot participate in creating value in use, and I won't have the right to\ncapture any of the value. I also don't want to cede this role to other parties\nbecause they will be in the position to capture most of the value. I'd rather\nbe the one who coordinates the experience, and I want to earn that role\nbecause I have better insight about customer needs.\n\nJE: One more question. How should Digital First thinking affect what leaders\nof R&D or product development in physical product companies do? How should\nthey think about their roles going forward?\n\nYY: I think that the idea of traditional R&D needs to change. People need to\nget out of their labs and go into users' houses, because if they really want\nto do this Digital First transformation, the value is created at the point of\nuse. How can you create a platform without seeing and understanding that\naction? The point of value creation is no longer at your factory; the point of\nvalue creation is at the point of consumption and use. As an R&D leader, you\nhad better be there; you had better really understand what can be done beyond\nthe product to deliver the experience. That is the most important, big thing\nR&D leaders need to do.\n\nThe IoT can be viewed as many different things, but from an R&D perspective, I\nlook at IoT and connected products not only as a delivery platform but also as\nan R&D partner. If we are able to get rich data and feed it into analytical\nengines to sense what users like to do and generate possible digital solutions\nusing generative algorithms, I think that we will discover a tremendous\nopportunity for IoT to create very different and much better consumption\nexperiences. This is the big advantage that physical product companies will\nhave in the next generation of digital.\n\nJim Euchner is editor-in-chief of Research-Technology Management and Honorary\nProfessor at Aston University (UK).

    "title": "Digital First Thinking for Industrial Companies: An Interview with Youngjin Yoo: Youngjin Yoo talks with Jim Euchner about digital value creation for physical products and the Digital First framework.(CONVERSATIONS)(Interview)",
    "html": "<p><person>Youngjin Yoo</person> has been studying the digitalization of physical\nproducts and services for many years. Success will not be as simple as\nmaking products smart and connected or enabling a service digitally\nthrough apps and webs; it will require deep \"digital first\"\ndesign. In this interview, Yoo discusses the Digital First framework he\nhas created and how it can be applied. He also observes that physical\nproduct companies have real advantages as the providers of what\nconsumers actually consume.</p>\n\n<p>Jim Euchner [JE]: You've created a number of useful digital\nvalue creation frameworks, including the Digital First framework.\nI'd like to start by discussing your thoughts on using these\nframeworks for driving digital value for physical product companies.</p>\n\n<p>Youngjin Yoo [YY]: When the management scholarly community first\nstarted talking about the importance of digital assets and digital\ninnovations, it unleashed the concept of digital innovation that focused\non the use of digital assets. Given the generative and dynamic nature of\ndigital technology, people began using the term \"digital\ninnovation\" in different ways, and its meaning wasn't always\nclear. The early studies on digital innovation often focused on pure\ndigital products--on users who engage with computers or smartphones to\nuse online search, digital media, or social media. These products enjoy\nall the nice properties of digital assets, such as zero marginal cost of\nproduction and non-rivalry of consumption. As it is often said, the pure\ndigital world can look as if it is \"frictionless.\"</p>\n\n<p>But now digital technology is becoming part of all products and\nservices--not just in the pure digital online world but in the real\nphysical world as well--and there is a fundamental shift in how we\nshould think about digital innovation. What I came to realize was that\nwe've been completely missing the importance--even the\nnecessity--of the physicality of digital innovation. That insight gave\nme an opportunity to pivot; when everyone else was talking about the\ndigital side of digital innovation, I felt we needed to think more about\nthe physical aspects of digital innovation and the importance of\nphysical assets in the process. At the end of the day, it's not a\npure digital experience that really matters because most companies\ncannot create and capture value unless their offering is consumed by\nusers, and in many cases, that consumption requires some conversion of\ndigital information into a physical manifestation.</p>\n\n<p>That realization became crystal clear to me when I started talking\nto companies like <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:GT\">Goodyear</org>, Ikon, Timken, and LG. To some degree these\ncompanies feel disadvantaged, and they often focus on what they\ndon't think they have to digitally innovate--but this is\ndeficiency-oriented thinking. By focusing on what they do not have, they\nneglect what they already do have. The early generation of <location>Silicon\nValley</location> companies, like Google and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org>, never had to leave the\ndigital space to create and capture value. The second generation of\ncompanies, such as <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:UBER\">Uber</org> and Amazon, are successful cases of crossing the\nboundary between digital and physical. As these companies, and others\nlike Airbnb and now <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3219219571\">WeWork</org>, come from the digital space to the physical\nspace, they are starting to realize how hard it is. A third generation\nwill be those industrial companies that embrace Digital First.\nAmazon's acquisition of <org>Whole Foods</org> is a specific example of the\ndifficulty of moving from the digital to the physical space. Amazon was\nprobably hoping to fully integrate its <org>Whole Foods</org> corporation into its\nAmazon operation, but the company hasn't been able to do that yet.\nAmazon and <org>Whole Foods</org> remain, by and large, separate entities. All we\nget as consumers, for example, is a small discount for Amazon Prime\nmembers at <org>Whole Foods</org>; there is no deep connection. This example shows\nthe challenge that companies face in converting digital insight into\nphysical consumption. And that, I think, is where the opportunity lies.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage an industrial company has is that it owns physical\ntouchpoints--a customer base, a physical sales channel, physical\nproducts, and so on. Not every one of these assets will become strategic\nleverage points, but some of them can be quite useful. The question is\nhow to leverage the physical assets and combine them with digital\ncapabilities to create new value in a way that we could not do in the\npast. That's the initial starting point for the Digital First\nargument.</p>\n\n<p>The real battleground in the coming decade will be in this Digital\nFirst space. Traditional companies always think about the physical\nfirst, and when they move to digital, they think about digital as\nsecondary. Digital native companies, on the other hand, started as\ndigital-only companies, but they are now thinking about moving into\nphysical space. Many still downplay the challenges as they seek to\ndeploy digital assets in the physical space. They would like to believe\nthat they can make physicality go away or at least pretend as if it does\nnot exist.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in the physical world that we live in, we have\nthings like the law of gravity. There are frictions in this world;\nthings have weights and heights; they occupy real space. An app might\nbehave the same way after a million uses, but an <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:UBER\">Uber</org> driver will become\nreally tired after 10 hours of driving. I think native digital companies\nare beginning to understand just how difficult it is to move things and\npeople in accordance with what their algorithms dictate. I believe that\nphysical companies need to become Digital First, but they need to come\nat it from a different angle than the digital natives are.</p>\n\n<p>It's interesting to watch the dynamics as this unfolds.\nDigital native companies are rapidly acquiring physical assets and\nphysical companies are rapidly acquiring digital assets. In a way,\nit's a foot race to see who will figure out how these two things\nwork best together. I don't think there is anyone who has\ncompletely gotten it right. The Digital First framework we have\ndeveloped tries to help physical companies to think through what it is\nthat they need to do to succeed digitally. That's the motivation\nfor the framework.</p>\n\n<p>JE: It seems like a lot of physical companies see digital as an\nadd-on: adding intelligence to an existing product or adding a digital\nexperience or an app to a physical product. Your work has taken the view\nthat the physical product should be thought of from a digital point of\nview at the point of conception. The design of a product needs to change\nin a way that makes it possible for its consumption to be fundamentally\ndifferent. Digital First products are \"generative\" because\nthey evolve and spark engagement, not just use.</p>\n\n<p>YY: There are a couple of things that I would like to emphasize.\nThe first is what I have termed \"deferred binding,\" which is\nwhat enables products to be generative. Manufacturing such products is\ndifferent from the traditional manufacturing process. Traditionally,\nwhen you produce a physical product, what the product does and how it\ndoes it is determined by the designers at the point of design and is\nfixed throughout the manufacturing process, right up through the buying\npoint. Users are not part of the ecosystem at all. The value creation\nchain ends when you sell the product. You must capture all the value at\nthe point of sale.</p>\n\n<p>With this traditional value chain model, there is no way of knowing\nwhat people actually do once they have the product. The idea of deferred\nbinding is that we can digitally gain insights into what users want and\nneed at or near the point of use, then we can digitally design an\noffering to meet the perceived needs, and finally physically mobilize\nresources to meet that particular need. And, this is not a one-time\nevent--rather, it is an ongoing and recurring engagement. At the high\nlevel, that's what the Digital First framework is about.</p>\n\n<p>Many products will still need to be manufactured and distributed.\nBut instead of the sale being the end point, with one-time value\ncreation and capture, the sale should be seen as the beginning of an\nongoing and recurring value-creation relationship with the users. The\nissues are: Who will have better insights on user needs? Who will be\nable to generate better services to meet the perceived needs? Who will\nbe able to physically meet the needs? Answering these questions will\nrequire critical strategic capabilities that firms will need to have to\nimplement their Digital First strategy. Some of the capabilities might\ncome from me as a manufacturer, and some of them might come from other\npeople. Some of them might be digital, and some of them might be\nphysical but, as the designer and manufacturer, I take the role of\ndetermining what combination of these things are necessary to meet your\nneeds as a customer, and then I give them to you. At a very high level,\nthat's what deferred binding is.</p>\n\n<p>JE: Your framework helps firms that develop physical products to\nthink about how to make their companies digital. In my experience,\nalthough physical product companies have a strong sense at a high level\nthat they need to become digital, they are not sure how to do so. You\nhave created a four-part framework that considers design through the\nlenses of time, place, artifacts, and the people who are using them. The\nuser experience is at the center of that framework.</p>\n\n<p>You also talk in terms of the offline/online (or the physical/\ndigital) experience and the backstage and frontstage (the user\nexperience and what's necessary to deliver it). I think it's a\npowerful design tool. Your framework would change the way design is\npracticed. It builds on, but goes beyond, the traditional\n\"understand customer needs and fill them\" framework.</p>\n\n<p>YY: In the Digital First framework, users take actions in the\ncontext of particular configurations of time, space, artifacts, and\npeople, and the consequence of those actions shape experiences. Those\nexperiences determine the value created. The computational tools, such\nas the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile/wearable, predictive analytics,\nand generative algorithms, are really about how the different actors\ncreate or shape our experience by digitally mediating that experience in\ntime, space, tools, and with other people. It's really not much\ndifferent from what we do when we map out a customer's journey map.\nHowever, manufacturing companies often use journey maps in a very\nlimited way, to understand how someone purchases their product and how\nthe purchase journey ends, for example.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do is to go beyond this--to digitally engage with\nusers in an ongoing way. A company needs to understand the user\nexperience deeply and dynamically, and then it can decide how it can be\npart of shaping users' activities and experiences over time. You\nwant to understand what people do before and after specific events. The\ncomputed experience should be seen as a series of snapshots of a\ncomputed experience diagram. When this is done, the users'\nexperiences can be understood as a series of unfolding events across\ntime and space that users engage within physical time and space\nconstraints, partially mediated through digital tools. The experiences,\nin turn, produce digital trace data. Given this, each company needs to\nthink about its way of shaping a particular experience. If the users\nvalue the experience through use of a product, they're more likely\nto pay a premium or switch from a competitor to the company's\nexperience.</p>\n\n<p>The journey map for Digital First products should not represent\njust a one-time journey, but an ongoing and recurring set of events. It\nallows you to think differently about ways to create and capture value\n(Figure 1).</p>\n\n<p>JE: Can you give an example? What would the process be to get to\nthe point where you achieved the ideal of having the experience of the\nproduct situated in both time and place?</p>\n\n<p>YY: Let's take an example from the world of music. In a movie\nthere is always a soundtrack that makes the scene more compelling and\ndramatic. But in my normal life, there's nothing like that. To\ncompensate, we often create our own \"soundtrack\" with\nearphones and headsets, voices of family and friends, and TVs and music\nplayers. What if there were a company that curated soundtracks for your\nlife? They would create a layer of experience that depended on time,\nspace, artifacts, and people. Throughout the day, all that company would\nthink about would be creating the best listening experience for you.\nFrom the moment you wake up until the moment you go to bed, all day\nlong, it would curate your sound experience.</p>\n\n<p>It wouldn't matter what medium you were using to listen with,\nor whether you were in the bathroom, the shower, the car, in your\noffice, or using your AirPods--it would know exactly what you would be\nlikely to listen to, and would then curate and deliver the content to\nyou, wherever you were. Spotify probably comes closest to this, but I\ndon't think that it quite delivers because the company doesn't\nreally think through the physical space of the auditory experience.</p>\n\n<p>Think about the moments in your life. When I wake up, I am in bed;\nthen I go and run; then I take a shower; and then I drive to work. Is it\npossible that Spotify could know the context of my activity at each\npoint and what I liked to listen to for every single activity? I want to\nlisten to bird noises when I wake up; I want to listen to music when I\nshower; I want to listen to different music when I run; I want to listen\nto <org>NPR</org> when I drive; and I want to talk to my wife when we have\nbreakfast together. Why can't somebody curate that in an\ninteresting way so that I don't have to do anything, so that my\nlife is like a movie soundtrack all the time?</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible? I think so. I'm looking for a startup who\nwould declare, \"We are the sound engineers of your life.\"\nNothing in this vision is prefabricated; there is no CD, no channel;\nit's dynamic, it's ongoing, and it's curated. That is an\nexperiential product from a sound perspective.</p>\n\n<p>A company that creates such a platform needs a way of enveloping\nthese activities--like a semi-marketplace--and then it needs to let\nthird-party complementors compete with each other within that platform.\nThe users will not have to go to other places to find these providers;\nthe platform will have a collection of complementors that they think\nwould be useful for you, and you will choose from that.</p>\n\n<p>Digital platform companies will be very different from the\ntraditional hierarchical companies, which offer one product or serve one\nmarket. These digital platform companies will make products and services\nthat are highly contingent upon your needs, using algorithms to\ndetermine those needs depending on context and third-party complementors\nto deliver them. This is where I think the world is going.</p>\n\n<p>JE: That's the best description I've heard of what a\ndigital platform for a physical company might actually be. There are so\nmany people talking about platforms, and I think they are struggling to\nconvey just how to think about them.</p>\n\n<p>In your work, you talk about the difference between products, which\nrequire early binding, and platforms, which enable deferred binding. You\nalso talk about closed versus open systems, and the potential of opening\nup a platform. The platform is designed to enable the full,\ncontext-dependent experience, and it brings in partners where necessary\nto make the experience happen. Am I accurately reflecting the model?</p>\n\n<p>YY: Absolutely. So what is a platform? A platform is a semi-market.\nIt is a market in that there are multiple complementors that are\ncompeting for your attention. It is a semi-market because it requires\nthe physical platform to exist. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:AAPL\">Apple</org>'s ecosystem requires\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:AAPL\">Apple</org>'s product; it does not exist without iOS and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:AAPL\">Apple</org>'s\nhardware products. Second, it is a semi-market because it is 100 percent\nopen. The firm that owns the platform sets the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Now why does this matter? Users always combine multiple products\nand services to create their own value. But if a platform company can\nunderstand the full user experience in an area, the full breadth of\nactivities that users participate in, and the resources that they use to\ndo so, it can create--and capture--a lot more value.</p>\n\n<p>Some time ago <person>Oliver Hart</person> received a Nobel Prize for a very simple\ninsight: you cannot capture value without ownership of property. When\nNike sells shoes, for example, it loses ownership of the property (the\nshoes). All the value that the user creates by using the property is\ncaptured by the user. This value is often larger than the value Nike\ncould ever think about capturing as a product company. That is why users\nbuy products. The price we pay, and the value Nike captures, must be\nsmaller than the value we generate by using their products. Users bring\nadditional resources to create value in that process.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that Nike treated its product as a platform with its\nown digital resources, and that the company continued to have at least\npartial ownership of the digital resources after the sale. If Nike were\nable to use digital resources to understand how users wanted to create\nvalue, and if it could help users fulfill their needs by providing\nuseful complementers, the company would have a legitimate reason to\ncapture value either from the users or complementors. The transaction\nwould not be just about the shoes; it would include fashion and sports\ncompetitions and social factors. Each of these is a place where more\nvalue might be created in context.</p>\n\n<p>But before now companies have never had the visibility to\nunderstand what people actually do, and they have had no way of\nmobilizing the necessary resources to help them. As a result, product\ncompanies have relinquished ownership of the assets through a product\nsale, so they have left everything else on the table; they have captured\na tiny fraction of the value created. With digital platforms, firms do\nnot have to do that anymore, so firms with digital platforms will be\nmuch more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, this is not any different from traditional B2B\ncompanies that have turned to system-solution selling. The B2C companies\ntell their customers, \"I have a solution for you for your process\nor your function; you just pay me X, and I will bring together a whole\nbunch of business partners who will sell you the components of the\nservices you need as part of the total solution.\" If companies do\nthis right, customers are willing to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>The idea underlying platforms is that, as a product company, you\ncreate semi-markets within which you retain certain ownership of the\ndigital assets that underpin the platform. Then you bring together the\nplayers that you think will add value for the users, and you orchestrate\nthem for the users according to their particular needs at a particular\ntime and place. The users can choose which parts they want to consume,\nand the final product will be different for different users--that's\nwhat we mean by deferred binding. Note that it's not the product\nitself that undergoes deferred binding; it's the orchestration of\nthe experience of using the product--the co-creation of value--that is\nbeing deferred.</p>\n\n<p>If your digital platform ecosystem becomes too big, however, and\nthere are too many complementors, the platform will need to reduce the\ncomplexity of the choice. This is why I believe that companies will move\nin the direction of curating these \"playlists\" of activities\nfor end users, without the users themselves having to directly choose\nfrom all the complementors. A Spotify playlist is a very prescient\nservice offering. Think about the difference between the old iTunes and\nSpotify. With iPod and iTunes, you download music (from music labels as\ncomplementors), and you build playlists. With Spotify, playlists are\nalready built, and Spotify keeps recommending playlists you should play\ndepending on the context. This will be a model that many will have to\nfollow, because users are essentially lazy; if a platform can make a\nchoice that I believe that I might like better than the one I would make\nmyself, I will be willing to pay for it. The bundle of carefully curated\nactivities together with necessary complementary resources will produce\nan experience superior to simple use of the product.</p>\n\n<p>In many ways this is an evolution of the idea of markets. Companies\ncreate value by identifying and meeting needs in the marketplace. The\nmass production model sees only one need in a single market and needs\nonly one type of response to fulfill it. The market segmentation model\nbreaks the market down into sub-segments, and manufacturers create the\ncapacity to respond to more diverse needs for these segments.\nPersonalization means that each customer is its own market.</p>\n\n<p>But this is not the end game. Companies like Amazon want to know\nyou better than you know yourself. They want to evolve their model of\nyou as you change. Your needs in the morning are different than your\nneeds in the evening, so I cannot even treat you as a single market;\npersonalization is no longer enough. You yourself are multiple markets,\nand I need to be able to mobilize my resources accordingly. To do this,\nwhether a company is digital or not, it needs two capabilities--a\nsensing capability and a responding capability.</p>\n\n<p>The point that I'm making with Digital First is that when you\ndigitize these two capabilities--your ability to sense precisely and in\na timely way, and your ability to mobilize resources--you are going to\nbe better than companies that don't. You can do this by using your\nproduct as a baseline from which to build a platform, because you have\nthat asset. For example, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Korea:005930\">Samsung</org> has TV units in more households in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the\nUnited States</location> than anyone else. Why can't <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Korea:005930\">Samsung</org> use that? They\nknow when somebody is watching TV and they need to ask other questions:\nWhat else does this person do when they watch TV? What is the journey\naround TV watching experiences that we as a consumer want to mobilize?\nThese questions open up something bigger than the idea of a Smart TV.\nWhat is important is what is happening in the living room during the\nwatching of TV that allows <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Korea:005930\">Samsung</org> to co-create value as part of that\nexperience. Maybe the complementors are chicken and beer while\nyou're watching a football game, for example, not some feature of\nthe TV itself.</p>\n\n<p>JE: In your model you talk about the digital value loop. Each\nexperience is part of a loop. You have also observed that there are five\ndesign choices that are important: creating a loop, the velocity of the\nloop, the veracity of the loop, the depth of the loop, and the\ngranularity of the loop. Can you talk about these design choices?</p>\n\n<p>YY: A digital value loop is essentially a company's ability to\nsense the contingency in the world and respond to it. Many companies\nhave not created any loops, at all. They may get a delayed sensing of\nthe environment since, once they sell a product, they get a market\nresponse through sales numbers. They may also have once-a-year focus\ngroups, for example, but these are really, really delayed loops.</p>\n\n<p>A connected product offers you the ability to monitor the actual\nuse in close to real time. This creates a loop, which is essential, but\nthe velocity of the loop depends on your ability to respond to the\nsignal. If feedback is received on a daily basis versus a weekly or\nmonthly basis, that creates a very different basis for an organization\nto respond to the data.</p>\n\n<p>The veracity of the loop is also important. Veracity refers to the\nreality of what users are doing and care about in the loop. Computer\nsensors are not real human beings; they are just seeing the stream of\ndata coming in, and an algorithm is inferring what is happening in the\nreal world. But how do we understand if a data stream coming in from\nusers is actually the real data stream that is reflective of a certain\nactivity? An example might help. When the Pokemon Go game came out, it\nwas connected with a pedometer to encourage kids to walk, but my son\njust shook the pedometer. The pedometer didn't know whether my son\nwas actually walking or just shaking it. That's a veracity issue.\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org> has veracity problem in its loop because it is cost-free for\npeople to lie; Amazon doesn't, because ordering products just to\nconfuse Amazon's algorithms costs money.</p>\n\n<p>Depth and breadth refer to how deeply you go with your analysis of\nthe loop. Do you consider just music, or also other kinds of sound\nexperiences? Do you include news, for example? Phone conversations?\nThere are different depths that might be considered. Breadth refers to\nthe different modalities of experience. In the imaginary digital\nsoundtrack service that I talked about earlier, the breadth refers to\nthe media, like audio, visual, and physical media. There are different\ndimensionalities of experiences we can mediate with different media. The\nmedia could include sounds related to entertainment, news, or work.</p>\n\n<p>Granularity refers to how pinpointed the information is. The system\nmight understand the sound decibel level of my entire house, or a room\nin the house, or within my body reach. Think of Airbnb. You use Airbnb\nbecause you need a house, a home, a kitchen, a dining table. If I want\nto host a party, I may not need a whole house; I just need a dining room\nwith a dining table. Can Airbnb sense and respond to users' needs\nat that resolution? The goal is to sense what the customer really needs\nand then to match that with the precise resources required, minimizing\nwaste.</p>\n\n<p>JE: You talk about both sensing and responding. For responding, you\nhave used the metaphor of printing. Obviously, printing isn't just\nprinting a document or a thing--it is a broader concept in your meaning\nof the term. Can you talk about what you mean by printing as it ties in\nwith co-creation at the point of use?</p>\n\n<p>YY: Printing in my way of thinking is a conversion of digital\ninsights into an actual physical manifestation of some kind to create\nvalue to users in the physical world. Once Spotify has insight about\nwhat you like to listen to, for example, that insight needs to be\ntranslated into actual music. The printing is done when the beats hit\nthe airwave. The whole idea is the materialization of computed insights\ninto a physical rendering of some form, something which is of value to\nusers and that they can actually consume. To me, that's printing.</p>\n\n<p>This notion of printing is related to the concept of procrastinated\nbinding. Printing used to be done massively at the point of\nmanufacturing. It was at manufacturing that all the insight from market\nresearch was converted into design and became a physical product. Value\nwas captured when the product was sold. That was the end of the journey,\nand the producer didn't see or capture any of the value created\nduring use. In the Digital First view, there is still a product, but the\nvalue capture is not only at the point of purchase, but also during use\nthroughout the life of the product. The printing is delayed or\nprocrastinated. And it is recurring. The printing involves mobilizing\nthe different resources that are needed to create value in use for the\ncustomers. By necessity, it involves not only my product but also the\nproducts or services of other parties. The coordination and mobilization\nof the different parties and resources are done through algorithms, and\nthey are done in run-time. As a manufacturer I want to be the one who\ncoordinates the mobilization of those resources. I don't want to\nleave it to the user, because then I will not participate in creating\nvalue in use, and I won't have the right to capture any of the\nvalue. I also don't want to cede this role to other parties because\nthey will be in the position to capture most of the value. I'd\nrather be the one who coordinates the experience, and I want to earn\nthat role because I have better insight about customer needs.</p>\n\n<p>JE: One more question. How should Digital First thinking affect\nwhat leaders of R&amp;D or product development in physical product\ncompanies do? How should they think about their roles going forward?</p>\n\n<p>YY: I think that the idea of traditional R&amp;D needs to change.\nPeople need to get out of their labs and go into users' houses,\nbecause if they really want to do this Digital First transformation, the\nvalue is created at the point of use. How can you create a platform\nwithout seeing and understanding that action? The point of value\ncreation is no longer at your factory; the point of value creation is at\nthe point of consumption and use. As an R&amp;D leader, you had better\nbe there; you had better really understand what can be done beyond the\nproduct to deliver the experience. That is the most important, big thing\nR&amp;D leaders need to do.</p>\n\n<p>The IoT can be viewed as many different things, but from an R&amp;D\nperspective, I look at IoT and connected products not only as a delivery\nplatform but also as an R&amp;D partner. If we are able to get rich data\nand feed it into analytical engines to sense what users like to do and\ngenerate possible digital solutions using generative algorithms, I think\nthat we will discover a tremendous opportunity for IoT to create very\ndifferent and much better consumption experiences. This is the big\nadvantage that physical product companies will have in the next\ngeneration of digital.</p>\n\n<p><person>Jim Euchner</person> is editor-in-chief of Research-Technology Management\nand Honorary Professor at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2946523354\">Aston University</org> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>).
