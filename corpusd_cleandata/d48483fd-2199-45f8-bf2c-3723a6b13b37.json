    "text": "One Welsh county has seen a dramatically lower number of coronavirus cases and\ndeaths than most others.\n\nCeredigion has recorded 42 confirmed cases and seven deaths.\n\nWhile its initial figures were similar to other rural parts of the country,\nthe number of cases did not follow the same pattern that others did.\n\nThe man behind the county's strategy said he believed in 'pursuing the disease\nrather than following it'.\n\nAnd nowhere else in Wales or the rest of the UK has had fewer cases.\n\nHow it differs from the rest of the UK:\n\nOne of the possible reasons for the small number of cases could be that the\narea is a largely rural county, with a much lower population compared to\nregions like Cardiff.\n\nAcross the world, cities with denser populations were hit first and hardest by\nthe virus.\n\nBut Ceredigion still compares favourably to other rural areas.\n\nThe latest data from Public Health Wales shows Powys had 216 cases for every\n100,000 people in the area, Pembrokeshire 279, and Gwynedd 449.\n\nBut Ceredigion has had just 57 per 100,000.\n\nWales Online reported that data from the ONS shows that there have been hardly\nany excess deaths in the Hywel Dda health board area.\n\nThe spike in the south and south-east of Wales simply doesn't show up here.\nAnd Ceredigion has been the area of Hywel Dda with the least Covid-19.\n\nWhile this may lead some to believe that infection never spread to the area,\nthe data shows that the initial spread was identical to Pemrokshire's.\n\nWhy is it different?\n\nOne of the key differences is how Ceredigion responded to the virus. Before\nthe region had its first case, it had set up a \"homemade\" in house test track\nand trace system.\n\nThe system was created by Barry Rees, the corporate director for Ceredigion\nCouncil, who is a scientist by training believes contact tracing is \"pursuing\nthe disease rather than following it.\"\n\nAnother reason could be down to their 'gold command' meeting, which was held\nbefore their first fatality.\n\nIn the meeting, key people in the council, including leader Ellen ap Gwynn and\nMr Rees, they needed to decide what to do.\n\nThis included how to stop the population doubling. Thousands of students were\nprevented from coming to Aberystwyth University, one of the first universities\nto close, and before the national lockdown came into play.\n\nAlong with preventing holidaymakers attend the area, helped to keep the area\ndown to its \"core population\".\n\nMr Rees,51, explained: \"I piped up about having read about contact tracing in\nsouth-east Asia where they had trialed it, and we were able to put the\nmanpower in to do it,\n\n\"I knew we had the skillset and so I got a couple of colleagues together who\ncreated something, based on research which was happening internationally.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing complex - just a simple questionnaire which could be\nfilled in manually, as a way of contact tracing.\n\n\"That's the way it has developed really, probably helped by our lower\nnumbers.\"\n\nThe system allowed the council to trace every confirmed case in the county\nover recent weeks.\n\nMr Rees is keen to stress he is \"just the ideas person\" who \"facilitates the\nwork\".\n\nHe adds: \"The doing has been done by other people.\"\n\nHe believes active contact tracing is a race against time which is why his\nsystem took a conservative approach and assumed every symptomatic person was\nto be a positive case.\n\n\"Numbers started off pretty low, and there was one busy weekend where we had a\ncouple of positive tests we needed to follow up,\" explained Mr Rees.\n\n\"We also had some symptomatic members of staff, and we really needed to snuff\nthat out and pursue that.\n\n\"They've subsequently been tested, and that test was negative, but we did some\npreventative stuff, prior to the test. One of the worries is that, if the\nstarting point for the contact tracing is a positive test, you're already some\nway down the line.\n\n\"If people aren't following the advice being given, then you're missing a few\ndays for people to go through the further process of being tested. You might\nbe losing 48 hours where these people may not be following the guidance and\npotentially spreading the virus.\n\n\"We short-circuited that loop and didn't wait for their test results to come\nback before taking action. We were able to send a note down to our contact\ntracing team to gather more information. If they're showing symptoms, then\nthere's almost the presumption of a positive test and that guides the advice\nwe give to them.\"\n\nNow the Welsh Government has launched its own track and trace system across\nWales, which is still in the early stages.\n\nBut Mr Rees warns: \"You've got to be careful what you wish for because\nsuddenly we could swamp the whole system and the system could fail because of\nthe numbers involved,\n\n\"In an ideal world we'd have the capacity to catch people when they're\nsymptomatic, do some contact tracing and advise them on their behaviours and\nthat would be able to really get hold of it. We'd be really pursuing the\ndisease then rather than following it then.\"\n\nMr Rees is wary about putting Ceredigion \"on a pedestal\" for \"doing anything\nbetter than anybody else\".\n\n\"We're pretty pleased with the low numbers, but I certainly wouldn't want\nanything to suggest we're complacent about it or that we're doing anything\nbetter than anybody else,\"",

    "title": "How one Welsh county protected itself from coronavirus - by hunting it down",
    "html": "<p>One Welsh county has seen a dramatically lower number of coronavirus cases and deaths than most others.</p>\n<p>Ceredigion has recorded 42 confirmed cases and seven deaths.</p>\n\n<p>While its initial figures were similar to other rural parts of the country, the number of cases did not follow the same pattern that others did.</p>\n\n<p>The man behind the county's strategy said he believed in 'pursuing the disease rather than following it'.</p>\n\n<p>And nowhere else in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.wal\">Wales</location> or the rest of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> has had fewer cases.</p>\n\n<p>How it differs from the rest of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>:</p>\n\n<p>One of the possible reasons for the small number of cases could be that the area is a largely rural county, with a much lower population compared to regions like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.wal.cardif\">Cardiff</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Across the world, cities with denser populations were hit first and hardest by the virus.</p>\n\n<p>But Ceredigion still compares favourably to other rural areas.</p>\n\n<p>The latest data from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3597422570\">Public Health Wales</org> shows <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.wal.powys\">Powys</location> had 216 cases for every 100,000 people in the area, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.wal.pembro\">Pembrokeshire</location> 279, and Gwynedd 449.</p>\n\n<p>But Ceredigion has had just 57 per 100,000.</p>\n\n<p>Wales Online reported that data from the ONS shows that there have been hardly any excess deaths in the Hywel Dda health board area.</p>\n\n<p>The spike in the south and south-east of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.wal\">Wales</location> simply doesn't show up here. And Ceredigion has been the area of Hywel Dda with the least Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p>While this may lead some to believe that infection never spread to the area, the data shows that the initial spread was identical to Pemrokshire's.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it different?</p>\n\n<p>One of the key differences is how Ceredigion responded to the virus. Before the region had its first case, it had set up a \"homemade\" in house test track and trace system.</p>\n\n<p>The system was created by <person>Barry Rees</person>, the corporate director for <org>Ceredigion Council</org>, who is a scientist by training believes contact tracing is \"pursuing the disease rather than following it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another reason could be down to their 'gold command' meeting, which was held before their first fatality.</p>\n\n<p>In the meeting, key people in the council, including leader Ellen ap Gwynn and <person>Mr Rees</person>, they needed to decide what to do.</p>\n\n<p>This included how to stop the population doubling. Thousands of students were prevented from coming to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2833996049\">Aberystwyth University</org>, one of the first universities to close, and before the national lockdown came into play.</p>\n\n<p>Along with preventing holidaymakers attend the area, helped to keep the area down to its \"core population\".</p>\n\n<p>Mr Rees,51, explained: \"I piped up about having read about contact tracing in south-east <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</location> where they had trialed it, and we were able to put the manpower in to do it,</p>\n\n<p>\"I knew we had the skillset and so I got a couple of colleagues together who created something, based on research which was happening internationally.</p>\n\n<p>\"At first, it was nothing complex - just a simple questionnaire which could be filled in manually, as a way of contact tracing.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's the way it has developed really, probably helped by our lower numbers.\"</p>\n\n<p>The system allowed the council to trace every confirmed case in the county over recent weeks.</p>\n\n<p><person>Mr Rees</person> is keen to stress he is \"just the ideas person\" who \"facilitates the work\".</p>\n\n<p>He adds: \"The doing has been done by other people.\"</p>\n\n<p>He believes active contact tracing is a race against time which is why his system took a conservative approach and assumed every symptomatic person was to be a positive case.</p>\n\n<p>\"Numbers started off pretty low, and there was one busy weekend where we had a couple of positive tests we needed to follow up,\" explained <person>Mr Rees</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"We also had some symptomatic members of staff, and we really needed to snuff that out and pursue that.</p>\n\n<p>\"They've subsequently been tested, and that test was negative, but we did some preventative stuff, prior to the test. One of the worries is that, if the starting point for the contact tracing is a positive test, you're already some way down the line.</p>\n\n<p>\"If people aren't following the advice being given, then you're missing a few days for people to go through the further process of being tested. You might be losing 48 hours where these people may not be following the guidance and potentially spreading the virus.</p>\n\n<p>\"We short-circuited that loop and didn't wait for their test results to come back before taking action. We were able to send a note down to our contact tracing team to gather more information. If they're showing symptoms, then there's almost the presumption of a positive test and that guides the advice we give to them.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0211790783\">Welsh Government</org> has launched its own track and trace system across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.wal\">Wales</location>, which is still in the early stages.</p>\n\n<p>But <person>Mr Rees</person> warns: \"You've got to be careful what you wish for because suddenly we could swamp the whole system and the system could fail because of the numbers involved,</p>\n\n<p>\"In an ideal world we'd have the capacity to catch people when they're symptomatic, do some contact tracing and advise them on their behaviours and that would be able to really get hold of it. We'd be really pursuing the disease then rather than following it then.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Mr Rees</person> is wary about putting Ceredigion \"on a pedestal\" for \"doing anything better than anybody else\".</p>\n\n<p>\"We're pretty pleased with the low numbers, but I certainly wouldn't want anything to suggest we're complacent about it or that we're doing anything better than anybody else,\"</p>",
