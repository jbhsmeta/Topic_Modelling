There is no indication of a new Vice\nChancellor being appointed any time soon,\" he said.He said the University had\na number of vacancies -- 60% teachers posts and 50% non-teaching posts were\nlying vacant. \"The earlier VCs too did not take any action to fix these\nissues,\" he charged.Mr. lagiri said the Governor had the right to appoint a\nVice Chancellor to the University and he should immediately make an\nappointment.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.\nNowlready have an account ?Sign inStart your 14 days trial now.Sign Up\nBenefits IncludeFind mobile-friendly version of articles from the day's\nnewspaper in one easy-to-read list.Unlimited ccessEnjoy reading as many\narticles as you wish without any limitations.Personalised recommendations\nselect list of articles that match your interests and tastes.Faster pagesMove\nsmoothly between articles as our pages load instantly.Dashboard one-stop-shop\nfor seeing the latest updates, and managing your preferences.BriefingWe brief\nyou on the latest and most important developments, three times a day.Not\nconvinced?
