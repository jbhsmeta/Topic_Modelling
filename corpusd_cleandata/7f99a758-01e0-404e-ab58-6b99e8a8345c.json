I never intended to hurt them or shoot them. I just wanted them to leave.\"</p>\n\n<p>As he continued to yell at the group, more shots were fired into the air, and the crowd scattered.</p>\n\n<p>Neighbors said no one was hurt.</p>\n\n<p>\"I just thank God they didn't shoot me, and I thank God that none of them were shot,\" the man said. \"I just hope they learn from this and change their life.\"</p>\n\n<p>42.594829 -87.835664</p>",
