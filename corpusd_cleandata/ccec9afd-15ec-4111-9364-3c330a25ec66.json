    "text": "The past two weeks in the United States have been full of trauma, pain, and\nshame, revealing again deep-seated racism and profound policy deficiencies for\ncombatting it, and highlighting the catastrophic, immoral, dictatorial, and\nreprehensible policies of Donald Trump. The turmoil in the country and ways\nout, including lessons for police reform, are highly relevant for Mexico as\nwell.\n\nThe brutal police killing of George Floyd painfully shows that six years after\nthe killing of another African American Michael Brown by a police officer in\nFerguson Missouri, racism and excessive and inappropriate use of force by\npolice officers in the United States persists. Structural racism in our\ncountry persists in many ways. In Mexico, police abuse is even more widespread\nand does not escape from hatred toward minority groups. Indigenous Mexicans\noften suffer highly unequal treatment by Mexican police forces: allowing\nindigenous communities to self-police is an important, but insufficient step.\nIt does not stop abuse by Mexican police forces from outside.\n\nIn the United States, the awful situation was made worse by the President\nTrump's decision to unleash the National Guard and a highly violent police\nresponse against peaceful protests in sympathy with the Floyd family and\nagainst racism and police brutality. For no reason other than a frivolous and\ninappropriate photo-op, the President ordered that non-violent protestors be\ncleared out of his way so he could pose with a bible in front of St. John's\nChurch in Washington, DC. The president has disparaged the nonviolent\nprotestors as looters, urged governors to \"dominate\" the streets , and\nthreatened to use the U.S. military against the protestors . Instead of\nunifying the country, President Trump has made a mockery of justice and\ncompassion, acting like a wannabe dictator unrestrained by laws, morality, or\nempathy. This is hardly surprising from a man who has sought to provoke\nconfrontations and egged on far-right groups to engage in armed intimidation\nfrom Michigan to Virginia. What is shocking is how much the top leadership of\nthe Department of Justice, sworn to uphold U.S. laws and rule of law in the\ncountry (not to loyalty to the president) has failed to restrain Trump and has\ntried to justify his ill deeds.\n\nThe collapse of policing forces in Mexico has necessitated the troubled\ndeployment of the military, something even the administration of President\nAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) has not been able to escape, despite its\ncreation of the National Guard - a force strongly composed of the military.\nCrucially, however, all security forces acting at home must enforce rule of\nlaw with the least amount of necessary forces and without brutality and law\nviolations.\n\nPeaceful protests are essential for democracy and rule of law. So is making\nsure that peaceful protests stay peaceful, violence and looting are prevented,\nand perpetrators of violence get arrested -- but with the minimum necessary\nforce.\n\nThe past two weeks in the United States have also been a time of hope. People\nof all races, colors, and age groups have joined the peaceful protests. Young\npeople across the country have embraced ending racism as their responsibility\nand calling. Police officers across the country have \"taken a knee\" in support\nof the protests and the condemnation of police brutality. Police departments\nin the United States are substantially more multiethnic and racially diverse\nthan they used to be. Many police chiefs and police associations have\ncondemned the actions of the officers who tortured and killed Mr. Floyd. Three\nformer U.S. four-star generals - James Mattis, Mike Mullen, and John Allen -\nhave denounced President Trump's efforts to polarize our country, his resort\nto violence, and his abuse of executive power and disregard for the U.S.\nconstitution.\n\nIn Mexico, the U.S. events have also revived discussions of security forces\nbrutality - after local police officers in Jalisco state egregiously beat to\ndeath Giovanni Lopez for allegedly not wearing a face mask as bystanders\npleaded with the police to release him.\n\nIn the U.S. and Mexico, there is a crucial need for systemic and concrete\nchange throughout the justice and law enforcement system. That requires not\njust street activism but policy leadership commitment and improvements in\npolicies, procedures, and safeguards.\n\nA thoughtful younger colleague who has protested daily over the past week and\nwho was subjected to the Trump-ordered violence asked when it is OK for police\nand military officers to disobey an order. It is certainly legal and necessary\nfor police officers and soldiers to disobey an unlawful order, such as murder,\nincluding in war. However, by choosing to become police officers and soldiers,\nindividuals sign up for a necessary and fundamental willingness to obey orders\nthat are legal even though they consider them wrong. Thus, the police officers\ncannot simply choose not to enforce announced curfews or refuse to clear\nstreets of protestors. Rule of law requires enforcing laws. The challenge is\nto make laws and practices better. If officers, in the name of justice, refuse\nto carry out an order that is legal, what is to stop them from failing to\ncarry out legal orders against unjust causes and actions, such as intimidation\nby right-wing armed protestors storming a government building? Why would\nviolent actors not become emboldened? If police or military members decide\nthey cannot carry a lawful order, they must resign. The standard of compliance\nfor them is much higher than for the rest of the public.\n\nRather than asking our police officers to refuse to implement lawful, although\nbad, orders, the needed changes must include determined effort to teach human\nrights and respect for diversity in police academies; stamping out racism\nthere and in other institutions; scrupulous investigation of any killing by a\npolice officer, including by pulling the officer off duty until a thorough\ninvestigation has been carried out, and diligent prosecution of police\nofficers who commit murder or use force in excess of what is strictly\nrequired. The needed policies also include a thorough review of use-of-force\nguidelines by mayors, governors, and police chiefs and their publication for\npublic assessment and transparency. Such tools are highly appropriate in\nMexico too.\n\nMeaningful action can also be taken by those who do not have direct policy\ninfluence. A young friend of mine whose Mexican father died in prison because\na correction officer knelt on his neck, in almost the same way that killed Mr.\nFloyd, had launched a legal action that resulted in court-ordered improvements\nto police and corrections practices in her jurisdiction. Having committed\nherself to work on criminal justice, she now shared all of her caselaw with\nthe Floyd family's legal team. Along with two other students, she is creating\na national publicly-available database of police officers with a history of\nbrutality based on public records, newspaper articles, official press\nreleases, and legal pleadings. Similar databases and initiatives can be\nlaunched in Mexico.\n\nFinally, the rightful outrage against racism, bigotry, injustice, and abuse of\npower must be translated into voting out terrible leaders.",

    "title": "Hatred and police brutality in the U.S. and lessons for Mexico",
    "html": "<p>The past two weeks in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> have been full of trauma, pain, and shame, revealing again deep-seated racism and profound policy deficiencies for combatting it, and highlighting the catastrophic, immoral, dictatorial, and reprehensible policies of <person>Donald Trump</person>. The turmoil in the country and ways out, including lessons for police reform, are highly relevant for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> as well.</p>\n<p>The brutal police killing of <person>George Floyd</person> painfully shows that six years after the killing of another African American <person>Michael Brown</person> by a police officer in <person>Ferguson Missouri</person>, racism and excessive and inappropriate use of force by police officers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> persists. Structural racism in our country persists in many ways. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location>, police abuse is even more widespread and does not escape from hatred toward minority groups. Indigenous Mexicans often suffer highly unequal treatment by Mexican police forces: allowing indigenous communities to self-police is an important, but insufficient step. It does not stop abuse by Mexican police forces from outside.</p>\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, the awful situation was made worse by the President Trump&#8217;s decision to unleash the <org>National Guard</org> and a highly violent police response against peaceful protests in sympathy with the Floyd family and against racism and police brutality. For no reason other than a frivolous and inappropriate photo-op, the President ordered that non-violent protestors be cleared out of his way so he could pose with a bible in front of St. John&#8217;s Church in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, DC</location>. The president has disparaged the nonviolent protestors as looters, urged governors to &#8220;dominate&#8221; the streets , and threatened to use the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> military against the protestors . Instead of unifying the country, <person>President Trump</person> has made a mockery of justice and compassion, acting like a wannabe dictator unrestrained by laws, morality, or empathy. This is hardly surprising from a man who has sought to provoke confrontations and egged on far-right groups to engage in armed intimidation from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>. What is shocking is how much the top leadership of the <org>Department of Justice</org>, sworn to uphold <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> laws and rule of  law in the country (not to loyalty to the president) has failed to restrain Trump and has tried to justify his ill deeds.</p>\n<p>The collapse of policing forces in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> has necessitated the troubled deployment of the military, something even the administration of President Andr&#233;s Manuel Lop&#233;z Obrador (AMLO) has not been able to escape, despite its creation of the <org>National Guard</org> &#8211; a force strongly composed of the military. Crucially, however, all security forces acting at home must enforce rule of law with the least amount of necessary forces and without brutality and law violations.</p>\n<p>Peaceful protests are essential for democracy and rule of law. So is making sure that peaceful protests stay peaceful, violence and looting are prevented, and perpetrators of violence get arrested &#8212; but with the minimum necessary force.</p>\n<p>The past two weeks in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> have also been a time of hope. People of all races, colors, and age groups have joined the peaceful protests. Young people across the country have embraced ending racism as their responsibility and calling. Police officers across the country have &#8220;taken a knee&#8221; in support of the protests and the condemnation of police brutality. Police departments in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> are substantially more multiethnic and racially diverse than they used to be. Many police chiefs and police associations have condemned the actions of the officers who tortured and killed <person>Mr. Floyd</person>. Three former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> four-star generals &#8211; <person>James Mattis</person>, <person>Mike Mullen</person>, and <person>John Allen</person> &#8211; have denounced President Trump&#8217;s efforts to polarize our country, his resort to violence, and his abuse of executive power and disregard for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> constitution.</p>\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> events have also revived discussions of security forces brutality &#8211; after local police officers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/mx.jl\">Jalisco</location> state egregiously beat to death Giovanni L&#243;pez for allegedly not wearing a face mask as bystanders pleaded with the police to release him.</p>\n<p>In the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location>, there is a crucial need for systemic and concrete change throughout the justice and law enforcement system. That requires not just street activism but policy leadership commitment and improvements in policies, procedures, and safeguards.</p>\n<p>A thoughtful younger colleague who has protested daily over the past week and who was subjected to the Trump-ordered violence asked when it is OK for police and military officers to disobey an order. It is certainly legal and necessary for police officers and soldiers to disobey an unlawful order, such as murder, including in war. However, by choosing to become police officers and soldiers, individuals sign up for a necessary and fundamental willingness to obey orders that are legal even though they consider them wrong. Thus, the police officers cannot simply choose not to enforce announced curfews or refuse to clear streets of protestors. Rule of law requires enforcing laws. The challenge is to make laws and practices better. If officers, in the name of justice, refuse to carry out an order that is legal, what is to stop them from failing to carry out legal orders against unjust causes and actions, such as intimidation by right-wing armed protestors storming a government building? Why would violent actors not become emboldened? If police or military members decide they cannot carry a lawful order, they must resign. The standard of compliance for them is much higher than for the rest of the public.</p>\n<p>Rather than asking our police officers to refuse to implement lawful, although  bad,  orders, the needed changes must include determined effort to teach human rights and respect for diversity in police academies; stamping out racism there and in other institutions; scrupulous investigation of any killing by a police officer, including by pulling the officer off duty until a thorough investigation has been carried out, and diligent prosecution of police officers who commit murder or use force in excess of what is strictly required. The needed policies also include a thorough review of use-of-force guidelines by mayors, governors, and police chiefs and their publication for public assessment and transparency. Such tools are highly appropriate in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> too.</p>\n<p>Meaningful action can also be taken by those who do not have direct policy influence. A young friend of mine whose Mexican father died in prison because a correction officer knelt on his neck, in almost the same way that killed <person>Mr. Floyd</person>, had launched a legal action that resulted in court-ordered improvements to police and corrections practices in her jurisdiction. Having committed herself to work on criminal justice, she now shared all of her caselaw with the Floyd family&#8217;s legal team. Along with two other students, she is creating a national publicly-available database of police officers with a history of brutality based on public records, newspaper articles, official press releases, and legal pleadings. Similar databases and initiatives can be launched in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the rightful outrage against racism, bigotry, injustice, and abuse of power must be translated into voting out terrible leaders.</p>",
