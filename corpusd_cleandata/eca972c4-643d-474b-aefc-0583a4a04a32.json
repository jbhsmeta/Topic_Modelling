While it is important\nthat we restart economic activities and engage in recreational pursuits, it is\nequally important to remain vigilant about our health and to maintain social\ndistancing and hygiene practices. Be aware that certain activities and\nsettings are greater risk factors for infection with coronavirus:\n\nCrowded areas - Any setting in which there is a large gathering of people pose\na greater risk for transmission of coronavirus. This is because people are in\ncloser proximity to each other and may more easily transmit coronavirus if\nthey are infected. Many people who are infected show no symptoms and so they\nmay be out and about with others.

While it is important that we restart economic activities and engage in recreational pursuits, it is equally important to remain vigilant about our health and to maintain social distancing and hygiene practices. Be aware that certain activities and settings are greater risk factors for infection with coronavirus:</p>\n<p>Crowded areas - Any setting in which there is a large gathering of people pose a greater risk for transmission of coronavirus. This is because people are in closer proximity to each other and may more easily transmit coronavirus if they are infected. Many people who are infected show no symptoms and so they may be out and about with others. Always try to maintain at least 6 feet of distance from others, and if possible, avoid going into crowded areas.</p>",
