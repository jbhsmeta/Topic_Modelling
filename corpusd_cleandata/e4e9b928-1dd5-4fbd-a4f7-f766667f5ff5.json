    "text": "In nationwide demonstrations against the police killing of George Floyd and\nother black Americans, protesters are frequently pepper sprayed or enveloped\nin clouds of tear gas. These crowd-control weapons are rarely lethal, but in\nthe middle of the coronavirus pandemic, there are growing calls for police to\nstop using these chemical irritants, because they can damage the body in ways\nthat can spread the coronavirus and increase the severity of COVID-19.\n\nEven before the coronavirus pandemic, some experts said additional research\nwas needed on the risks of tear gas - an umbrella term for several chemical\n\"riot control agents\" used by law enforcement. It's known that the chemicals\ncan have both immediate and long-term health effects.\n\nTheir widespread use in recent weeks, while an infectious disease continues to\nspread across the U.S., has stunned experts and physicians. The coronavirus\nthat causes the disease COVID-19 is highly contagious, spreads easily through\nthe air via droplets, and can lead to severe or fatal respiratory illness.\nDeploying these corrosive, inhalable chemicals could harm people in several\nways: expose more people to the virus, compromise the body's ability to fight\noff the infection and even cause mild infections to become more severe\nillnesses.\n\n\"This is a recipe for disaster,\" says professor Sven Eric Jordt, a researcher\nat Duke University School of Medicine who studies the effects of tear gas.\n\nJordt refers to these chemicals as \"pain gases\" because they activate certain\npain-sensing nerves on the skin and in the mucus membranes of the eyes, mouth\nand nose.\n\n\"You have this excruciating pain, sneezing, coughing, the production of a lot\nof mucus that obstructs breathing,\" Jordt says.\n\nPeople describe a burning and stinging sensation, even a sense of asphyxiation\nand drowning. Sometimes it causes vomiting or allergic reactions.\n\nIn law enforcement, officers generally use two types of chemicals for crowd\ncontrol: CS gas and pepper spray.\n\nThe active ingredient in pepper spray, called capsaicin, is derived from\nchilis. It's often sprayed from cans at close quarters or lobbed into crowds\nin the form of \"pepper balls.\"\n\nCS gas (o\u2010chlorobenzylidene malononitrile) is a chlorinated, organic chemical\nthat can induce \"very strong inflammation\" and \"chemical injury\" by burning\nthe skin and airways when inhaled, Jordt says.\n\n\"Using it in the current situation with COVID-19 around is completely\nirresponsible,\" he adds. \"There are sufficient data proving that tear gas can\nincrease the susceptibility to pathogens, to viruses.\"\n\nJordt says research on the harms of tear gas has not kept up with its\nescalating use in the U.S and around the world in recent years. Many of the\nsafety studies that law enforcement officials rely on date back to the 1950s\nand 60s, he says.\n\nBut a 2014 study from the U.S Army offers an alarming glimpse into how the\nchemical could escalate the pandemic. The study found that recruits who were\nexposed to tear gas as part of a training exercise were more likely to get\nsick with respiratory illnesses like the common cold and the flu.\n\n\"We have a lot of antiviral defenses that can inactivate viruses and prevent\nthem from entering cells,\" he says. \"These are depleted by inhalation of tear\ngas and also compromised.\"\n\nThe findings of the Army study led the U.S military to significantly reduce\nhow much recruits were being exposed to the chemical.\n\n\"Even the army realized they had done something wrong and that this was more\ntoxic than they thought before,\" Jordt says.\n\nEven though there is a limited amount of research on this new coronavirus,\nthere are studies from China and Italy about how other irritants, such as\nsmoking and air pollution, affect COVID-19. These studies indicate that tear\ngas could also make people more likely to develop severe illness, says Dr.\nJohn Balmes, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Francisco\nand an expert with the American Thoracic Society\n\n\"I actually think we could be promoting COVID-19 by tear gassing protesters,\"\nsays Balmes. \"It causes injury and inflammation to the lining of the airways.\"\n\nBalmes says this period of inflammation sets back the body's defenses, and\nmakes it more likely that someone who already harbors the virus will become\nsick.\n\n\"It's adding fuel to the fire,\" says Balmes. \"These exposures to tear gas\nwould increase the risk of progression from the asymptomatic infection, to a\nsymptomatic disease.\"\n\nGrowing evidence shows many people who have the coronavirus are asymptomatic\nand don't know they are infected, or are \"presymptomatic\" - infected with the\nvirus and able to infect others, but not yet showing symptoms. With thousands\nof people jammed together at mass protests, the demonstrations are already\nprimed to be 'superspreading events,' which can lead to an explosion of new\ncases. Outdoor gatherings typically decrease the chance of spreading the\ncoronavirus. But activities like singing and yelling can increase the risk.\n\nTear gas and pepper spray can also sow confusion and panic in a crowd. People\nmay rip off their masks and touch their faces, leading to more contamination.\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, says the body's\nreaction to the chemicals cause people to shed more of the virus.\n\n\"If they're coughing, the particles actually emanate and are projectiles that\ntravel about six feet or so and could land on other people,\" says Adalja, who\nis also a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"This is a way to almost induce the virus to be expelled from people when they\nare exposed to these agents.\"\n\nAdalja anticipates the protests will inevitably lead to a spike in infections.\n\n\"We know that any kind of social unrest, especially in the midst of an\noutbreak, is only going to make things worse,\" he says.\n\nHe says the most recent example would be bombings in Yemen that are\nexacerbating a cholera outbreak.\n\nDr. Rohini Haar, an emergency physician in Oakland, Calif.,, has studied the\nuse of riot control agents around the world.\n\n\"These weapons don't actually deescalate tensions in peaceful community\npolicing,\" says Haar who is a lecturer at the University of California,\nBerkeley.\n\nHaar has also been treating COVID-19 patients. She recognizes there is a\ndanger of spreading the virus at these gatherings, but she would not\ndiscourage people from attending the protests and exercising their right to\nfree speech.\n\n\"It's a really tough situation,\" says Haar. \"I think the irony is that people\nare rightfully and justifiably protesting police violence and are being met\nwith violence that is worsening the pandemic conditions we're living under\nright now.\"\n\nThis week, more than a thousand physicians and health care professionals\nsigned an open letter in support of the demonstrations.\n\nDr. Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease expert at the University of\nChicago, is one of them.\n\nShe says it will be difficult to determine whether any spike in cases were a\ndirect result of the protests, because they're happening at a time when many\nstates are also allowing businesses to reopen.\n\n\"In everyday life, we weigh the risks and benefits of our actions. People who\nare going out to protests are clearly at a critical juncture where they are\nsaying this state-sanctioned violence is unacceptable, and I am willing to put\nmyself and others potentially at risk,\" she says.\n\nThe open letter she signed recommends ways that protesters, police and local\nofficials can reduce the transmission of the virus.\n\nAmong the major recommendations: police should not use tear gas or pepper\nspray.\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR.

    "title": "Tear Gassing Protesters During An Infectious Outbreak Called 'A Recipe For Disaster'",
    "html": "<p>In nationwide demonstrations against the police killing of <person>George Floyd</person> and other black Americans, protesters are frequently pepper sprayed or enveloped in clouds of tear gas. These crowd-control weapons are rarely lethal, but in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, there are growing calls for police to stop using these chemical irritants, because they can damage the body in ways that can spread the coronavirus and increase the severity of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Even before the coronavirus pandemic, some experts said additional research was needed on the risks of tear gas - an umbrella term for several chemical \"riot control agents\" used by law enforcement. It's known that the chemicals can have both immediate and long-term health effects.</p>\n\n<p>Their widespread use in recent weeks, while an infectious disease continues to spread across the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>, has stunned experts and physicians. The coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 is highly contagious, spreads easily through the air via droplets, and can lead to severe or fatal respiratory illness. Deploying these corrosive, inhalable chemicals could harm people in several ways: expose more people to the virus, compromise the body's ability to fight off the infection and even cause mild infections to become more severe illnesses.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is a recipe for disaster,\" says professor <person>Sven Eric Jordt</person>, a researcher at <org>Duke University School of Medicine</org> who studies the effects of tear gas.</p>\n\n<p>Jordt refers to these chemicals as \"pain gases\" because they activate certain pain-sensing nerves on the skin and in the mucus membranes of the eyes, mouth and nose.</p>\n\n<p>\"You have this excruciating pain, sneezing, coughing, the production of a lot of mucus that obstructs breathing,\" Jordt says.</p>\n\n<p>People describe a burning and stinging sensation, even a sense of asphyxiation and drowning. Sometimes it causes vomiting or allergic reactions.</p>\n\n<p>In law enforcement, officers generally use two types of chemicals for crowd control: CS gas and pepper spray.</p>\n\n<p>The active ingredient in pepper spray, called capsaicin, is derived from chilis. It's often sprayed from cans at close quarters or lobbed into crowds in the form of \"pepper balls.\"</p>\n\n<p>CS gas (o&#8208;chlorobenzylidene malononitrile) is a chlorinated, organic chemical that can induce \"very strong inflammation\" and \"chemical injury\" by burning the skin and airways when inhaled, Jordt says.</p>\n\n<p>\"Using it in the current situation with COVID-19 around is completely irresponsible,\" he adds. \"There are sufficient data proving that tear gas can increase the susceptibility to pathogens, to viruses.\"</p>\n\n<p>Jordt says research on the harms of tear gas has not kept up with its escalating use in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S</location> and around the world in recent years. Many of the safety studies that law enforcement officials rely on date back to the 1950s and 60s, he says.</p>\n\n<p>But a 2014 study from the <org>U.S Army</org> offers an alarming glimpse into how the chemical could escalate the pandemic. The study found that recruits who were exposed to tear gas as part of a training exercise were more likely to get sick with respiratory illnesses like the common cold and the flu.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have a lot of antiviral defenses that can inactivate viruses and prevent them from entering cells,\" he says. \"These are depleted by inhalation of tear gas and also compromised.\"</p>\n\n<p>The findings of the Army study led the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S</location> military to significantly reduce how much recruits were being exposed to the chemical.</p>\n\n<p>\"Even the army realized they had done something wrong and that this was more toxic than they thought before,\" Jordt says.</p>\n\n<p>Even though there is a limited amount of research on this new coronavirus, there are studies from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location> about how other irritants, such as smoking and air pollution, affect COVID-19. These studies indicate that tear gas could also make people more likely to develop severe illness, says Dr. <person>John Balmes</person>, a pulmonologist at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0329581685\">University of California</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> and an expert with the <org>American Thoracic Society</org></p>\n\n<p>\"I actually think we could be promoting COVID-19 by tear gassing protesters,\" says Balmes. \"It causes injury and inflammation to the lining of the airways.\"</p>\n\n<p>Balmes says this period of inflammation sets back the body's defenses, and makes it more likely that someone who already harbors the virus will become sick.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's adding fuel to the fire,\" says Balmes. \"These exposures to tear gas would increase the risk of progression from the asymptomatic infection, to a symptomatic disease.\"</p>\n\n<p>Growing evidence shows many people who have the coronavirus are asymptomatic and don't know they are infected, or are \"presymptomatic\" - infected with the virus and able to infect others, but not yet showing symptoms. With thousands of people jammed together at mass protests, the demonstrations are already primed to be 'superspreading events,' which can lead to an explosion of new cases. Outdoor gatherings typically decrease the chance of spreading the coronavirus. But activities like singing and yelling can increase the risk.</p>\n\n<p>Tear gas and pepper spray can also sow confusion and panic in a crowd. People may rip off their masks and touch their faces, leading to more contamination.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. <person>Amesh Adalja</person>, a professor at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0843506359\">Johns Hopkins University</org>, says the body's reaction to the chemicals cause people to shed more of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>\"If they're coughing, the particles actually emanate and are projectiles that travel about six feet or so and could land on other people,\" says Adalja, who is also a spokesperson for the <org>Infectious Diseases Society of America</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is a way to almost induce the virus to be expelled from people when they are exposed to these agents.\"</p>\n\n<p>Adalja anticipates the protests will inevitably lead to a spike in infections.</p>\n\n<p>\"We know that any kind of social unrest, especially in the midst of an outbreak, is only going to make things worse,\" he says.</p>\n\n<p>He says the most recent example would be bombings in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ye\">Yemen</location> that are exacerbating a cholera outbreak.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. <person>Rohini Haar</person>, an emergency physician in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.oaklnd\">Oakland, Calif.</location>,, has studied the use of riot control agents around the world.</p>\n\n<p>\"These weapons don't actually deescalate tensions in peaceful community policing,\" says Haar who is a lecturer at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0329581685\">University of California</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.berley\">Berkeley</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Haar has also been treating COVID-19 patients. She recognizes there is a danger of spreading the virus at these gatherings, but she would not discourage people from attending the protests and exercising their right to free speech.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's a really tough situation,\" says Haar. \"I think the irony is that people are rightfully and justifiably protesting police violence and are being met with violence that is worsening the pandemic conditions we're living under right now.\"</p>\n\n<p>This week, more than a thousand physicians and health care professionals signed an open letter in support of the demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious disease expert at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0637289137\">University of Chicago</org>, is one of them.</p>\n\n<p>She says it will be difficult to determine whether any spike in cases were a direct result of the protests, because they're happening at a time when many states are also allowing businesses to reopen.</p>\n\n<p>\"In everyday life, we weigh the risks and benefits of our actions. People who are going out to protests are clearly at a critical juncture where they are saying this state-sanctioned violence is unacceptable, and I am willing to put myself and others potentially at risk,\" she says.</p>\n\n<p>The open letter she signed recommends ways that protesters, police and local officials can reduce the transmission of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>Among the major recommendations: police should not use tear gas or pepper spray.</p>\n\n<p>Copyright 2020 NPR.
