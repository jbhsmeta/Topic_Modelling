Once this process is complete, our website will be open for\nregistration. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this\nunprecedented time.\" director of communications Alan Milton said: \"We hope to\npublish our return to safe activity doc in the next week at which stage there\nmay be more clarity around the Cul Camps.\"Another source said the did not\nexpect camps booked in July to go ahead at this point.However, it is hoped\nthat some events will be run in August, provided the clubs in question can\nallow for social distancing.\"It depends on the size of the club and what kind\nof facilities they have, if they have large outdoor areas or not,\" the source\nsaid.\"If a club has normally 200 children in one group, they might only be\nable to accept 80 for the summer camps.\"While schools and colleges will remain\nclosed until September, some summer camps have been deemed safer due to the\nfact they are held outdoors, which lessens the spread of coronavirus.National\nCul Camps co-ordinator Charlie Harrison is finalising a roadmap for how these\ncamps can take place nationwide, HSE guidelines permitting.Earlier this week,\nit appeared the Cul Camps would be able to take place this summer, but all\nactivities will have to be carried out with strict safeguards.Dr Tony Holohan,\nthe chief medical officer, said: \"Government is going to consider and accept\nthem before they become part of any easing of restrictions.\" Independent",

Once this process is complete, our website will be open for registration.  Thank you for your patience and understanding during this unprecedented time.\" director of communications <person>Alan Milton</person> said: \"We hope to publish our return to safe activity doc in the next week at which stage there may be more clarity around the C&#250;l Camps.\"Another source said the  did not expect camps booked in July to go ahead at this point.However, it is hoped that some events will be run in August, provided the clubs in question can allow for social distancing.\"It depends on the size of the club and what kind of facilities they have, if they have large outdoor areas or not,\" the source said.\"If a club has normally  200 children in one group, they might only be able to accept 80 for the summer camps.\"While schools and colleges will remain closed until September, some summer camps have been deemed safer due to the fact they are held outdoors, which lessens the spread of coronavirus.National C&#250;l Camps co-ordinator <person>Charlie Harrison</person> is finalising a roadmap for how these camps can take place nationwide, HSE guidelines permitting.Earlier this week, it appeared the C&#250;l Camps would be able to take place this summer, but all activities will have to be carried out with strict  safeguards.Dr <person>Tony Holohan</person>, the chief medical officer, said: \"Government is going to consider and accept them before they become part of any easing of restrictions.\" Independent</p>",
