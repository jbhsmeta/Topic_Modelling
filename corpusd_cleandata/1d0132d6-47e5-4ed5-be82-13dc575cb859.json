(WJHL) - A Washington County, Tennessee deputy has been\nfired over a remark made on Facebook over the weekend.\n\nThe Washington County Sheriff's Office announced the dismissal of Deputy Matt\nCasura on Monday.\n\nIn the remark, Casura stated that \"open fire should have been issued on anyone\nparticipating\" in the Minneapolis riots, according to Chief Deputy Leighta\nLaitinen.\n\n\"Officer Casura's comment goes against the values and standards of the\nWashington County Sheriff's Office,\" said Chief Deputy Leighta Laitinen in a\nnews release. \"Officers must regard the discharge of their duties as a public\ntrust and recognize their responsibilities as a public servant. Even while\noff-duty, officers must be mindful of their conduct in private life, how that\nconduct reflects on the Sheriff's Office and how it can damage the trust of\nthe community.\"\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, Casura was initially suspended over the\nremark, but after additional review, it was determined that stronger\ndisciplinary action was warranted.",

Even while off-duty, officers must be mindful of their conduct in private life, how that conduct reflects on the <org>Sheriff's Office</org> and how it can damage the trust of the community.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to the sheriff's office, Casura was initially suspended over the remark, but after additional review, it was determined that stronger disciplinary action was warranted.</p>",
