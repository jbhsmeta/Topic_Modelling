    "text": "The space that is today occupied by First Community Bank of Milton, 202\nMerchant Row, is the composite of four buildings on the east side of the\nstreet, each with its own history. The covered drive-through is on space that\nwas once occupied by a fifth building known as the P of H Hall. A plaque is\nattached to an exterior wall within the drive-though commemorating the\nbuilding's history.\n\nP of H stands for Patrons of Husbandry. It later became the Grange, area\nhistorian and Milton College Main Hall Museum curator Doug Welch said. He\ndescribed the organization as fraternal and agricultural. The three-story\nwooden hall was built in 1866 and razed in 1975. The plaque in place today\nstates that the Du Lac Grange operated from the building between 1873 and\n1924, and the Milton Grange operated between 1927 and 1953. The building later\nhoused retail establishments and a tavern, Welch said.\n\nMoving north to south from the drive-through, the bank's buildings include: a\ncream brick two-story which was used as a livery, transforming, around 1918,\ninto an automobile service garage; a red brick building which served as\nFarmers Bank built by John Paul Sr. in 1911; the Thorpe Rexall Drug Store\nbuilding built in 1906, and a building, which, within its history, served as\nthe Milton Junction Post Office, and was purchased by Julius H. Strassburg in\n1911, Welch said.\n\nJulius operated a harness shop from the building and his wife, Martha Bruch,\nwhom he married in Fort Atkinson in 1902, had a shoe repair business,\naccording to Julius' obituary. The Strassburgs operated their establishment\nuntil Julius retired in 1953. He died in 1954. His son, Chester, took over the\nbusiness, operating it as C.B. Strassburg, \"Headquarters for Lee Overalls,\"\naccording to his recently uncovered sign, until he closed the store, choosing,\ninstead, to operate a laundromat. The tin Strassburg sign was hidden behind a\nthen-newly constructed plywood fa\u00e7ade, which supported a new sign: Highlander\nLaundry. That change was made in 1969, Welch said.\n\nChester, known locally as \"Chet,\" was born in Milton Junction in 1915, and was\nmarried to Margaret Lenore Kidder, according to information supplied by\nauthor, historian, and film producer Clark Kidder. Margaret was born in\nMassachusetts in 1914. The couple was married in Milton in 1939. The couple\nhad two children, Richard and Barbara, born in 1943 and 1947, respectively.\n\nIn 1973, when Margaret's mother Nancy Kidder died, Margaret was living at 46\nSouth John Paul Road, according to Nancy's obituary.\n\nMargaret died in 2001 and Chester in 2005. Richard died while living in\nEvansville in 1995, and Barbara died while living in Madison in 2004.\n\nThe bank purchased the building from Jon Sockness in 2007, First Community\nBank of Milton President and CEO Brendon Wilkinson said.\n\nFirst Community Bank of Milton finds its historical inception with Farmers\nBank, which opened in 1911, Wilkinson said.\n\nJohn Paul, after whom John Paul Road is named, was the bank's first president,\nhe said.\n\nThe Paul family operated Farmers Bank for three generations, Welch said.\n\nMaterials printed by Farmers Bank in the Milton Courier in 1983 thanked bank\ncustomers for their loyalty, noting: \"We have completed our remodeling and\nexpansion program and therefore have the most convenient drive-in lanes and\nwalk-up window facilities to serve you better.\"\n\nFirst Community Bank of Milton, under the name First Community Bancshares,\npurchased the Farmers Bank buildings in 1986. the corporation changed its name\nto First Community Bank of Milton in 1989, Wilkinson said.",

    "title": "Four buildings of First Community",
    "html": "<p>The space that is today occupied by <org>First Community Bank of Milton</org>, <location>202 Merchant Row</location>, is the composite of four buildings on the east side of the street, each with its own history. The covered drive-through is on space that was once occupied by a fifth building known as the P of H Hall. A plaque is attached to an exterior wall within the drive-though commemorating the building's history.</p>\n<p>P of H stands for Patrons of Husbandry. It later became the Grange, area historian and <org>Milton College Main Hall Museum</org> curator <person>Doug Welch</person> said. He described the organization as fraternal and agricultural. The three-story wooden hall was built in 1866 and razed in 1975. The plaque in place today states that the Du Lac Grange operated from the building between 1873 and 1924, and the Milton Grange operated between 1927 and 1953. The building later housed retail establishments and a tavern, Welch said.</p>\n\n<p>Moving north to south from the drive-through, the bank's buildings include: a cream brick two-story which was used as a livery, transforming, around 1918, into an automobile service garage; a red brick building which served as <org>Farmers Bank</org> built by <person>John Paul Sr</person>. in 1911; the <org>Thorpe Rexall Drug Store</org> building built in 1906, and a building, which, within its history, served as the <org>Milton Junction Post Office</org>, and was purchased by <person>Julius H. Strassburg</person> in 1911, Welch said.</p>\n\n<p>Julius operated a harness shop from the building and his wife, <person>Martha Bruch</person>, whom he married in Fort Atkinson in 1902, had a shoe repair business, according to Julius' obituary. The Strassburgs operated their establishment until Julius retired in 1953. He died in 1954. His son, Chester, took over the business, operating it as <person>C.B. Strassburg</person>, \"Headquarters for Lee Overalls,\" according to his recently uncovered sign, until he closed the store, choosing, instead, to operate a laundromat. The tin Strassburg sign was hidden behind a then-newly constructed plywood fa&#231;ade, which supported a new sign: Highlander Laundry. That change was made in 1969, Welch said.</p>\n\n<p>Chester, known locally as \"Chet,\" was born in Milton Junction in 1915, and was married to <person>Margaret Lenore Kidder</person>, according to information supplied by author, historian, and film producer <person>Clark Kidder</person>. Margaret was born in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ma\">Massachusetts</location> in 1914. The couple was married in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.milton\">Milton</location> in 1939. The couple had two children, Richard and Barbara, born in 1943 and 1947, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 1973, when Margaret's mother <person>Nancy Kidder</person> died, Margaret was living at <location>46 South John Paul Road</location>, according to Nancy's obituary.</p>\n\n<p>Margaret died in 2001 and Chester in 2005. Richard died while living in Evansville in 1995, and Barbara died while living in Madison in 2004.</p>\n\n<p>The bank purchased the building from <person>Jon Sockness</person> in 2007, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0101985056\">First Community Bank</org> of Milton President and CEO <org>Brendon Wilkinson</org> said.</p>\n\n<p><org>First Community Bank of Milton</org> finds its historical inception with <org>Farmers Bank</org>, which opened in 1911, Wilkinson said.</p>\n\n<p>John Paul, after whom <location>John Paul Road</location> is named, was the bank's first president, he said.</p>\n\n<p>The Paul family operated <org>Farmers Bank</org> for three generations, Welch said.</p>\n\n<p>Materials printed by <org>Farmers Bank</org> in the <org>Milton Courier</org> in 1983 thanked bank customers for their loyalty, noting: \"We have completed our remodeling and expansion program and therefore have the most convenient drive-in lanes and walk-up window facilities to serve you better.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>First Community Bank of Milton</org>, under the name <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FCBC\">First Community Bancshares</org>, purchased the <org>Farmers Bank</org> buildings in 1986. the corporation changed its name to <org>First Community Bank of Milton</org> in 1989, Wilkinson said.</p>",
