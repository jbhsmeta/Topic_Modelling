    "text": "Unexpected encounters with rock and water have added $2.4 million to the price\ntag of the Harford Road Bridge \u0096 and more cost overruns aren't being ruled out\nby the city Department of Transportation.\n\nThe latest, and by far the largest, group of \"EWOs,\" or extra work orders,\nwere approved last week by the Board of Estimates to Technopref Industries,\nthe U.S. subsidiary of France's Demathieu Bard.\n\nThe overruns will pay for two construction items not anticipated by the DOT\nand its high-priced bridge consultant, Whitman, Requardt & Associates.\n(Earlier EWOs paid to WR&A had pushed up the bridge's design costs from $1.1\nmillion to $2.6 million.)\n\n\"Excessive rock excavation\" was the most recent culprit cited by DOT.\n\nBecause 125% more rock has been found at the Herring Run bridge site than\nanticipated by the agency or Whitman Requardt, the contract with Technopref\nhad to be renegotiated.\n\nThe price of rock excavation has jumped from $65 per cubic yard to $188 per\ncubic yard, DOT records show.\n\nThose negotiations resulted in the price of rock excavation jumping from $65\nper cubic yard to $188 per cubic yard, which added $1,606,930 to the bridge's\ncost.\n\n(Technopref originally wanted $212/CY for new rock removal, but DOT says it\npushed the price down to $188/CY, which is still three times above the\noriginal fee.)\n\nBlaming the Weather\n\nThis wasn't the only problem. A DOT-approved design to divert Herring Run\naround the construction site quickly proved faulty, allowing the stream to\njump its banks and wreak havoc during \"severe weather events.\"\n\nA new stream channel, required so that the foundations can safely be built,\nwill cost $823,908.\n\nThe new concrete-girder bridge, replacing a 1911 bridge over Herring Run, was\nstarted in November 2018.\n\nTechnopref was selected by then-Mayor Catherine Pugh and the spending board as\nthe lowest of five bids.\n\nThe bridge is now 15% above its original price of $19 million, and \"there is a\npossibility that we will have to do additional EWO's that will depend on\nweather delays and possible unforeseen issues that may arise,\" DOT spokesman\nGerman Vigil said last week.\n\nThe bridge is scheduled to open by the start of 2022, allowing Harford Road to\nreturn to its former role as a northeast thoroughfare used by 22,000-plus\nvehicles a day.\n\nEWO for Edmondson Avenue Bridge\n\nLast week, the Board of Estimates approved another EWO for a bridge project.\n\nTutor Perini Corp. was paid $1.1 million after it had widened a path in the\nGwynns Falls Valley, beneath the Edmondson Avenue Bridge, to accommodate its\nequipment.\n\n\"An Engineer's Estimate was performed to determine a reasonable cost for the\nproposed work,\" DOT reported to the spending board. \"The work was performed\nprior to board approval in order to ensure public safety.\"\n\nTwo prior EWOs granted to Tutor Perini had upped the price of the\nreconstructed bridge by $472,000.",

(Earlier EWOs paid to WR&amp;A had pushed up the bridge's design costs from <money>$1.1 million</money> to <money>$2.6 million</money>.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Excessive rock excavation\" was the most recent culprit cited by DOT.</p>\n\n<p>Because 125% more rock has been found at the Herring Run bridge site than anticipated by the agency or Whitman Requardt, the contract with Technopref had to be renegotiated.</p>\n\n<p>The price of rock excavation has jumped from <money>$65</money> per cubic yard to <money>$188</money> per cubic yard, DOT records show.</p>\n\n<p>Those negotiations resulted in the price of rock excavation jumping from <money>$65</money> per cubic yard to <money>$188</money> per cubic yard, which added <money>$1,606,930</money> to the bridge's cost.</p>\n\n<p>(Technopref originally wanted <money>$212</money>/CY for new rock removal, but DOT says it pushed the price down to <money>$188</money>/CY, which is still three times above the original fee.)</p>\n\n<p>Blaming the Weather</p>\n\n<p>This wasn't the only problem. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Tokyo:7063\">A DOT</org>-approved design to divert Herring Run around the construction site quickly proved faulty, allowing the stream to jump its banks and wreak havoc during \"severe weather events.\"</p>\n\n<p>A new stream channel, required so that the foundations can safely be built, will cost <money>$823,908</money>.</p>\n\n<p>The new concrete-girder bridge, replacing a 1911 bridge over Herring Run, was started in <chron>November 2018</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Technopref was selected by then-Mayor <person>Catherine Pugh</person> and the spending board as the lowest of five bids.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge is now 15% above its original price of <money>$19 million</money>, and \"there is a possibility that we will have to do additional EWO's that will depend on weather delays and possible unforeseen issues that may arise,\" DOT spokesman <person>German Vigil</person> said last week.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge is scheduled to open by the start of 2022, allowing <location>Harford Road</location> to return to its former role as a northeast thoroughfare used by 22,000-plus vehicles a day.</p>\n\n<p>EWO for <location>Edmondson Avenue Bridge</location></p>\n\n<p>Last week, the <org>Board of Estimates</org> approved another EWO for a bridge project.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:TPC\">Tutor Perini Corp.</org> was paid <money>$1.1 million</money> after it had widened a path in the <location>Gwynns Falls Valley</location>, beneath the <location>Edmondson Avenue Bridge</location>, to accommodate its equipment.</p>\n\n<p>\"An Engineer's Estimate was performed to determine a reasonable cost for the proposed work,\" DOT reported to the spending board. \"The work was performed prior to board approval in order to ensure public safety.\"</p>\n\n<p>Two prior EWOs granted to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:TPC\">Tutor Perini</org> had upped the price of the reconstructed bridge by <money>$472,000</money>.</p>",
