    "text": "Banking & Fintech  \nTheme: The banking sector is one of the major pillars of the Mauritian\neconomy, contributing around 12% of our entire GDP. Despite the fact that\nMauritian banks are adequately capitalised, they still face the risk of\nincurring high default rates if no drastic measures are implemented due to\nhigh exposure to the tourism and household segment. There is also the risk of\nfeaturing in the EU Blacklist, if Mauritius does not comply with the 5\nremaining recommendations.\n\n(To view the original document, please click on the link below:  \n<http://reports.aiidatapro.com/brokers/SwanSecuritiesLtd/BudgetBrief2020-2021.pdf>)\n\nMeasures:  \n** To comply with these 5 recommendations under the FATF, the following\nmeasures will be implemented: (a) Risk-based supervisions in accordance with\nthe recommendations of the FATF; (b) Targeted outreach programmes to promote\nclear understanding of moneylaundering and terrorist financing risks; (c)\nIncreased reporting of suspicious transactions; (d) Targeted financial\nsanctions in cases of terrorist financing; and (e) Timely access to beneficial\nownership information. If Mauritius avoid this blacklist, a reputational\ndamage will be averted and thereby Mauritian banks can continue to attract\nfurther foreign deposits and continue be able to provide loans denominated in\nforeign currencies.  \n  \n** In accordance with the plan to 'Foster Entrepreneurship', the DBM Ltd will\nprovide Rs 10 Billion to support distressed SMEs up to a maximum of Rs 10\nMillion per company at a very attractive rate of 0.5% per annum. This cheap\ntype of financing will ensure business continuity as the SMEs might be able to\ncover their fixed costs.\n\n**  To facilitate cash flow of SMEs, Maubank will provide factoring facilities\nwith the help of Investment Support Programme (ISP Ltd) which will subsidise\nhalf of the factoring fees.  \n  \n**  The government will provide a minimum monthly support of Rs 5,100 to each\nbeneficiary facing technical unemployment over the next 6 months. This whole\nsupport is expected to cost around Rs 15 Billion and will enable those\nindividuals to meet their short term financing needs. Around 29% of the total\nloan portfolio on our island is towards the household sector. Providing a\nmonthly minimum support will therefore reduce some potential defaults in\nhousehold loans.  \n  \n**  The announcement of a new market, as previously mentioned in last year's\nbudget, on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius for start-up and SMEs has been made\nin this year's budget as well. This line up very well to the core message of\nthis budget of boosting Mauritian entrepreneurship.  \n  \nOther notable measures :  \n**  The following new products will be introduced as per the recommendations\nof the 10-year blueprint:\n\n**  The Central Bank digital currency.\n\n**  An insurance wrapper\n\n**  Variable Capital Companies\n\n**  An inaugural Sukuk issuance by the Bank of Mauritius\n\n**  Green and Blue Bond frameworks by the Bank of Mauritius.\n\nOutlook: While the government has announced a series of measures for SMEs, no\nsignificant detail has been provided on the Rs 80 Billion to be invested\nthrough the MIC Ltd. As further details are revealed concerning this Rs 80\nBillion investment, the outlook on the financial services segment will become\nmuch clearer.\n\n****\n\nCopyright: Swan Securities Ltd , All rights reserved.  \nFor further information please contact: Swan Securities Ltd ,  \nSwan Centre  \n10 Intendance Street  \nPort Louis, Mauritius  \nTel: +230 208 7010; Fax: +230 208 6898  \ne-mail:\n[securities.research@swanforlife.com](mailto:securities.research@swanforlife.com),\nweb: <https://www.swanforlife.com/en>",

    "html": "<p>Banking &amp; Fintech&#160;<br /> Theme: The banking sector is one of the major pillars of the Mauritian economy, contributing around 12% of our entire GDP. Despite the fact that Mauritian banks are adequately capitalised, they still face the risk of incurring high default rates if no drastic measures are implemented due to high exposure to the tourism and household segment. There is also the risk of featuring in the EU Blacklist, if <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mu\">Mauritius</location> does not comply with the 5 remaining recommendations.&#160;</p><p>(To view the original document, please click on the link below:<br /><a href=\"http://reports.aiidatapro.com/brokers/SwanSecuritiesLtd/BudgetBrief2020-2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://reports.aiidatapro.com/brokers/SwanSecuritiesLtd/BudgetBrief2020-2021.pdf</a>)&#160;</p><p>Measures:&#160;<br /> **  To comply with these 5 recommendations under the FATF, the following measures will be implemented: (a) Risk-based supervisions in accordance with the recommendations of the FATF; (b) Targeted outreach programmes to promote clear understanding of moneylaundering and terrorist financing risks; (c) Increased reporting of suspicious transactions; (d) Targeted financial sanctions in cases of terrorist financing; and (e) Timely access to beneficial ownership information. If <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mu\">Mauritius</location> avoid this blacklist, a reputational damage will be averted and thereby Mauritian banks can continue to attract further foreign deposits and continue be able to provide loans denominated in foreign currencies.&#160;<br /> &#160;<br /> **  In accordance with the plan to 'Foster Entrepreneurship', the <org>DBM Ltd</org> will provide <money>Rs 10 Billion</money> to support distressed SMEs up to a maximum of <money>Rs 10 Million</money> per company at a very attractive rate of 0.5% per annum. This cheap type of financing will ensure business continuity as the SMEs might be able to cover their fixed costs.&#160;&#160;</p><p>** &#160;To facilitate cash flow of SMEs, Maubank will provide factoring facilities with the help of Investment Support Programme (<org>ISP Ltd</org>) which will subsidise half of the factoring fees.&#160; &#160;<br /> &#160;<br /> ** &#160;The government will provide a minimum monthly support of <money>Rs 5,100</money> to each beneficiary facing technical unemployment over the next 6 months. This whole support is expected to cost around <money>Rs 15 Billion</money> and will enable those individuals to meet their short term financing needs. Around 29% of the total loan portfolio on our island is towards the household sector. Providing a monthly minimum support will therefore reduce some potential defaults in household loans.&#160;<br /> &#160;<br /> ** &#160;The announcement of a new market, as previously mentioned in last year's budget, on the <org>Stock Exchange of Mauritius</org> for start-up and SMEs has been made in this year's budget as well.
