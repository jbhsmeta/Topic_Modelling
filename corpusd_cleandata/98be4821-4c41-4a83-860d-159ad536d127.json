    "text": "EARLIER THIS MONTH the Royal Canadian Navy took the precaution of placing two\nships companies--HMCS Ville de Quebec and Moncton\\--into a 14 day quarantine\nat the Westin NovaScotian in Halifax prior to their operational deployments.\nWhile this course of action meant an additional two weeks of separation from\nfamily and friends during this stressful period of pandemic lockdown, one has\nto applaud the decision taken by the Navy brass.\n\nFor anyone familiar with the close confines of a modern warship it is readily\napparent that any outbreak of COVID-19 aboard ship would be uncontainable.\nWith shared sleeping quarters, communal messing facilities and ablution\nstations there is no possibility of enforcing quarantine for infected\npersonnel. It is also true that if they are on an operational deployment at\nsea, then calling in sick from work is not an option.\n\nOur American allies are still dealing with the aftermath of one such an\nemergency.\n\nIn early March the USS Theodore Roosevelt--a nuclear powered aircraft carrier\n--had a five-day port call in the Vietnamese city of Da Nang. Although the\nCOVID-19 outbreak In Vietnam at that time was still minimal, several of the\nU.S. sailors stayed at a hotel in Da Nang in which two fellow guests were\nBritish tourists who had been infected with the virus.\n\nOnce the Roosevelt was back out to sea several sailors reported flu like\nsymptoms. By 24 March testing concluded that the COVID-19 was indeed aboard\nthe carrier, putting Its nearly 5,000 crew members at risk. Senior navy\nofficials were indecisive as to what course of action to take. This prompted\nthe Captain of the Roosevelt to send out an email with an attached memo to 10\nof his superior officers and fellow captains. The contents of the memo were\nleaked to the San Francisco Chronicle and published the following day.\n\nIn pleading for the immediate removal of 90 per cent of his crew to nearby\nGuam for their own safety, Captain Brett Crozier wrote \"We are not at war, and\ntherefore cannot allow a single sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic\nunnecessarily.\"\n\nThe revelation that the ship was stricken with the spread of a deadly virus\ncaused embarrassment for the senior navy officials who appeared to have been\nparalyzed into inactivity while their own sailors remained in peril.\n\nWhile Crozier's memo did galvanize the start of an evacuation of the majority\nof the Roosevelt crew, the embarrassment Its release to the media caused led\nthe acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly to remove Crozier from command. This\nknee-jerk relieving Crozier of command received support from President Donald\nTrump. \"I thought it was terrible, what [Crozier] did to write a letter. I\nmean this isn't a class on literature,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nVideo footage of the dismissed Crozier exiting the Roosevelt to the\nspontaneous applause of his grateful crew quickly went viral.\n\nObviously Modly did not see the videos or else he read the tea leaves wrong\nwhen he decided to double down on Crozier's alleged disloyalty.\n\nAfter flying all the way to Guam, Modly boarded the carrier and addressed the\nRoosevelt's crew over the ship's loudspeaker. In a 15 minute tirade that was\nlaced with profanity Modly accused Crazier of having leaked his own memo to\nthe media. In Modly's estimation, Crazier was \"too naive or too stupid to be a\ncommanding officer of a ship like this.\"\n\nRecordings of Modly's rant soon went public and in the wake of the angry\npublic backlash which his words had generated, the acting Secretary resigned\nthe following day.\n\nFor his part Captain Crazier remains in quarantined isolation in Guam as he\nwas one of over 655 crewmembers to contract COVID-19 aboard the Roosevelt. At\ntime of writing, one U.S. Sailor had died from this outbreak.\n\nOne has to hope that in the wake of all this Crazier will be reinstated as the\nCaptain of the Roosevelt.\n\nThere is a lesson the RCN can learn from this incident and that is that since\nwe are not at war and the virus Is real, the safety of our sailors must take\npriority over operational duties.\n\nABOVE RIGHT: The USS Theodore Roosevelt had its first confirmed case of\nCOVID-19 on 24 March. Six days later her captain was still awaiting direction\nfrom the Pentagon.\n\nPlease Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.\n\nScott Taylor\n\npublisher",

    "title": "ON TARGET: Using Common Sense to Deal With COVID-19 At Sea.(COMMENT)",
    "html": "<p>EARLIER THIS MONTH the <org>Royal Canadian Navy</org> took the precaution of\nplacing two ships companies--HMCS Ville de <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.nb.monton\">Moncton</location>--into a 14\nday quarantine at the <location>Westin NovaScotian</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.ns.halifx\">Halifax</location> prior to their\noperational deployments. While this course of action meant an additional\ntwo weeks of separation from family and friends during this stressful\nperiod of pandemic lockdown, one has to applaud the decision taken by\nthe <org>Navy</org> brass.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone familiar with the close confines of a modern warship it\nis readily apparent that any outbreak of COVID-19 aboard ship would be\nuncontainable. With shared sleeping quarters, communal messing\nfacilities and ablution stations there is no possibility of enforcing\nquarantine for infected personnel. It is also true that if they are on\nan operational deployment at sea, then calling in sick from work is not\nan option.</p>\n\n<p>Our American allies are still dealing with the aftermath of one\nsuch an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>In early March the USS Theodore Roosevelt--a nuclear powered\naircraft carrier--had a five-day port call in the Vietnamese city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/vn.dg\">Da\nNang</location>. Although the COVID-19 outbreak In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/vn\">Vietnam</location> at that time was still\nminimal, several of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> sailors stayed at a hotel in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/vn.dg\">Da Nang</location> in\nwhich two fellow guests were British tourists who had been infected with\nthe virus.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Roosevelt was back out to sea several sailors reported flu\nlike symptoms. By 24 March testing concluded that the COVID-19 was\nindeed aboard the carrier, putting Its nearly 5,000 crew members at\nrisk. Senior navy officials were indecisive as to what course of action\nto take. This prompted the Captain of the Roosevelt to send out an email\nwith an attached memo to 10 of his superior officers and fellow\ncaptains. The contents of the memo were leaked to the <org>San Francisco\nChronicle</org> and published the following day.</p>\n\n<p>In pleading for the immediate removal of 90 per cent of his crew to\nnearby <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gu\">Guam</location> for their own safety, Captain <person>Brett Crozier</person> wrote \"We\nare not at war, and therefore cannot allow a single sailor to perish as\na result of this pandemic unnecessarily.\"</p>\n\n<p>The revelation that the ship was stricken with the spread of a\ndeadly virus caused embarrassment for the senior navy officials who\nappeared to have been paralyzed into inactivity while their own sailors\nremained in peril.</p>\n\n<p>While Crozier's memo did galvanize the start of an evacuation\nof the majority of the Roosevelt crew, the embarrassment Its release to\nthe media caused led the acting Navy Secretary <person>Thomas Modly</person> to remove\nCrozier from command. This knee-jerk relieving Crozier of command\nreceived support from President <person>Donald Trump</person>. \"I thought it was\nterrible, what [Crozier] did to write a letter. I mean this isn't a\nclass on literature,\" Trump told reporters.</p>\n\n<p>Video footage of the dismissed Crozier exiting the Roosevelt to the\nspontaneous applause of his grateful crew quickly went viral.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously Modly did not see the videos or else he read the tea\nleaves wrong when he decided to double down on Crozier's alleged\ndisloyalty.</p>\n\n<p>After flying all the way to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gu\">Guam</location>, Modly boarded the carrier and\naddressed the Roosevelt's crew over the ship's loudspeaker. In\na 15 minute tirade that was laced with profanity Modly accused Crazier\nof having leaked his own memo to the media. In Modly's estimation,\nCrazier was \"too naive or too stupid to be a commanding officer of\na ship like this.\"</p>\n\n<p>Recordings of Modly's rant soon went public and in the wake of\nthe angry public backlash which his words had generated, the acting\nSecretary resigned the following day.</p>\n\n<p>For his part Captain Crazier remains in quarantined isolation in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gu\">Guam</location> as he was one of over 655 crewmembers to contract COVID-19 aboard\nthe Roosevelt. At time of writing, one <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Sailor had died from this\noutbreak.</p>\n\n<p>One has to hope that in the wake of all this Crazier will be\nreinstated as the Captain of the Roosevelt.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lesson the RCN can learn from this incident and that is\nthat since we are not at war and the virus Is real, the safety of our\nsailors must take priority over operational duties.</p>\n\n<p>ABOVE RIGHT: The USS Theodore Roosevelt had its first confirmed\ncase of COVID-19 on 24 March. Six days later her captain was still\nawaiting direction from the Pentagon.</p>\n\n<p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright\nrestrictions.</p>\n\n<p><person>Scott Taylor</person></p>\n\n<p>publisher</p>",
