    "text": "Love, education and the need to come together as a community was part of the\nmessage Byesville Mayor Jay Jackson shared with attendees at the Black Lives\nMatter protest held Saturday afternoon at the Guernsey County Courthouse.\n\n\"I was thinking about as a man, as a person, as a leader, what can we do to\ntry to combat and stop the injustice and racism,\" Jackson said. \"It's a\ndisease that some say is incurable. But, I believe it can be curable. I\nbelieve it starts with each and every one of us and every person out there.\"\n\nJackson went on to tell the crowd that he believes the cure begins with\neducation. It begins with everyone learning about who they are and where they\nare from. He also encouraged the crowd to, as a society, be an example and to\nalso be the change they wanted to see.\n\nJackson said that when he was growing up in Cambridge, he had all kinds of\nrole models, both black and white, and that these were the people who helped\nshape him into the man he is today.\n\nJackson also encouraged parents, grandparents and other family members to take\ntime to show their children love and how to love, not hate.\n\n\"The only way I know in my heart and in my mind that we are going to cure this\nthing is through love, standing together, working together, working out our\ndifferences and just a lot of common sense. Sometimes, that common sense gets\nlost,\" Jackson said.\n\nJackson, whose speech was interrupted multiple times by rounds of applause\nfrom the crowd, was one of several speakers to address those in attendance\nwith a message of peace and hope.\n\n\"This is part of a healing process,\" Cambridge Mayor Tom Orr said of the\npeaceful protest. \"Cambridge and Guernsey County, truthfully, we are in a\ngreat place to help heal the nation. They could take some lessons from us, I\nthink. \"\n\nBetween ministers, community leaders and students, Orr thought that there was\na nice mix of people in attendance.\n\nThe protest, which was approved by the county commissioners to be held at the\ncourthouse, had well over 100 people in attendance. There were tables set up\nto provide drinking water for the attendees along with tables that contained\nsupplies for making signs for those who didn't bring one.\n\nAfter the speeches ended, the protesters took to the sidewalk in an orderly\nmanner and held up signs to passing traffic, saying \"Black Lives Matter\" and\n\"No justice, no peace.\"\n\nCounty Commissioner Skip Gardener said the commissioners were fine with the\ngathering because they knew the organizers who had submitted the written\nrequest to gather at the courthouse.\n\n\"There were some good speakers with a lot of good points,\" Gardener said. \"I\njust think I'm very respectful of the fact that it was a nice law-abiding\ndemonstration and that people have the right to express their opinions. I'm\nglad to be here, just to have a small part and be here.\"\n\nThere was some disturbance during the speaking portion, which came from\npassing traffic and several vehicles squealing tires as they sat at the light\non Eighth Street and Wheeling Avenue.\n\nCambridge Police Department pulled over one of the vehicles and had it towed\nafter the driver was cited for reckless operation. According to officer Chris\nGebhart, the driver may be facing additional charges as well.\n\n\"People were squealing tires. We had a black truck pull through here and\nsqueal their tires. We couldn't get to him. By the time we looked, he was\nalready past the police department. The blue car (the one towed) happened to\nhave two cars in front of him and was in the turn lane, and we were able to\nget to him before he got up the street.\"\n\nGebhart wasn't sure what all the driver was charged with, but noted the\nreckless operation charge is why the vehicle was towed. The reason for\nsquealing tires and disrupting the protest is not known.\n\n\"We can't have somebody doing that,\" Gebhart said. \"It takes a split second to\nlose control of the vehicle and end up in the middle of all these people on\nthe courthouse square. We can't have that.\"\n\n\"The ones that drive by, they don't understand. They truly don't understand,\"\nOrr said. \"Honestly, when I heard they were going to do this, I didn't\nunderstand. But I came here and you can feel the emotion here.\"\n\nOrr noted that the police were out on standby during the protest and he also\nnoted that police, who applauded along with the protesters at many of the\ncomments made during the speeches, are people too.",

    "html": "<p>Love, education and the need to come together as a community was part of the message Byesville Mayor <person>Jay Jackson</person> shared with attendees at the <org>Black Lives Matter</org> protest held Saturday afternoon at the <location>Guernsey County Courthouse</location>.</p>\n<p>\"I was thinking about as a man, as a person, as a leader, what can we do to try to combat and stop the injustice and racism,\" Jackson said. \"It's a disease that some say is incurable. But, I believe it can be curable. I believe it starts with each and every one of us and every person out there.\"</p>\n\n<p>Jackson went on to tell the crowd that he believes the cure begins with education. It begins with everyone learning about who they are and where they are from. He also encouraged the crowd to, as a society, be an example and to also be the change they wanted to see.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson said that when he was growing up in Cambridge, he had all kinds of role models, both black and white, and that these were the people who helped shape him into the man he is today.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson also encouraged parents, grandparents and other family members to take time to show their children love and how to love, not hate.</p>\n\n<p>\"The only way I know in my heart and in my mind that we are going to cure this thing is through love, standing together, working together, working out our differences and just a lot of common sense. Sometimes, that common sense gets lost,\" Jackson said.</p>\n\n<p>Jackson, whose speech was interrupted multiple times by rounds of applause from the crowd, was one of several speakers to address those in attendance with a message of peace and hope.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is part of a healing process,\" Cambridge Mayor <person>Tom Orr</person> said of the peaceful protest. \"Cambridge and Guernsey County, truthfully, we are in a great place to help heal the nation. They could take some lessons from us, I think. \"</p>\n\n<p>Between ministers, community leaders and students, Orr thought that there was a nice mix of people in attendance.</p>\n\n<p>The protest, which was approved by the county commissioners to be held at the courthouse, had well over 100 people in attendance. There were tables set up to provide drinking water for the attendees along with tables that contained supplies for making signs for those who didn't bring one.</p>\n\n<p>After the speeches ended, the protesters took to the sidewalk in an orderly manner and held up signs to passing traffic, saying \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"No justice, no peace.\"</p>\n\n<p>County Commissioner <person>Skip Gardener</person> said the commissioners were fine with the gathering because they knew the organizers who had submitted the written request to gather at the courthouse.</p>\n\n<p>\"There were some good speakers with a lot of good points,\" Gardener said. \"I just think I'm very respectful of the fact that it was a nice law-abiding demonstration and that people have the right to express their opinions. I'm glad to be here, just to have a small part and be here.\"</p>\n\n<p>There was some disturbance during the speaking portion, which came from passing traffic and several vehicles squealing tires as they sat at the light on <location>Eighth Street</location> and <location>Wheeling Avenue</location>.</p>\n\n<p><org>Cambridge Police Department</org> pulled over one of the vehicles and had it towed after the driver was cited for reckless operation. According to officer <person>Chris Gebhart</person>, the driver may be facing additional charges as well.</p>\n\n<p>\"People were squealing tires. We had a black truck pull through here and squeal their tires. We couldn't get to him. By the time we looked, he was already past the police department. The blue car (the one towed) happened to have two cars in front of him and was in the turn lane, and we were able to get to him before he got up the street.\"</p>\n\n<p>Gebhart wasn't sure what all the driver was charged with, but noted the reckless operation charge is why the vehicle was towed. The reason for squealing tires and disrupting the protest is not known.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can't have somebody doing that,\" Gebhart said. \"It takes a split second to lose control of the vehicle and end up in the middle of all these people on the courthouse square. We can't have that.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The ones that drive by, they don't understand. They truly don't understand,\" Orr said. \"Honestly, when I heard they were going to do this, I didn't understand. But I came here and you can feel the emotion here.\"</p>\n\n<p>Orr noted that the police were out on standby during the protest and he also noted that police, who applauded along with the protesters at many of the comments made during the speeches, are people too.</p>",
