    "text": "The Hamilton Rotary Club met May 28 virtually with an amazing bagged lunch\nprovided by the Colgate Inn.\n\nFirst on the agenda was a surprise birthday singalong for our foreign exchange\nstudent, Augustina, led by incoming club president Lorna Wilson. Augustina\nsaid she will miss Hamilton but after her two-week quarantine on arrival she\nis excited to see her family and friends in Argentina!\n\nTim Mansfield presented Friday Colgate University. He stated that we are lucky\nto have the incredible leadership of president Brian Casey and two task forces\nworking very long hours to make the many complicated decisions they face. Tim\nsaid the school after refunding students gave an option to support Hamilton,\nwhich many did by donating to the small business fund of the Partnership for\nCommunity Development.\n\nColgate, as stated by Hamilton Central School superintendent Bill Dowsland,\nalso supported the school and gave much needed technology for students to\nfinish online. Through the Hamilton Initiative they have also tried helping\nbusinesses with rent relief.\n\nMansfield said that though it is still unclear, the task forces are taking\nevery precaution and considering every effect of what will happen in the fall.\n\nThe club enjoyed the singing, the presentation, the food and the words from\nPastor Bill while visiting each other. We plan to announce our donation from\nRotary mug sales to Community Memorial next week and announce the service who\nwill be supported in the month of June.\n\nNew members are welcome to come join the group. Although meeting virtually\nnow, the Hamilton Rotary Club normally meets at noon every Thursday at the\nColgate Inn, 1 Payne St. in Hamilton.",

    "html": "<p><org>The Hamilton Rotary Club</org> met <chron>May 28</chron> virtually with an amazing bagged lunch provided by the <location>Colgate Inn</location>.</p>\n<p>First on the agenda was a surprise birthday singalong for our foreign exchange student, Augustina, led by incoming club president <person>Lorna Wilson</person>. Augustina said she will miss Hamilton but after her two-week quarantine on arrival she is excited to see her family and friends in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ar\">Argentina</location>!</p>\n\n<p><person>Tim Mansfield</person> presented <org>Friday Colgate University</org>. He stated that we are lucky to have the incredible leadership of president <person>Brian Casey</person> and two task forces working very long hours to make the many complicated decisions they face. Tim said the school after refunding students gave an option to support Hamilton, which many did by donating to the small business fund of the <org>Partnership for Community Development</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Colgate, as stated by <org>Hamilton Central School</org> superintendent <person>Bill Dowsland</person>, also supported the school and gave much needed technology for students to finish online. Through the Hamilton Initiative they have also tried helping businesses with rent relief.</p>\n\n<p>Mansfield said that though it is still unclear, the task forces are taking every precaution and considering every effect of what will happen in the fall.</p>\n\n<p>The club enjoyed the singing, the presentation, the food and the words from <person>Pastor Bill</person> while visiting each other. We plan to announce our donation from <org>Rotary</org> mug sales to Community Memorial next week and announce the service who will be supported in the month of June.</p>\n\n<p>    New members are welcome to come join the group. Although meeting virtually now, the <org>Hamilton Rotary Club</org> normally meets at noon every Thursday at the <location>Colgate Inn</location>, <location>1 Payne St.</location> in Hamilton.</p>",
