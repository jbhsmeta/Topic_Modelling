(Flower Mound, TX); Hernandez,\nAnnette G. (Keller, TX); Nasit, Gaurav H. (Irving, TX); Piemonti, Paul I. P.\n(Fort Worth, TX).\n\nThis patent was filed on February 14, 2019 and was published online on June 8,\n2020.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents\nobtained the following quote: \"Large corporations, particularly in the service\nindustries, typically interact with thousands of customers on a given day.\nPositive customer experiences facilitate long-term business relationships and\nare desirable for profitability. As a result, service companies, for example\nairlines, financial institutions, and the like, typically seek new approaches\nfor interacting with customers and innovative ways to reduce response times\n(for example, reduced phone support queues, faster reply time to customer\ntweets, etc.) and/or improve customer satisfaction (e.g., optimizing existing\nprocesses).\n\n\"Current technology enables customer-company interaction across a wide variety\nof systems and platforms, including but not limited to telephone, email,\ninstant messaging, text messaging, video teleconferencing, social media\npostings, and/or the like. Consistent, prompt, helpful customer service\nremains desirable, regardless of the customer interaction platform. In\nparticular, social networks and communications therein offer wide exposure and\ncorresponding opportunity to demonstrate excellent customer service to a wider\naudience than a one-on-one phone call, email chain, or the like. Accordingly,\nimproved social network assistance systems and/or tools remain desirable. For\nexample, systems and methods capable of managing a microblogging (e.g.,\n'twitter') stream in connection with a high volume of stream activity are\ndesirable.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also\nobtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"In an exemplary\nembodiment, a method for social network management comprises: receiving, at a\nsocial network assistance system, a tweet associated with a social media\naccount; locking the tweet so that only one social network assistance system\nuser may interact with that tweet; displaying the content of the tweet for\nevaluation; receiving, responsive to the evaluation, a response to the tweet;\nand submitting, to a social network associated with the social media account,\nthe response to the tweet.\n\n\"In another exemplary embodiment, a method for social network management\ncomprises: receiving, at a social network assistance system, a tweet\nassociated with a social media account; identifying, via the social network\nassistance system, the author of the tweet as an individual having an elevated\npriority; escalating the priority of the tweet within the social network\nassistance system to facilitate more rapid response to the tweet; evaluating,\nvia the social network assistance system, the content of the tweet to\nfacilitate preparation of a response; and submitting, via the social network\nassistance system, the response to the tweet.\n\n\"In another exemplary embodiment, a method for social network management\ncomprises: receiving, at a social network assistance system, a tweet\nassociated with a social media account; flagging, in the social network\nassistance system, the tweet for response by a particular user of the social\nnetwork assistance system; evaluating, via the social network assistance\nsystem, the content of the tweet; preparing a response to the tweet; and\nsubmitting, via the social network assistance system, the response to the\ntweet.\n\n\"In still another exemplary embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable\nstorage medium has computer-executable instructions stored thereon that, in\nresponse to execution by a computer system for social network assistance,\ncauses the computer system to perform operations comprising: receiving a tweet\nassociated with a social media account; locking the tweet so that only one\ncomputer system user may interact with that tweet; displaying, to a user of\nthe computer system, the content of the tweet for evaluation; receiving, from\nthe user of the computer system and responsive to the evaluation, a response\nto the tweet; and submitting, to a social network associated with the social\nmedia account, the response to the tweet.\n\n\"The contents of this summary section are provided only as a simplified\nintroduction to the disclosure, and are not intended to be used to limit the\nscope of the appended claims.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"What is claimed is:\n\n\"1\\.

Positive customer experiences facilitate long-term business relationships and are desirable for profitability. As a result, service companies, for example airlines, financial institutions, and the like, typically seek new approaches for interacting with customers and innovative ways to reduce response times (for example, reduced phone support queues, faster reply time to customer tweets, etc.) and/or improve customer satisfaction (e.g., optimizing existing processes).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Current technology enables customer-company interaction across a wide variety of systems and platforms, including but not limited to telephone, email, instant messaging, text messaging, video teleconferencing, social media postings, and/or the like. Consistent, prompt, helpful customer service remains desirable, regardless of the customer interaction platform. In particular, social networks and communications therein offer wide exposure and corresponding opportunity to demonstrate excellent customer service to a wider audience than a one-on-one phone call, email chain, or the like. Accordingly, improved social network assistance systems and/or tools remain desirable. For example, systems and methods capable of managing a microblogging (e.g., &#8216;twitter&#8217;) stream in connection with a high volume of stream activity are desirable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;In an exemplary embodiment, a method for social network management comprises: receiving, at a social network assistance system, a tweet associated with a social media account; locking the tweet so that only one social network assistance system user may interact with that tweet; displaying the content of the tweet for evaluation; receiving, responsive to the evaluation, a response to the tweet; and submitting, to a social network associated with the social media account, the response to the tweet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In another exemplary embodiment, a method for social network management comprises: receiving, at a social network assistance system, a tweet associated with a social media account; identifying, via the social network assistance system, the author of the tweet as an individual having an elevated priority; escalating the priority of the tweet within the social network assistance system to facilitate more rapid response to the tweet; evaluating, via the social network assistance system, the content of the tweet to facilitate preparation of a response; and submitting, via the social network assistance system, the response to the tweet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In another exemplary embodiment, a method for social network management comprises: receiving, at a social network assistance system, a tweet associated with a social media account; flagging, in the social network assistance system, the tweet for response by a particular user of the social network assistance system; evaluating, via the social network assistance system, the content of the tweet; preparing a response to the tweet; and submitting, via the social network assistance system, the response to the tweet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In still another exemplary embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium has computer-executable instructions stored thereon that, in response to execution by a computer system for social network assistance, causes the computer system to perform operations comprising: receiving a tweet associated with a social media account; locking the tweet so that only one computer system user may interact with that tweet; displaying, to a user of the computer system, the content of the tweet for evaluation; receiving, from the user of the computer system and responsive to the evaluation, a response to the tweet; and submitting, to a social network associated with the social media account, the response to the tweet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The contents of this summary section are provided only as a simplified introduction to the disclosure, and are not intended to be used to limit the scope of the appended claims.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is claimed is:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
