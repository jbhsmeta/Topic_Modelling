    "text": "The August 2019 death of Elijah McClain after being accosted by Aurora police\nofficers is hardly the only Colorado case involving a young African American\nmale that echoes the tragic killing of George Floyd.\n\nThat same month, nineteen-year-old De'Von Bailey was fatally shot in the back\nby Colorado Springs police officers while he was running away - and while\nFloyd's name doesn't appear in a just-filed lawsuit over the incident, the\nparallels are chillingly clear.\n\nAttorney Darold Killmer of Denver-based Killmer, Lane & Newman, LLP, the firm\nrepresenting Bailey's family, emphasizes that \"the timing of our filing isn't\nrelated to the George Floyd events. Our game plan had been to file around now\nall along and the George Floyd events coincidentally occurred - although it's\nactually less than a coincidence, because this happens again and again and\nagain.\"\n\nHe adds: \"What happened to George Floyd has captured all of our attention, but\nthe idea of a black man killed at the hands of a police officer is nothing\nnew, and that's one of our biggest problems. Our country's become acutely\naware of racially biased policing because of the events in Minneapolis, but\nthis problem didn't just begin. It's happened for generations, and when De'Von\nBailey was killed last August, he became yet another young black man in a line\nof police brutality victims.\"\n\nColorado Springs isn't commenting on the lawsuit.\n\nUnlike the McClain matter, during which the body cameras of the officers\ninvolved were dislodged (accidentally, they insist, although lawyer Mari\nNewman, Killmer's partner, doubts that), there's video of Bailey's death as\ndisturbing in its own way as the footage that caught Floyd's terrible final\nmoments. But extenuating circumstances, including a concealed weapon,\nprevented the images from garnering the national attention they deserved.\n\nMarijuana Deals Near You\n\nOn August 3, Sergeant Alan Van't Land and officer Blake Evenson, both of whom\nare defendants in the lawsuit along with the City of Colorado Springs,\nresponded to a soon-to-be-disputed report of an attempted robbery on the 2400\nblock of East Fountain Boulevard. There, they encountered Bailey and his\nnineteen-year-old cousin Lawrence Stoker, who was later cleared of any\nwrongdoing. During the exchange, Bailey took off running, likely because he\nhad a gun \"deeply embedded within his basketball shorts,\" as Killmer describes\nit.\n\nHere's a video that compiles the body-camera footage of Van't Land and\nEvenson, preceded by 911 audio. The Van't Land material gets under way at\naround the ten-minute point, while Evenson's starts at about 12:30. (Warning:\nThe imagery is extremely graphic.)\n\nIn the clip, Bailey can be seen reaching for his pocket at least twice during\nhis interactions with Van't Land and Evenson. Early on in the Van't Land\nfootage, he shifts his hand in that direction and begins trying to snake his\nfingers into the opening in the fabric, only to immediately move both hands\naway from his body and then raise them over his head after being ordered to do\nso. In the Evenson material, Bailey appears to be moving a hand toward the\npocket again while sprinting away from the officers, only to quickly abandon\nthe effort when it becomes clear that getting access to it is impossible.\n\nThe bottom line: Bailey never came close to grabbing the gun, much less aiming\nit at Van't Land and Evenson. \"They discovered he had a gun after they shot\nhim and were searching him - and even they couldn't reach it. They had to cut\nit out,\" Killmer notes. \"So it was happenstance that he had a gun, and it\ndoesn't justify using deadly force. The courts are clear on this. If he had\nbrandished the gun or threatened someone with it or even said, 'I have a gun\nand I'm going to shoot you,' that might have given the officers justification\nto use deadly force. But as it was, this was two African American men and one\nof them ran away - and in order to stop him from getting away, they shot him,\nwhich is unconstitutional under clear case law.\"\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced in March that it wouldn't\ncriminally charge Van't Land and Everson for their actions. Hence, the\nlawsuit.\n\n\"The nub of the case is that with somebody who didn't fit the profile of\nDe'Von Bailey \\- a young, black man - it's probable that police wouldn't have\nresorted to just pulling their guns and shooting him in the way they did,\"\nKillmer says. \"Assumptions and stereotypes, even if they didn't consciously\nunderstand them, led them to immediately escalate to deadly force when he was\nrunning away from police. I think the cops immediately detected that they\ncouldn't catch him, so to apprehend him, they shot him in the back three\ntimes, killing him. If it had been a person of another socioeconomic status -\nsomeone not African American \\- it definitely would have turned out\ndifferently.\"\n\nAs for why Colorado Springs is also targeted in the complaint, Killmer points\nout that \"the contrast between how authorities reacted in the George Floyd\ncase could not be more stark. The officers in the George Floyd case were\nterminated the day after it happened, and although it took three or four days\nfor charges to be filed against the officer most directly responsible, charges\nwere filed and later enhanced - and the officers involved in helping that\nofficer kill him have now also been charged.\"\n\nIn his view, \"that's the way it's supposed to work: The people who killed\nGeorge Floyd will be held criminally culpable if they meet the elements of the\ncrime. But none of that happened in De'Von Bailey's case. In fact, the\nopposite happened. The district attorney and the city circled their wagons to\nprotect the officers. They ducked and dodged and only provided the information\nthey wanted the public to see. They still haven't provided us with all the\ninformation we've asked for. So it's been very much a whitewash - an unhealthy\nand, I feel, illegal response from the city. It's the opposite of what\nhappened in Minneapolis.\"\n\nThe ongoing demonstrations over George Floyd's death and the public's reaction\nas a whole \"gives me hope that people will realize that this systemic racism\nis baked into our law enforcement agencies,\" Killmer concludes. \"That's not to\nsay all police are racist. But it is to say many of them are, and the\nagencies' response to these kinds of tragedies has been woefully inadequate\nfor generations. That's why we filed this suit.\"\n\nClick to read the Estate of De'Von Bailey v. City of Colorado Springs, et al.",

    "title": "George Floyd Echoes in Lawsuit Over Fatal Shooting of De'Von Bailey",
    "html": "<p>The <chron>August 2019</chron> death of <person>Elijah McClain</person> after being accosted by Aurora police officers is hardly the only <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location> case involving a young <org>African American</org> male that echoes the tragic killing of <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n<p>That same month, nineteen-year-old <person>De'Von Bailey</person> was fatally shot in the back by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.clsprg\">Colorado Springs</location> police officers while he was running away - and while Floyd's name doesn't appear in a just-filed lawsuit over the incident, the parallels are chillingly clear.</p>\n\n<p>Attorney <person>Darold Killmer</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>-based <org>Killmer, Lane &amp; Newman, LLP</org>, the firm representing Bailey's family, emphasizes that \"the timing of our filing isn't related to the George Floyd events. Our game plan had been to file around now all along and the George Floyd events coincidentally occurred - although it's actually less than a coincidence, because this happens again and again and again.\"</p>\n\n<p>He adds: \"What happened to <person>George Floyd</person> has captured all of our attention, but the idea of a black man killed at the hands of a police officer is nothing new, and that's one of our biggest problems. Our country's become acutely aware of racially biased policing because of the events in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location>, but this problem didn't just begin. It's happened for generations, and when <person>De'Von Bailey</person> was killed last August, he became yet another young black man in a line of police brutality victims.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.clsprg\">Colorado Springs</location> isn't commenting on the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the McClain matter, during which the body cameras of the officers involved were dislodged (accidentally, they insist, although lawyer <person>Mari Newman</person>, Killmer's partner, doubts that), there's video of Bailey's death as disturbing in its own way as the footage that caught Floyd's terrible final moments. But extenuating circumstances, including a concealed weapon, prevented the images from garnering the national attention they deserved.</p>\n\n<p>Marijuana Deals Near You</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>August 3</chron>, Sergeant <person>Alan Van't Land</person> and officer <person>Blake Evenson</person>, both of whom are defendants in the lawsuit along with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.clsprg\">City of Colorado Springs</location>, responded to a soon-to-be-disputed report of an attempted robbery on the 2400 block of <location>East Fountain Boulevard</location>. There, they encountered Bailey and his nineteen-year-old cousin <person>Lawrence Stoker</person>, who was later cleared of any wrongdoing. During the exchange, Bailey took off running, likely because he had a gun \"deeply embedded within his basketball shorts,\" as Killmer describes it.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a video that compiles the body-camera footage of Van't Land and Evenson, preceded by 911 audio. The Van't Land material gets under way at around the ten-minute point, while Evenson's starts at about 12:30. (Warning: The imagery is extremely graphic.)</p>\n\n<p>In the clip, Bailey can be seen reaching for his pocket at least twice during his interactions with Van't Land and Evenson. Early on in the Van't Land footage, he shifts his hand in that direction and begins trying to snake his fingers into the opening in the fabric, only to immediately move both hands away from his body and then raise them over his head after being ordered to do so. In the Evenson material, Bailey appears to be moving a hand toward the pocket again while sprinting away from the officers, only to quickly abandon the effort when it becomes clear that getting access to it is impossible.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line: Bailey never came close to grabbing the gun, much less aiming it at Van't Land and Evenson. \"They discovered he had a gun after they shot him and were searching him - and even they couldn't reach it. They had to cut it out,\" Killmer notes. \"So it was happenstance that he had a gun, and it doesn't justify using deadly force. The courts are clear on this. If he had brandished the gun or threatened someone with it or even said, 'I have a gun and I'm going to shoot you,' that might have given the officers justification to use deadly force. But as it was, this was two <org>African American</org> men and one of them ran away - and in order to stop him from getting away, they shot him, which is unconstitutional under clear case law.\"</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the <org>U.S. Attorney's Office</org> announced in March that it wouldn't criminally charge Van't Land and Everson for their actions. Hence, the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>\"The nub of the case is that with somebody who didn't fit the profile of <person>De'Von Bailey</person> - a young, black man - it's probable that police wouldn't have resorted to just pulling their guns and shooting him in the way they did,\" Killmer says. \"Assumptions and stereotypes, even if they didn't consciously understand them, led them to immediately escalate to deadly force when he was running away from police. I think the cops immediately detected that they couldn't catch him, so to apprehend him, they shot him in the back three times, killing him. If it had been a person of another socioeconomic status - someone not <org>African American</org> - it definitely would have turned out differently.\"</p>\n\n<p>As for why <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.clsprg\">Colorado Springs</location> is also targeted in the complaint, Killmer points out that \"the contrast between how authorities reacted in the George Floyd case could not be more stark. The officers in the George Floyd case were terminated the day after it happened, and although it took three or four days for charges to be filed against the officer most directly responsible, charges were filed and later enhanced - and the officers involved in helping that officer kill him have now also been charged.\"</p>\n\n<p>In his view, \"that's the way it's supposed to work: The people who killed <person>George Floyd</person> will be held criminally culpable if they meet the elements of the crime. But none of that happened in <person>De'Von Bailey's</person> case. In fact, the opposite happened. The district attorney and the city circled their wagons to protect the officers. They ducked and dodged and only provided the information they wanted the public to see. They still haven't provided us with all the information we've asked for. So it's been very much a whitewash - an unhealthy and, I feel, illegal response from the city. It's the opposite of what happened in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location>.\"</p>\n\n<p>The ongoing demonstrations over <person>George Floyd's</person> death and the public's reaction as a whole \"gives me hope that people will realize that this systemic racism is baked into our law enforcement agencies,\" Killmer concludes. \"That's not to say all police are racist. But it is to say many of them are, and the agencies' response to these kinds of tragedies has been woefully inadequate for generations. That's why we filed this suit.\"</p>\n\n<p>Click to read the Estate of <person>De'Von Bailey</person> v. <location>City of Colorado Springs</location>, et al.</p>",
