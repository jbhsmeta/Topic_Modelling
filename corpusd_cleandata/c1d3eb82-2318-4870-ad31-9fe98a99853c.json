    "text": "The thought of a casino in Schoolfield causes excitement for resident Evelyn\nLowe, who worked at Dan River Inc. and has lived in the neighborhood for about\n50 years.\n\nDANVILLE \\- The thought of a casino in Schoolfield causes excitement for\nresident Evelyn Lowe, who worked at Dan River Inc. and has lived in the\nneighborhood for about 50 years.\n\n\"I'm all for it,\" Lowe, 75, said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThough many Danville residents do not have the money to spend on gambling,\npeople from surrounding areas \"will be coming here in buses,\" she said.\nBesides, she added, the project would mean more jobs.\n\nBut another Schoolfield resident, 74-year-old Richard Chandler, is not so\nsupportive of the idea.\n\n\"I don't approve of it,\" said the Schoolfield resident who's lived in the\nneighborhood for more than 40 years. \"It shouldn't be here. I just think it's\ngoing to cause more problems than it's worth.\"\n\nDanville City Council passed a resolution Tuesday night officially selecting\nCaesars Entertainment as the city's preferred casino provider. Whether the\ncompany brings a gambling resort to Danville depends on the outcome of a\nreferendum among city voters in November.\n\nCouncil voted 8-0 - which was held remotely via Zoom - to pass a resolution to\nchoose Caesars from among four finalists. Councilman Madison Whittle was\nabsent due to internet problems.\n\nThe resolution was added to the agenda at the start of the meeting. It\nauthorizes the city manager to execute a non-binding letter of intent with\nCaesars, headquartered in Paradise, Nevada.\n\nThough no discussion was held before the vote, Councilman Fred Shanks pointed\nout during end-of-the-meeting communications from councilmen and other city\nofficials that a lot of effort went into attracting Caesars to Danville.\n\n\"It's very important to understand how much work was done behind the scenes,\"\nShanks said.\n\nA representative with Caesars said the company was happy with the city's\ndecision.\n\n\"Caesars Entertainment is very pleased to have been selected and we look\nforward to making the city proud of its decision to choose Caesars to develop\nand operate the resort and casino,\" said Jacqueline Grace, vice president and\ngeneral manager at Horseshoe Baltimore, which is owned by Caesars. \"We are\ncommitted to the communities in which we operate and can't wait to welcome our\nneighbors.\"\n\nUnder casino legislation adopted by the Virginia General Assembly, the city\nmust submit its preferred casino gaming operator to the Virginia Lottery\nBoard, which would have 45 days to decide whether to approve the city's\nchoice, said Danville City Manager Ken Larking.\n\nOnce the Lottery Board approves the city's selection and notifies local\nofficials, the city will ask the circuit court if a referendum can be put on\nthe ballot, Larking said.\n\nCaesars and the city must still work out an agreement.\n\n\"We don't have a definitive agreement, but we're working out the details of\none,\" Larking said. \"It has not been finalized yet.\"\n\nCaesars was the lead contender from among four finalists - seven companies had\ninitially responded to the city's request for proposals issued in December -\nhoping to bring a casino resort to Danville. City officials and a\nrepresentative from the company announced during an event at the Schoolfield\nsite May 18 that Danville leaders were in negotiations with Caesars for a\npossible project there.\n\nA casino development at Schoolfield - the property that currently includes the\nformer Dan River Inc. finishing building - would bring more traffic to that\npart of the city and attract additional businesses, officials have said.\n\nIf voters approve a casino in Danville, Caesars would be expected to invest\nmore than $400 million and create 1,300 jobs with competitive benefits\npackages and average pay between $35,000 and $47,000 annually, officials\nannounced May 18 at the Schoolfield site.\n\nThe project is projected to bring $34 million in annual revenue for Danville.\nOf that, more than $30 million would come from gaming taxes and supplemental\npayments to the city, and $4 million would be generated from real estate,\nmeals, sales and lodging taxes.\n\nAlso, Caesars' proposal includes at least $20 million in upfront payments to\nthe city to cover land acquisition and other public investments.\n\nThe company has plans to build a facility with 500 hotel rooms, a\n35,000-square-foot conference center, a 2,500-seat live entertainment venue,\nrestaurants and bars, 2,000 slot machines, 75 table games, 16 poker tables and\na sportsbook to wager on various sports competitions.\n\nThe project is expected to be complete in 2023 and is anticipated to generate\n900 construction jobs.\n\n\"Caesars Entertainment looks forward to engaging more with the Danville\ncommunity, businesses and constituents to further demonstrate the positive\neconomic and tourism impacts that our project will bring to the community,\"\nGrace said. \"Additionally, we will begin our initial phases of predevelopment\nand planning for the Schoolfield site.\"\n\nSchoolfield is significant as one of the largest textile mill villages in\nVirginia and the South. The village was founded as an independent company town\nin 1903 by Dan River Inc., which owned all the houses and other buildings in\nthe town. The city of Danville annexed Schoolfield in 1951.\n\nThe industrial site in Schoolfield covers about 85 acres and roughly 700,000\nsquare feet of structures, including the 617,000-square-foot former finishing\nplant, which can be seen from West Main Street in Schoolfield.\n\nCrane reports for the Register & Bee.

    "html": "<p>The thought of a casino in Schoolfield causes excitement for resident <person>Evelyn Lowe</person>, who worked at <org>Dan River Inc.</org> and has lived in the neighborhood for about 50 years.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">DANVILLE</location> - The thought of a casino in Schoolfield causes excitement for resident <person>Evelyn Lowe</person>, who worked at <org>Dan River Inc.</org> and has lived in the neighborhood for about 50 years.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm all for it,\" Lowe, 75, said Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Though many <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location> residents do not have the money to spend on gambling, people from surrounding areas \"will be coming here in buses,\" she said. Besides, she added, the project would mean more jobs.</p>\n\n<p>But another Schoolfield resident, 74-year-old <person>Richard Chandler</person>, is not so supportive of the idea.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't approve of it,\" said the Schoolfield resident who's lived in the neighborhood for more than 40 years. \"It shouldn't be here. I just think it's going to cause more problems than it's worth.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>Danville City Council</org> passed a resolution Tuesday night officially selecting <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:CZR\">Caesars Entertainment</org> as the city's preferred casino provider. Whether the company brings a gambling resort to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location> depends on the outcome of a referendum among city voters in November.</p>\n\n<p>Council voted 8-0 - which was held remotely via Zoom - to pass a resolution to choose Caesars from among four finalists. Councilman <person>Madison Whittle</person> was absent due to internet problems.</p>\n\n<p>The resolution was added to the agenda at the start of the meeting. It authorizes the city manager to execute a non-binding letter of intent with Caesars, headquartered in Paradise, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nv\">Nevada</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Though no discussion was held before the vote, Councilman <person>Fred Shanks</person> pointed out during end-of-the-meeting communications from councilmen and other city officials that a lot of effort went into attracting Caesars to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's very important to understand how much work was done behind the scenes,\" Shanks said.</p>\n\n<p>A representative with Caesars said the company was happy with the city's decision.</p>\n\n<p>\"<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:CZR\">Caesars Entertainment</org> is very pleased to have been selected and we look forward to making the city proud of its decision to choose Caesars to develop and operate the resort and casino,\" said <person>Jacqueline Grace</person>, vice president and general manager at Horseshoe Baltimore, which is owned by Caesars. \"We are committed to the communities in which we operate and can't wait to welcome our neighbors.\"</p>\n\n<p>Under casino legislation adopted by the <org>Virginia General Assembly</org>, the city must submit its preferred casino gaming operator to the Virginia Lottery Board, which would have 45 days to decide whether to approve the city's choice, said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danity\">Danville City</location> Manager <person>Ken Larking</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Lottery Board approves the city's selection and notifies local officials, the city will ask the circuit court if a referendum can be put on the ballot, Larking said.</p>\n\n<p>Caesars and the city must still work out an agreement.</p>\n\n<p>\"We don't have a definitive agreement, but we're working out the details of one,\" Larking said. \"It has not been finalized yet.\"</p>\n\n<p>Caesars was the lead contender from among four finalists - seven companies had initially responded to the city's request for proposals issued in December - hoping to bring a casino resort to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danity\">Danville. City</location> officials and a representative from the company announced during an event at the Schoolfield site <chron>May 18</chron> that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location> leaders were in negotiations with Caesars for a possible project there.</p>\n\n<p>A casino development at Schoolfield - the property that currently includes the former Dan River Inc. finishing building - would bring more traffic to that part of the city and attract additional businesses, officials have said.</p>\n\n<p>If voters approve a casino in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location>, Caesars would be expected to invest more than <money>$400 million</money> and create 1,300 jobs with competitive benefits packages and average pay between <money>$35,000</money> and <money>$47,000</money> annually, officials announced <chron>May 18</chron> at the Schoolfield site.</p>\n\n<p>The project is projected to bring <money>$34 million</money> in annual revenue for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location>. Of that, more than <money>$30 million</money> would come from gaming taxes and supplemental payments to the city, and <money>$4 million</money> would be generated from real estate, meals, sales and lodging taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Caesars' proposal includes at least <money>$20 million</money> in upfront payments to the city to cover land acquisition and other public investments.</p>\n\n<p>The company has plans to build a facility with 500 hotel rooms, a 35,000-square-foot conference center, a 2,500-seat live entertainment venue, restaurants and bars, 2,000 slot machines, 75 table games, 16 poker tables and a sportsbook to wager on various sports competitions.</p>\n\n<p>The project is expected to be complete in 2023 and is anticipated to generate 900 construction jobs.</p>\n\n<p>\"<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:CZR\">Caesars Entertainment</org> looks forward to engaging more with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location> community, businesses and constituents to further demonstrate the positive economic and tourism impacts that our project will bring to the community,\" Grace said. \"Additionally, we will begin our initial phases of predevelopment and planning for the Schoolfield site.\"</p>\n\n<p>Schoolfield is significant as one of the largest textile mill villages in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> and the South. The village was founded as an independent company town in 1903 by <org>Dan River Inc.</org>, which owned all the houses and other buildings in the town. The city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.danlle\">Danville</location> annexed Schoolfield in 1951.</p>\n\n<p>The industrial site in Schoolfield covers about 85 acres and roughly 700,000 square feet of structures, including the 617,000-square-foot former finishing plant, which can be seen from <location>West Main Street</location> in Schoolfield.</p>\n\n<p>Crane reports for the Register &amp; Bee.
