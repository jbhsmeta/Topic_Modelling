    "text": "A truck with the El Shaddai Food Ministry of the Crystal River Church of God\ndrove up to the Community Food Bank of Citrus County in Homosassa to pick up a\nfreight of goods.\n\nAs it traveled on a driveway around the nonprofit's building on the afternoon\nof Monday, June 8, 2020, the vehicle was blocked by a parked truck belonging\nto the We Care Food Pantry Inc.\n\nThe truck reversed to take another route that loops around the property at\n5259 W. Cardinal St., but the truck was stopped there as well by a barricade\nof pallets in the road.\n\nA worker with We Care sat in a forklift behind the line of wooden columns,\nstacked roughly 3 feet high.\n\nHe gave a warm greeting to the truck's crew, people he's met before during\ntheir many deliveries with the community food bank (CFBCC).\n\nA forklift driver with CFBCC appeared from inside the organization's warehouse\nto load food onto the ministry's truck, steering around the barriers placed\nthere at around noon.\n\nCFBCC Executive Director Barbara Sprague walked to We Care's neighboring\nbuilding to ask her group's landlord to move the barrier for her client's\ntruck.\n\nOther vehicles, from semitrailers to pickup trucks hauling trailers, also\nbegan lining up.\n\nWe Care's board president, Jeanmarie Dunk, and its founder/vice president,\nDiane Toto, agreed to Sprague's request.\n\nAfter the food ministry's truck was loaded, We Care's forklift driver lifted a\npallet out of its way to pass.\n\nWe Care officials said this has to be the new normal for CFBCC until it learns\nto abide to its lease and make all its food deliveries at the property's\nshared loading dock.\n\n\"We're blocking them off; we've had enough.\" Toto told a Chronicle reporter.\n\"I hate this drastic option  but why can't they use the loading dock?\"\n\nSprague said We Care will not slow CFBCC from getting between 100,000 and\n200,000 pounds of food to roughly 50 community pantries in the area a week.\n\n\"We're going to continue to work through this in anyway we can,\" she said,\nafter calling the fire marshal to check if We Care's blockades were allowed in\ncase first responders or evacuees needed to enter or leave the property in\ncase of an emergency.\n\nSprague said she's also concerned how the barriers might interrupt possible\nfood distributions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which uses\nCFBCC as a supply hub for Citrus, Hernando and Sumter counties if disaster\nstrikes.\n\n\"Those are state and federal mandated missions,\" Sprague said. \"There has to\nbe a direct connection.\"\n\nThis conflict between We Care and CFBCC over the loading dock and restricted\nparking entered Citrus County Civil Court in November 2019, when We Care filed\na lawsuit to evict CFBCC, which has been We Care's tenant and neighbor since\n2013.\n\nA lease agreement between the nonprofits was automatically renewed in March\n2020 for 10 years, according to CFBCC board member Jewel Lamb, who arrived\nJune 8 to support Sprague.\n\nLamb said she sat on We Care's board when it raised funds to purchase and\ndevelop the property before We Care opened its doors there in July 2012.\n\n\"It's just a real shame what's going on,\" she said.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, We Care attorney Bill Grant sent CFBCC's lawyers with Foley &\nLardner LLP an email, stating barriers would go up at 12:01 p.m. Monday, June\n8, to separate We Care's and CFBCC's buildings.\n\nIf the food bank needs access to the loading dock attached to We Care's\nbuilding, it can use it between 8 a.m. and noon Mondays, Wednesdays and\nFridays.\n\nIf CFBCC needs additional time, its staff must contact We Care to make\narrangements.\n\n\"No one is going to impact business,\" Toto said. \"We don't want to impact\nbusiness.\"\n\nToto and Dunk said they're upset with CFBCC, claiming its vehicles crowd the\nentire lot and purposefully block We Care's trucks from moving.\n\n\"It's not fair for them to say we're impacting their business when they're\nimpacting our business,\" Dunk said.\n\nSprague said not all the agencies CFBCC feeds under a contract with Feeding\nTampa Bay of Feeding America, have commercial trucks to work with an\nindustrial loading dock.\n\n\"If a car were to back up into that, it would be far too low,\" she said.\n\nCFBCC attorneys sent a proposal to We Care, offering to have a loading zone\nstriped on the north side of the food bank's building to better accommodate\nsmaller vehicles picking up food.\n\nToto and Dunk said a new loading area would bring more traffic and force CFBCC\nto travel farther from its warehouse doors to load a delivery.\n\n\"There's no reason why they can't use the loading dock,\" Dunk said.\n\nSprague said CFBCC will no longer provide food to We Care after Feeding Tampa\nBay ordered her to stop because of We Care's actions and the food-safety\nviolations it was cited for on May 21, 2020.\n\nFeeding Tampa Bay could not be reached for comment.\n\nAn inspector with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services\ncited We Care for unsanitary food storage and signs of rats in proximity to\nits food pallets.\n\nToto said contracted cleaners took care of the issues, and We Care is ready\nfor another inspection later in June.\n\n\"We've completed everything on the list,\" she said. \"This was a new problem.\"",

    "html": "<p>A truck with the <org>El Shaddai Food Ministry</org> of the <org>Crystal River Church of God</org> drove up to the <org>Community Food Bank of Citrus County</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.homssa\">Homosassa</location> to pick up a freight of goods.</p>\n<p>As it traveled on a driveway around the nonprofit's building on the afternoon of <chron>Monday, June 8, 2020</chron>, the vehicle was blocked by a parked truck belonging to the <org>We Care Food Pantry Inc.</org></p>\n\n<p>The truck reversed to take another route that loops around the property at <location>5259 W. Cardinal St.</location>, but the truck was stopped there as well by a barricade of pallets in the road.</p>\n\n<p>A worker with We Care sat in a forklift behind the line of wooden columns, stacked roughly 3 feet high.</p>\n\n<p>He gave a warm greeting to the truck's crew, people he's met before during their many deliveries with the community food bank (CFBCC).</p>\n\n<p>A forklift driver with CFBCC appeared from inside the organization's warehouse to load food onto the ministry's truck, steering around the barriers placed there at around noon.</p>\n\n<p>CFBCC Executive Director <person>Barbara Sprague</person> walked to We Care's neighboring building to ask her group's landlord to move the barrier for her client's truck.</p>\n\n<p>Other vehicles, from semitrailers to pickup trucks hauling trailers, also began lining up.</p>\n\n<p>We Care's board president, <person>Jeanmarie Dunk</person>, and its founder/vice president, <person>Diane Toto</person>, agreed to Sprague's request.</p>\n\n<p>After the food ministry's truck was loaded, We Care's forklift driver lifted a pallet out of its way to pass.</p>\n\n<p>We Care officials said this has to be the new normal for CFBCC until it learns to abide to its lease and make all its food deliveries at the property's shared loading dock.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're blocking them off; we've had enough.\" Toto told a Chronicle reporter. \"I hate this drastic option &#133; but why can't they use the loading dock?\"</p>\n\n<p>Sprague said We Care will not slow CFBCC from getting between 100,000 and 200,000 pounds of food to roughly 50 community pantries in the area a week.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're going to continue to work through this in anyway we can,\" she said, after calling the fire marshal to check if We Care's blockades were allowed in case first responders or evacuees needed to enter or leave the property in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>Sprague said she's also concerned how the barriers might interrupt possible food distributions from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3926532505\">Federal Emergency Management Agency</org>, which uses CFBCC as a supply hub for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.citrus\">Citrus</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.herndo\">Hernando</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.sumter\">Sumter</location> counties if disaster strikes.</p>\n\n<p>\"Those are state and federal mandated missions,\" Sprague said. \"There has to be a direct connection.\"</p>\n\n<p>This conflict between We Care and CFBCC over the loading dock and restricted parking entered Citrus County Civil Court in <chron>November 2019</chron>, when We Care filed a lawsuit to evict CFBCC, which has been We Care's tenant and neighbor since 2013.</p>\n\n<p>A lease agreement between the nonprofits was automatically renewed in <chron>March 2020</chron> for 10 years, according to CFBCC board member <person>Jewel Lamb</person>, who arrived <chron>June 8</chron> to support Sprague.</p>\n\n<p>Lamb said she sat on We Care's board when it raised funds to purchase and develop the property before We Care opened its doors there in <chron>July 2012</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's just a real shame what's going on,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>June 4, 2020</chron>, We Care attorney <person>Bill Grant</person> sent CFBCC's lawyers with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2750424157\">Foley &amp; Lardner LLP</org> an email, stating barriers would go up at <chron>12:01 p.m. Monday, June 8</chron>, to separate We Care's and CFBCC's buildings.</p>\n\n<p>If the food bank needs access to the loading dock attached to We Care's building, it can use it <chron>between 8 a.m. and noon Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>If CFBCC needs additional time, its staff must contact We Care to make arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>\"No one is going to impact business,\" Toto said. \"We don't want to impact business.\"</p>\n\n<p>Toto and Dunk said they're upset with CFBCC, claiming its vehicles crowd the entire lot and purposefully block We Care's trucks from moving.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not fair for them to say we're impacting their business when they're impacting our business,\" Dunk said.</p>\n\n<p>Sprague said not all the agencies CFBCC feeds under a contract with <location>Feeding Tampa Bay</location> of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3648299192\">Feeding America</org>, have commercial trucks to work with an industrial loading dock.</p>\n\n<p>\"If a car were to back up into that, it would be far too low,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>CFBCC attorneys sent a proposal to We Care, offering to have a loading zone striped on the north side of the food bank's building to better accommodate smaller vehicles picking up food.</p>\n\n<p>Toto and Dunk said a new loading area would bring more traffic and force CFBCC to travel farther from its warehouse doors to load a delivery.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's no reason why they can't use the loading dock,\" Dunk said.</p>\n\n<p>Sprague said CFBCC will no longer provide food to We Care after <location>Feeding Tampa Bay</location> ordered her to stop because of We Care's actions and the food-safety violations it was cited for on <chron>May 21, 2020</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Feeding <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.tambay\">Tampa Bay</location> could not be reached for comment.</p>\n\n<p>An inspector with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1756270388\">Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services</org> cited We Care for unsanitary food storage and signs of rats in proximity to its food pallets.</p>\n\n<p>Toto said contracted cleaners took care of the issues, and We Care is ready for another inspection later in June.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've completed everything on the list,\" she said. \"This was a new problem.\"</p>",
