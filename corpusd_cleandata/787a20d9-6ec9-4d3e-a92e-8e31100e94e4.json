    "text": "An accident involving a big rig that tipped over in the Santa Ynez Valley\ncaused the closure of westbound Highway 154 for several hours on Monday.\n\nAt approximately noon, personnel from the Santa Barbara County Fire Department\nand California Highway Patrol were dispatched to the scene at Highways 154 and\n246, County Fire Capt. Daniel Bertucelli said.\n\nA front tire on the tractor-trailer's cab reportedly blew out while the\nvehicle entered the roundabout, causing the vehicle to flip onto its side, he\nsaid.\n\nThe driver was uninjured, Bertucelli said.\n\nThe intermodal container truck was en route to Santa Maria from the Port of\nLos Angeles.\n\nThe crash led to a hazmat incident because some fluids from the 18-wheeler's\ncab neared storm drains in the area, Bertucelli said, but the fluids were\nquickly contained.\n\nHe said it was not known what the truck's container carried since it did not\nhave obvious placards claiming hazardous materials were aboard.\n\nHighway 154 was closed at Cathedral Oaks Road on the Santa Barbara side due to\nthe crash and cleanup, but local residents were allowed access.\n\nAuthorities did not say how long they expected the Highway 154 lanes to remain\nclosed.\n\n\\- Noozhawk North County editor Janene Scully can be reached at .(JavaScript\nmust be enabled to view this email address).

    "html": "<p>An accident involving a big rig that tipped over in the <location>Santa Ynez Valley</location> caused the closure of westbound <location>Highway 154</location> for several hours on Monday.</p>\n<p>At approximately noon, personnel from the <org>Santa Barbara County Fire Department</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1412814350\">California Highway Patrol</org> were dispatched to the scene at Highways 154 and 246, County Fire Capt. <person>Daniel Bertucelli</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>A front tire on the tractor-trailer's cab reportedly blew out while the vehicle entered the roundabout, causing the vehicle to flip onto its side, he said.</p>\n\n<p>The driver was uninjured, Bertucelli said.</p>\n\n<p>The intermodal container truck was en route to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanria\">Santa Maria</location> from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2622360416\">Port of Los Angeles</org>.</p>\n\n<p>The crash led to a hazmat incident because some fluids from the 18-wheeler's cab neared storm drains in the area, Bertucelli said, but the fluids were quickly contained.</p>\n\n<p>He said it was not known what the truck's container carried since it did not have obvious placards claiming hazardous materials were aboard.</p>\n\n<p><location>Highway 154</location> was closed at <location>Cathedral Oaks Road</location> on the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sntaba\">Santa Barbara</location> side due to the crash and cleanup, but local residents were allowed access.</p>\n\n<p>Authorities did not say how long they expected the <location>Highway 154</location> lanes to remain closed.</p>\n\n<p>- Noozhawk North County editor <person>Janene Scully</person> can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).
