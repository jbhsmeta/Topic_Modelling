Recently, image-based biometric information is\nincreasingly used for hacking, replication, and theft, and alternative\ntechnologies and anti-theft technologies are being developed.\n\n\"Unlike the biometric information based on the image, the biometric\ninformation using frequency domain transfer characteristics is relatively\ndifficult to replicate. Therefore, the biometric information using the\nfrequency domain transfer characteristics may be usefully used for the\npersonal authentication. Among the biometric information using the frequency\ndomain transfer characteristics, an auditory brainstem response (ABR) signal\nmay be used for the personal authentication.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this\npatent application: \"Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a personal\nauthentication device and a personal authentication method, based on an\nauditory brainstem response signal.\n\n\"According to an exemplary embodiment, a personal authentication device may\ninclude a signal generator, a signal acquirer, and a signal processor.

Recently, image-based biometric information is increasingly used for hacking, replication, and theft, and alternative technologies and anti-theft technologies are being developed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unlike the biometric information based on the image, the biometric information using frequency domain transfer characteristics is relatively difficult to replicate. Therefore, the biometric information using the frequency domain transfer characteristics may be usefully used for the personal authentication. Among the biometric information using the frequency domain transfer characteristics, an auditory brainstem response (ABR) signal may be used for the personal authentication.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;Embodiments of the inventive concept provide a personal authentication device and a personal authentication method, based on an auditory brainstem response signal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to an exemplary embodiment, a personal authentication device may include a signal generator, a signal acquirer, and a signal processor. The signal generator may output an auditory stimulus to an ear of a user, using a sound generator.

The signal processor may generate a first auditory brainstem response signal, based on the first reference potential and the first evoked potential, generate authentication data for the user from the first auditory brainstem response signal, and compare the authentication data with registration data to authenticate the user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to an exemplary embodiment, a personal authentication method includes outputting an auditory stimulus for a registration of a user to an ear of the user, using a sound generator, generating registration data for the user, using a first evoked potential corresponding to a first interval from a first time at which the auditory stimulus is input to the ear of the user to a second time, from an electrode in close contact with the ear of the user, outputting the auditory stimulus for an authentication of the user to the ear of the user, using the sound generator, generating authentication data for the user, using a second evoked potential corresponding to a second interval from a third time at which the auditory stimulus is input to the ear of the user to a fourth time, from the electrode, and comparing the registration data with the authentication data to authenticate the user.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
