    "text": "Tamara Williams has been teaching for as long as she can remember.\n\nAn assistant professor of dance at UNC Charlotte, Williams is the 2019-20\nrecipient of the College of Arts + Architecture faculty Board of Governors\nTeaching Award. The $1,000 annual award is given to a faculty member in a\ngiven college for excellence and innovation in teaching. She found out last\nmonth from College of Arts + Architecture Dean Brook Muller that she had been\nchosen for the award.\n\n\"I was actually fairly surprised and pleasantly surprised, especially during\nthese times where there's a bit of negativity flowing around us-it was really\na picker upper to receive that email from him,\" Williams said.\n\nWilliams teaches African diaspora dance forms, as well as Silvestre Technique,\nan African-Brazilian contemporary dance. She recently completed the first\nmanual for the technique, which will be published by McFarland Press titled\n\"Giving Life to Movement: An ethnographic study, cultural-historical\nexamination, and manual to Silvestre Dance Technique.\" The technique was\ncreated by her mentor, Rosangela Silvestre.\n\n\"I also teach dance in the community in which I share methods for students to\ngo out into community and enter and exit community respectfully, teaching\ndance to diverse populations,\" Williams said.\n\n\"Williams' highly-regarded research, teaching, and community engagement work\ndisseminates ideas and practices related to dance forms of the African\ndiaspora,\" Ann Dils, chair of UNCC's Department of Dance said in Williams'\nnomination letter. \"She has an excellent record of innovative teaching at UNC\nCharlotte. Williams' Dance and the Community course brings students into\ncollaboration with members of community organizations such as the Camino\nCenter and Aldersgate Retirement Center.\"\n\nWhile the spring semester concluded with remote classes, no one knows what\nfall semester classes will look like. Williams confidently said there will be\nfall performances, but they may rely on dance on camera to share them with the\naudience. She also intends to use her research on African American Ring Shout\ntraditions during fall performances.\n\n\"Williams' extensive Ring Shout project-Ring Shout is a 19th and 20th century\ndance form important to African American sacred communities in the Southeast\nUnited States-was especially outstanding, a wonderful example of excellence in\nfaculty and student research and teaching,\" Dils said.\n\nSaid Williams: \"There are a lot of historical sites in Charlotte. We will go\naround to some of those historical sites as places of preservation of historic\nblack dance, and use those to create a dance for our fall dance concert\nseries, and then have it be on camera and share it with the Charlotte\ncommunity and beyond.\"\n\nWilliams, who grew up in Augusta, Georgia, took dance classes daily while also\nteaching there. Teaching while training con-tinued while she attended Florida\nState University as well as during her time as a professional dancer in New\nYork City. While pursuing a master's in dance at Hollins University, she\ndecided to focus on academia to broaden her impact in the community as well as\nher students.\n\n\"I've always taught,\" Williams said, \"even when I was still learning, and I'm\nstill learning. I haven't stopped. Educators are always continuing to learn,\nbut even as an adolescent I was teaching as a shadow of my teacher.\"",

    "html": "<p><person>Tamara Williams</person> has been teaching for as long as she can remember.</p>\n<p>An assistant professor of dance at UNC Charlotte, Williams is the 2019-20 recipient of the <org>College of Arts + Architecture</org> faculty <org>Board of Governors Teaching Award</org>. The <money>$1,000</money> annual award is given to a faculty member in a given college for excellence and innovation in teaching. She found out last month from <org>College of Arts + Architecture Dean Brook Muller</org> that she had been chosen for the award.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was actually fairly surprised and pleasantly surprised, especially during these times where there's a bit of negativity flowing around us-it was really a picker upper to receive that email from him,\" Williams said.</p>\n\n<p>Williams teaches African diaspora dance forms, as well as Silvestre Technique, an African-Brazilian contemporary dance. She recently completed the first manual for the technique, which will be published by <person>McFarland Press</person> titled \"Giving Life to Movement: An ethnographic study, cultural-historical examination, and manual to Silvestre Dance Technique.\" The technique was created by her mentor, <person>Rosangela Silvestre</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"I also teach dance in the community in which I share methods for students to go out into community and enter and exit community respectfully, teaching dance to diverse populations,\" Williams said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Williams' highly-regarded research, teaching, and community engagement work disseminates ideas and practices related to dance forms of the African diaspora,\" <person>Ann Dils</person>, chair of <org>UNCC's Department of Dance</org> said in Williams' nomination letter. \"She has an excellent record of innovative teaching at UNC Charlotte. Williams' Dance and the Community course brings students into collaboration with members of community organizations such as the Camino Center and <location>Aldersgate Retirement Center</location>.\"</p>\n\n<p>While the spring semester concluded with remote classes, no one knows what fall semester classes will look like. Williams confidently said there will be fall performances, but they may rely on dance on camera to share them with the audience. She also intends to use her research on African American Ring Shout traditions during fall performances.</p>\n\n<p>\"Williams' extensive Ring Shout project-Ring Shout is a 19th and 20th century dance form important to <org>African American</org> sacred communities in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Southeast United States</location>-was especially outstanding, a wonderful example of excellence in faculty and student research and teaching,\" Dils said.</p>\n\n<p>Said Williams: \"There are a lot of historical sites in Charlotte. We will go around to some of those historical sites as places of preservation of historic black dance, and use those to create a dance for our fall dance concert series, and then have it be on camera and share it with the Charlotte community and beyond.\"</p>\n\n<p>Williams, who grew up in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.agusta\">Augusta, Georgia</location>, took dance classes daily while also teaching there. Teaching while training con-tinued while she attended <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1221904487\">Florida State University</org> as well as during her time as a professional dancer in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York City</location>. While pursuing a master's in dance at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0871280941\">Hollins University</org>, she decided to focus on academia to broaden her impact in the community as well as her students.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've always taught,\" Williams said, \"even when I was still learning, and I'm still learning. I haven't stopped. Educators are always continuing to learn, but even as an adolescent I was teaching as a shadow of my teacher.\"</p>",
