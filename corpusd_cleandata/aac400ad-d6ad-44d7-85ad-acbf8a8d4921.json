Asgari, who was acquitted of stealing trade secrets in violation\nof US sanctions against Iran last November, arrived in Iran early on 3 June.\nReports of Iranian ship sinking\n\nReports are coming in that an Iranian ship called the Behbahan sank in the\nKhor Abdullah Shipping Channel between Iraq and Kuwait last night.\n\nHardline Tasnim news agency quoted Iraqi politician Kadhim Finjan al Hammami\ntelling local website Shafaaq News that four crew members had been rescued but\nfive others were still missing.
