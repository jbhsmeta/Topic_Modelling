    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Middle East\nDaily \\-- Fresh data on Health and Medicine are presented in a new report.\nAccording to news originating from Abbottabad, Pakistan, by NewsRx\ncorrespondents, research stated, \"The selection criteria for entry into the\nMBBS programme used by Women Medical College (WMC) includes previous academic\nachievements, namely Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary\nCertificate (HSC), and the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT).\nThis study determined the predictive validity of these selection tools and\nexplored the perceptions of stakeholders regarding the selection process and\nthe use of selection tools in WMC.\"\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of\nCommunity Medicine, \"This study utilized both quantitative and qualitative\nmethods. Quantitative methods involved a retrospective cohort study design to\ndetermine the statistical correlation between the performance of candidates in\nthe selection tools and their subsequent academic achievements at medical\ncollege. This consisted of data collected from three cohorts (n=186) of\nstudents who graduated in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Qualitative methods of the\nstudy explored the perceptions of stakeholders through purposive sampling\nusing face-to-face semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using\nthematic analysis. The study showed very weak correlations of SSC with\nperformance in the fourth professional examination undertaken by the students\nand HSC with performance in the first and second professional examinations.\nMDCAT did not correlate with any professional examination. Qualitative\nanalysis identified three emerging themes; a) lack of standardization, b)\nfairness of selection criteria, and c) assessment of noncognitive attributes.\nThe selection tools showed poor predictive ability for the performance of\nstudents in the medical college.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Standardizing the\nselection tools and including an assessment of non-cognitive attributes in the\nselection criteria is suggested.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Predictive Ability And\nStakeholders' Perceptions Of The Selection Tools For Mbbs In Women Medical\nCollege: A Mixed Methods Study. _Journal of Ayub Medical College ,\nAbbottabad_, 2020;32(1):78-82.\n\nThe news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained\nfrom J. Anwar, Dept. of Medical Education & Research, Dept. of Community\nMedicine, Women Medical College, Abbottabad, Pakistan. Additional authors for\nthis research include M.A. Qazi and M. Moffat.\n\n(Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around\nthe world.)",

According to news originating from Abbottabad, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;The selection criteria for entry into the MBBS programme used by <org>Women Medical College</org> (WMC) includes previous academic achievements, namely Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC), and the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT). This study determined the predictive validity of these selection tools and explored the perceptions of stakeholders regarding the selection process and the use of selection tools in WMC.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the <org>Department of Community Medicine</org>, &#8220;This study utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative methods involved a retrospective cohort study design to determine the statistical correlation between the performance of candidates in the selection tools and their subsequent academic achievements at medical college. This consisted of data collected from three cohorts (n=186) of students who graduated in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Qualitative methods of the study explored the perceptions of stakeholders through purposive sampling using face-to-face semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis. The study showed very weak correlations of SSC with performance in the fourth professional examination undertaken by the students and HSC with performance in the first and second professional examinations. MDCAT did not correlate with any professional examination. Qualitative analysis identified three emerging themes; a) lack of standardization, b) fairness of selection criteria, and c) assessment of noncognitive attributes. The selection tools showed poor predictive ability for the performance of students in the medical college.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Standardizing the selection tools and including an assessment of non-cognitive attributes in the selection criteria is suggested.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Predictive Ability And Stakeholders&#8217; Perceptions Of <org>The Selection Tools For Mbbs In Women Medical College</org>: A Mixed Methods Study. <em><org>Journal of Ayub Medical College</org>, Abbottabad</em>, 2020;32(1):78-82.</p>\n<p>The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from <person>J.
