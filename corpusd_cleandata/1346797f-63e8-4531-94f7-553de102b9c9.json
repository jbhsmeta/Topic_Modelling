supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: &#8220;As a technique that is likely to be able to be applied to image recognition to detect whether or not a finger is in contact with a screen where an image is projected from a projector, there is a technique of projecting a NIR-light random speckle pattern, acquiring with a NIR camera NIR light (reflected light) reflected by a finger, and detecting whether or not the finger is in contact with the screen, based on the acquired information (see, for example, PTL 1).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent: &#8220;Technical Problem</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, the image recognition technique described in PTL 1 has a problem in that it has poor detection accuracy for a position (depth) of the finger in the direction of depth as viewed from the NIR camera and hence poor touch recognition accuracy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An object of the invention is to provide an image recognition device, an image recognition method, and an image recognition unit which can achieve touch recognition with high accuracy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Solution to Problem</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such an object is achieved the following invention.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An image recognition device according to the invention is an image
