    "text": "During an April 22 video stream, Pope Francis had strong words for humanity on\nEarth Day, rebuking mankind for its collective failure to take care of the\nplanet.\n\n\"Because of our selfishness we have failed in our responsibility to be\nguardians and stewards of the earth,\" the pontiff said in his address. \"We\nneed only take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is\nfalling into serious disrepair.\"\n\nPope Francis, who has made environmentalism one of the hallmark issues of his\npapacy and heaped praise on teenage climate-change activist Greta Thunberg,\naccused humans of having \"polluted and despoiled\" the Earth.\n\n\"For this reason, various international and local movements have sprung up in\norder to appeal to our consciences,\" he added, perhaps an allusion to groups\nsuch as Thunberg's Fridays for Future, as well as the United Nations (the pope\nspoke at the UN Assembly in 2015 shortly before member states unanimously\nadopted Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, which he called \"a\ngreat step forward for global dialogue, marking a vitally new and universal\nsolidarity\").\n\n\"I deeply appreciate these initiatives; still it will be necessary for our\nchildren to take to the streets to teach us the obvious: we have no future if\nwe destroy the very environment that sustains us,\" the pontiff continued.\n\n\"We have failed to care for the earth, our garden-home; we have failed to care\nfor our brothers and sisters. We have sinned against the earth, against our\nneighbors, and ultimately against the Creator, the benevolent Father who\nprovides for everyone, and desires us to live in communion and flourish\ntogether.\"\n\nAs if treating the Earth as a sentient entity in parity with God himself\nweren't enough, Pope Francis went on to call on his listeners to undergo an\n\"ecological conversion.\" \"We cannot heal the earth unless we love and respect\nit,\" he declared.",

We have sinned against\nthe earth, against our neighbors, and ultimately against the Creator,\nthe benevolent Father who provides for everyone, and desires us to live\nin communion and flourish together.\"</p>\n\n<p>As if treating the Earth as a sentient entity in parity with God\nhimself weren't enough, <person>Pope Francis</person> went on to call on his\nlisteners to undergo an \"ecological conversion.\" \"We\ncannot heal the earth unless we love and respect it,\" he declared.</p>",
