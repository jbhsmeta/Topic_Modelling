    "text": "Australian Prime Minister warns against Black Lives Matter protests for THIS\nreason SCOTT MORRISON has urged Australians to avoid Black Lives Matter\nprotests this weekend. The Australian Prime Minister has been praised\nworldwide for his countries response to coronavirus, seeing an admirably low\nnumber of cases and deaths due to early intervention. But after the death of\nGeorge Floyd in police custody on May 25, protests have been seen worldwide.\nPrime Minister Morrison has revealed that each state's police departments have\nmade their decisions to allow Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter\nprotests. But he pleaded with Australians that \"it's not a good idea to go\".\nMorrison also said that he had asked the Australian Health Protection\nPrincipal Committee to consider the matter of public health and protests. He\nalso said that his message was based on advice from the Chief Medical Officer.\nREAD MORE: Hundreds of mourners remember George Floyd in Minneapolis \\- 'He\ntouched so many hearts' In a press conference in Canberra, Mr Morrison said\nthat a mass gathering shouldn't occur out of respect for the sacrifices made\nby those in lockdown, even though he respects the cause and the right of\npeople to protest. He said: \"We all found a way on Anzac Day to thank those\nwho gave us our liberty and not gather in large numbers. \"And we stood on the\nend of our driveways and we held up a light on that dawn in our windows or our\nbalconies and we found a way to celebrate those who gave us our liberty.\n\"Let's not misuse that liberty. \"Let's respect it. \"Let's respect other\nAustralians.\n\n\"And let's thank those who had the absolute agony of not being able to say\ngoodbye to a loved one, by showing responsibility this weekend.\" Regional\nleaders in Australia have also voiced their objections to the protests.\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews has told protesters in his state to stay at\nhome to protect public health. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: \"You\ncan't go to the footy. \"Why on earth should 10,000 people be allowed to make\nmerry at the Town Hall steps?\" But Queensland leader Annastacia Palaszczuk has\nremained silent on the matter, and New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian\nis under fire after giving protesters the green light to demonstrate despite\nconcerns of a second wave of coronavirus.

What happened to her?\n\n(EXPLAINER) Black Lives Matter protest: How to prepare for a protest - a guide\n(NEWS) On Friday morning, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said\nthe country's successful battle against the virus could be undone by\nprotesters. He said: \"There is a risk that all of the gains that we have made\nare put at risk by people gathering in large numbers.\" Ms Berejiklian added:\n\"We're probably doing better than we anticipated at this stage of the\npandemic, however, we have to be cautious, we have to be vigilant, we have to\nbe safe to make sure that even the mildest symptom means we get tested.\" Under\nrestrictions put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, up to 20 people can\nattend weddings and up to 50 can go to funerals, places of worship,\nrestaurants, pubs and cafes. Householders are allowed up to five visitors and\noutdoor gatherings are restricted to 10 people. Mr Morrison previously has\nwarned against \"importing the things that are happening overseas to\nAustralia\", acknowledging during a radio interview on Thursday that Australia\nalso had problems \"in this space\" that it needed to address.\n\nBut he said: \"We don't need the divisions that we're seeing in other countries\n- we need to stick together and look after each other.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that COVID-19 disproportionately affects aboriginal\npeople, and that they are at the most risk from the protests should they be\nallowed to go ahead. Protesters in Sydney on Thursday chanted \"I can't\nbreathe\" and \"Justice today, for David Dungay\" - the 26-year-old Aboriginal\nman who said \"I can't breathe\" 12 times before he died in 2015 while being\nrestrained by five prison guards.\n\nDungay is one of at least 432 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the royal\ncommission in 1991.",

    "html": "<p>Australian Prime Minister warns against <org>Black Lives Matter</org> protests for THIS reason <person>SCOTT MORRISON</person> has urged Australians to avoid <org>Black Lives Matter</org> protests this weekend.  The Australian Prime Minister has been praised worldwide for his countries response to coronavirus, seeing an admirably low number of cases and deaths due to early intervention. But after the death of <person>George Floyd</person> in police custody on <chron>May 25</chron>, protests have been seen worldwide.   Prime Minister Morrison has revealed that each state&#8217;s police departments have made their decisions to allow <org>Black Lives Matter</org> and Indigenous Lives Matter protests.    But he pleaded with Australians that &#8220;it&#8217;s not a good idea to go&#8221;.      Morrison also said that he had asked the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to consider the matter of public health and protests.      He also said that his message was based on advice from the Chief Medical Officer.   READ MORE: Hundreds of mourners remember <person>George Floyd</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> - &#8216;He touched so many hearts&#8217;    In a press conference in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..canber\">Canberra</location>, <person>Mr Morrison</person> said that a mass gathering shouldn&#8217;t occur out of respect for the sacrifices made by those in lockdown, even though he respects the cause and the right of people to protest.      He said: &#8220;We all found a way on Anzac Day to thank those who gave us our liberty and not gather in large numbers.      &#8220;And we stood on the end of our driveways and we held up a light on that dawn in our windows or our balconies and we found a way to celebrate those who gave us our liberty.      &#8220;Let's not misuse that liberty.      &#8220;Let's respect it.      &#8220;Let's respect other Australians.</p>\n\n<p>     &#8220;And let's thank those who had the absolute agony of not being able to say goodbye to a loved one, by showing responsibility this weekend.&#8221;   Regional leaders in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> have also voiced their objections to the protests.      Victorian Premier <person>Daniel Andrews</person> has told protesters in his state to stay at home to protect public health.      Former Prime Minister <person>Tony Abbott</person> said: &#8220;You can't go to the footy.      &#8220;Why on earth should 10,000 people be allowed to make merry at the <location>Town Hall</location> steps?&#8221;      But Queensland leader <person>Annastacia Palaszczuk</person> has remained silent on the matter, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..nwswls\">New South Wales</location> Premier <person>Gladys Berejiklian</person> is under fire after giving protesters the green light to demonstrate despite concerns of a second wave of coronavirus.

He said: &#8220;There is a risk that all of the gains that we have made are put at risk by people gathering in large numbers.&#8221;      <person>Ms Berejiklian</person> added: &#8220;We&#8217;re probably doing better than we anticipated at this stage of the pandemic, however, we have to be cautious, we have to be vigilant, we have to be safe to make sure that even the mildest symptom means we get tested.&#8221;      Under restrictions put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, up to 20 people can attend weddings and up to 50 can go to funerals, places of worship, restaurants, pubs and cafes.      Householders are allowed up to five visitors and outdoor gatherings are restricted to 10 people.   <person>Mr Morrison</person> previously has warned against &#8220;importing the things that are happening overseas to Australia&#8221;, acknowledging during a radio interview on Thursday that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> also had problems &#8220;in this space&#8221; that it needed to address.</p>\n\n<p>    But he said: &#8220;We don&#8217;t need the divisions that we&#8217;re seeing in other countries &#8211; we need to stick together and look after each other.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>     He also pointed out that COVID-19 disproportionately affects aboriginal people, and that they are at the most risk from the protests should they be allowed to go ahead.      Protesters in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..sydney\">Sydney</location> on Thursday chanted &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; and &#8220;Justice today, for David Dungay&#8221; &#8211; the 26-year-old Aboriginal man who said &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; 12 times before he died in 2015 while being restrained by five prison guards.</p>\n\n<p>    Dungay is one of at least 432 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the royal commission in 1991.</p>",
