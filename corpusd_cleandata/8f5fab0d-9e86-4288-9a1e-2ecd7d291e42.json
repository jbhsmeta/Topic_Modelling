    "text": "Indiana's move to expand COVID-19 testing is part of the overall plan to\nreopen the state.\n\nBut it's not reaching its potential to test 30,000 Hoosiers daily. Right now,\nthe state is seeing about 5,000 new tests a day.\n\nThe contract with OptumServe, a division of the United Health Group, began\ntesting in 20 sites May 6. One of the first sites was the Danville Armory. The\ntesting is by appointment and easy to arrange. Expanded testing also requires\nless requirements. Now, you may be tested if you have any risk factors\nincluding underlying conditions, contact with a person who has tested positive\nor just your age will qualify.\n\nI decided to get tested May 11 to experience the process and to satisfy my\ncuriosity. The process was easy. Officials are encouraging more people to get\ntested at one of these sites.\n\nIt is important to note that these tests are to see if you are actively\ninfected with COVID-19.\n\nThis does not determine if you recovered from the coronavirus. That is an\nantibody test.\n\nTesting begins with registration at lhi.care/covidtesting, a logistics company\nwith a database for setting an appointment. The process begins by choosing the\nstate (Indiana) and then answering a few qualifying questions. Testing is\navailable to a much broader range of population.\n\nIf you're older than 65, work at a long-term care facility, or are obese, have\nhigh blood pressure, diabetes. Even identifying as a member of a high-risk\nminority population will get you into a testing site.\n\nAs far as I know, there is no check on any of the qualifying criteria. Pick\none and then you will begin scheduling your test. First, you pick a site near\nyour ZIP code and then you pick a time convenient for you. The appointments\nare in half-hour increments and are available from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at many\nsites. Hours do vary.\n\nThe site will also ask if you have medical insurance.\n\nIt asks for the information about the insurance so have your medical insurance\nID card handy. It doesn't matter if you have insurance.\n\nThe information is being collected to submit for reimbursement from the\nfederal government through the CARES Act.\n\nThere is a registration number that you will need to present at the site. So,\nprint it or take a snapshot with your phone. The company will email you.\n\nOn the day of your appointment, you need to arrive a few minutes early. At the\nDanville Armory, the door was locked, but someone opened the door to let me\nin. Outside was an Indiana State Police officer in his cruiser. The\nidentifying signs were battered and torn and were difficult to read, but once\nI was close enough, I could see I was in the right place.\n\nInside looked like the set of some infectious disease horror movie. Walls were\ncovered with plastic, windows covered in double plastic. One of the doors was\ncovered in plastic and had two fans pulling air out of the room, one stacked\non top of the other.\n\nOnce you are registered the personnel print out a sticker to attach to the\ntest. You are given the test kit and asked to go to the nurse at the next\nstation.\n\nMuch has been made of the length of the testing swabs. There were several\nstories and posts on the Internet telling or showing the depth the swab had to\nbe inserted into your nostril. However, that was not the case with this test.\nThe swabs are not much longer than a Q-tip. I was wearing a mask and the nurse\nasked me to pull the mask down under my nose and lean my head back as if I was\nlooking at the ceiling. She inserted the swab and twirled it around. It\ntickled slightly. She did it for the other nostril and then said I was\nfinished. As I left through the back door of the armory, there was a poster\ntelling me to expect results in 48-72 hours.\n\nBecause I wasn't experiencing any symptoms, and I take precautions, I did not\nexpect to hear I had the disease. However, scientists with the Fairbanks\nSchool of Public Health did a study and determined that 45% of the infected do\nnot show any symptoms. The term asymptomatic is thrown around a lot by health\nprofessionals, but it means nearly half of all carriers don't feel sick or\neven know they have it.\n\nSome 60 hours later, I received an email telling me my results were in. I had\nto log back into the LHI website to find the letter I could print saying I was\nnegative. I did not have the virus three days before, at the moment I was\ntested. It is important to realize and something Indiana State Department of\nHealth Commissioner Kristina Box has been saying consistently, a test patient\ncould pick up the virus the next day. The purpose of the testing is to\nidentify those infected that either may be asymptomatic or haven't developed\nsymptoms yet.\n\nHealth officials say you don't have to have a fever or cough to spread the\nnovel coronavirus.\n\nThe director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr.\nAnthony Fauci has said a vaccine could be developed by the end of the year. As\nthe economy opens back up, testing and contact tracing will be a key to\nfighting the rapid spread of the disease.\n\nThe testing is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nMonday through Friday at the Danville National Guard Armory, 1245 E. Main St.\nin Danville.\n\nIt is also available at Hendricks Regional Health and the parking lot of\nWalmart in Camby.\n\nHRH and the Walmart lot are not state testing sites. The hours and\nrequirements are different and there may be a charge involved.\n\nYou can begin to find a testing site at\n[www.coronavirus.in.gov](http://www.coronavirus.in.gov). There is a banner in\nred at the top of the page where you can choose a testing site by county.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.in\">Indiana's</location> move to expand COVID-19 testing is part of the overall plan to reopen the state.</p>\n<p>But it's not reaching its potential to test 30,000 Hoosiers daily. Right now, the state is seeing about 5,000 new tests a day.</p>\n\n<p>The contract with OptumServe, a division of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1435786410\">United Health Group</org>, began testing in 20 sites <chron>May 6</chron>. One of the first sites was the <location>Danville Armory</location>. The testing is by appointment and easy to arrange. Expanded testing also requires less requirements. Now, you may be tested if you have any risk factors including underlying conditions, contact with a person who has tested positive or just your age will qualify.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to get tested <chron>May 11</chron> to experience the process and to satisfy my curiosity. The process was easy. Officials are encouraging more people to get tested at one of these sites.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that these tests are to see if you are actively infected with COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>This does not determine if you recovered from the coronavirus. That is an antibody test.</p>\n\n<p>Testing begins with registration at lhi.care/covidtesting, a logistics company with a database for setting an appointment. The process begins by choosing the state (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.in\">Indiana</location>) and then answering a few qualifying questions. Testing is available to a much broader range of population.</p>\n\n<p>If you're older than 65, work at a long-term care facility, or are obese, have high blood pressure, diabetes. Even identifying as a member of a high-risk minority population will get you into a testing site.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, there is no check on any of the qualifying criteria. Pick one and then you will begin scheduling your test. First, you pick a site near your ZIP code and then you pick a time convenient for you. The appointments are in half-hour increments and are available from <chron>8 a.m. to 6 p.m.</chron> at many sites. Hours do vary.</p>\n\n<p>The site will also ask if you have medical insurance.</p>\n\n<p>It asks for the information about the insurance so have your medical insurance ID card handy. It doesn't matter if you have insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The information is being collected to submit for reimbursement from the federal government through the CARES Act.</p>\n\n<p>There is a registration number that you will need to present at the site. So, print it or take a snapshot with your phone. The company will email you.</p>\n\n<p>On the day of your appointment, you need to arrive a few minutes early. At the <location>Danville Armory</location>, the door was locked, but someone opened the door to let me in. Outside was an <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2386362890\">Indiana State Police</org> officer in his cruiser. The identifying signs were battered and torn and were difficult to read, but once I was close enough, I could see I was in the right place.</p>\n\n<p>Inside looked like the set of some infectious disease horror movie. Walls were covered with plastic, windows covered in double plastic. One of the doors was covered in plastic and had two fans pulling air out of the room, one stacked on top of the other.</p>\n\n<p>Once you are registered the personnel print out a sticker to attach to the test. You are given the test kit and asked to go to the nurse at the next station.</p>\n\n<p>Much has been made of the length of the testing swabs. There were several stories and posts on the Internet telling or showing the depth the swab had to be inserted into your nostril. However, that was not the case with this test. The swabs are not much longer than a Q-tip. I was wearing a mask and the nurse asked me to pull the mask down under my nose and lean my head back as if I was looking at the ceiling. She inserted the swab and twirled it around. It tickled slightly. She did it for the other nostril and then said I was finished. As I left through the back door of the armory, there was a poster telling me to expect results in 48-72 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Because I wasn't experiencing any symptoms, and I take precautions, I did not expect to hear I had the disease. However, scientists with the <org>Fairbanks School of Public Health</org> did a study and determined that 45% of the infected do not show any symptoms. The term asymptomatic is thrown around a lot by health professionals, but it means nearly half of all carriers don't feel sick or even know they have it.</p>\n\n<p>Some 60 hours later, I received an email telling me my results were in. I had to log back into the LHI website to find the letter I could print saying I was negative. I did not have the virus three days before, at the moment I was tested. It is important to realize and something <org>Indiana State Department of Health Commissioner Kristina Box</org> has been saying consistently, a test patient could pick up the virus the next day. The purpose of the testing is to identify those infected that either may be asymptomatic or haven't developed symptoms yet.</p>\n\n<p>Health officials say you don't have to have a fever or cough to spread the novel coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>The director of the <org>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease</org>, Dr. <person>Anthony Fauci</person> has said a vaccine could be developed by the end of the year. As the economy opens back up, testing and contact tracing will be a key to fighting the rapid spread of the disease.</p>\n\n<p>The testing is available from <chron>8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>Monday through Friday at the <location>Danville National Guard Armory</location>, <location>1245 E. Main St.</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.danlle\">Danville</location>.</p>\n\n<p>It is also available at <org>Hendricks Regional Health</org> and the parking lot of Walmart in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.camby\">Camby</location>.</p>\n\n<p>HRH and the Walmart lot are not state testing sites. The hours and requirements are different and there may be a charge involved.</p>\n\n<p>You can begin to find a testing site at <a href=\"http://www.coronavirus.in.gov\">www.coronavirus.in.gov</a>. There is a banner in red at the top of the page where you can choose a testing site by county.</p>",
