    "text": "If you're a leader, you're a lifeline.\n\nLike it or not, you're one of the most important people in the daily life of\nyour team.\n\nWhen people are working remotely, the words of the leader have outsized\nimpact. In a time of uncertainty, your ability to give high quality meaningful\nfeedback is crucial because:\n\nPeople no longer get anecdotal feedback from colleagues. The conversations\naround the water cooler that buoyed people's spirits (and sometimes helped\nthem avoid mistakes) have disappeared.\n\nThe daily news is negative, and many home environments can be chaotic with\nmultiple additional responsibilities. People need to feel grounded and\nconfident at work. The relationship with the leader can be a lifeline to\nnormalcy.\n\nThe virtual experience erodes connection. Without body language and a physical\npresence, words have even more power. Employees are more likely to internalize\nthe most literal version of your words without the benefit of the emotional\nclues that reveal intent and spurn collaboration.\n\nHere are specific things you can do to make both positive and negative\nfeedback more actionable and empowering.\n\nPositive feedback\n\n1\\. Don't wait for review time, or even the end of the week.\n\nThe first priority in giving positive feedback is to, obviously, do it. It's\neasy for good work to get glossed over in the cadence of daily business.\nCalling it out increases the engagement and future performance of your team.\n\n2\\. Make it more specific.\n\nEveryone loves hearing \"Great job!\" but in a virtual world you don't have the\nsmiles and handshakes to amplify it. If you want positive behavior to be\nrepeated, be more specific when you call it out. Take it from \"Great job on\nthat report\" to \"I was so impressed with the level of detail in your report,\nit really shows how deep your product knowledge is.\" This tells people exactly\nwhat you appreciate about them and gives them a template for repeating it.\n\n3\\. Connect the dots to impact.\n\nPraise means even more when you know your actions had a positive impact on\nyour team, the organization and, ultimately, your customers. Let's go back to\nthat high level of detail in the report. Amp it up one step more by shining a\nlight on the impact of the good work. Saying things like, \"It enabled me to\nclearly see the markets where our team can make a bigger impact\" or \"That gave\neveryone a level of confidence in moving forward with X decision\" tells the\nteam members that they matter.\n\nNegative feedback\n\n1\\. Give it early.\n\nYou don't have nonverbals to demonstrate displeasure, so you have to speak up\nearlier. Not early, like I noticed you made this one mistake one time early,\nbut shortly after you start to notice a pattern of behavior. You don't want to\nmake your team member feel awful, nor do you want to beat around the bush. The\nmore you drag it out, the worse the teammate will feel when you finally do\naddress it, and the bigger cost to their pride and the team's productivity.\n\n2\\. Focus on facts without assuming intent.\n\nYou can say, \"I noticed that you missed several errors in the last few rounds\nof product testing\" versus \"you obviously don't care about the details.\" This\nkeeps it from getting personal. You're not trying to shame the person; you're\ntrying to help them improve.\n\n3\\. Remind the employee of when they did well.\n\nThis might look like \"Remember when you made that project plan, and we all\ncommented on how clearly you outlined the deliverables? That's the type of\nclarity we need on this project.\" That shows the person, it's in your power to\ndo this, you're capable.\n\nIn a virtual workspace, feedback matters more than ever. And in times of\nuncertainty, it's a lifeline for your team.\n\nPositive feedback helps your team feel more meaning and pride in their work.\nAnd it tells them which behaviors are high-impact and should be repeated.\nNegative feedback (done well) can actually serve the same purpose. It does not\nhave to be soul-sucking to you or your team.\n\nIt's an opportunity to build resilience, improve as a group and up-level each\nother.\n\nYour words as leader matter to your team. In this environment, they matter\neven more.\n\n\u0096 Lisa Earle McLeod is a leadership consultant and the author of several\nbooks.

    "html": "<p>If you're a leader, you're a lifeline.</p>\n<p>Like it or not, you're one of the most important people in the daily life of your team.</p>\n\n<p>When people are working remotely, the words of the leader have outsized impact. In a time of uncertainty, your ability to give high quality meaningful feedback is crucial because:</p>\n\n<p>People no longer get anecdotal feedback from colleagues. The conversations around the water cooler that buoyed people's spirits (and sometimes helped them avoid mistakes) have disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>The daily news is negative, and many home environments can be chaotic with multiple additional responsibilities. People need to feel grounded and confident at work. The relationship with the leader can be a lifeline to normalcy.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual experience erodes connection. Without body language and a physical presence, words have even more power. Employees are more likely to internalize the most literal version of your words without the benefit of the emotional clues that reveal intent and spurn collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>Here are specific things you can do to make both positive and negative feedback more actionable and empowering.</p>\n\n<p>Positive feedback</p>\n\n<p>1. Don't wait for review time, or even the end of the week.</p>\n\n<p>The first priority in giving positive feedback is to, obviously, do it. It's easy for good work to get glossed over in the cadence of daily business. Calling it out increases the engagement and future performance of your team.</p>\n\n<p>2. Make it more specific.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone loves hearing \"Great job!\" but in a virtual world you don't have the smiles and handshakes to amplify it. If you want positive behavior to be repeated, be more specific when you call it out. Take it from \"Great job on that report\" to \"I was so impressed with the level of detail in your report, it really shows how deep your product knowledge is.\" This tells people exactly what you appreciate about them and gives them a template for repeating it.</p>\n\n<p>3. Connect the dots to impact.</p>\n\n<p>Praise means even more when you know your actions had a positive impact on your team, the organization and, ultimately, your customers. Let's go back to that high level of detail in the report. Amp it up one step more by shining a light on the impact of the good work. Saying things like, \"It enabled me to clearly see the markets where our team can make a bigger impact\" or \"That gave everyone a level of confidence in moving forward with X decision\" tells the team members that they matter.</p>\n\n<p>Negative feedback</p>\n\n<p>1. Give it early.</p>\n\n<p>You don't have nonverbals to demonstrate displeasure, so you have to speak up earlier. Not early, like I noticed you made this one mistake one time early, but shortly after you start to notice a pattern of behavior. You don't want to make your team member feel awful, nor do you want to beat around the bush. The more you drag it out, the worse the teammate will feel when you finally do address it, and the bigger cost to their pride and the team's productivity.</p>\n\n<p>2. Focus on facts without assuming intent.</p>\n\n<p>You can say, \"I noticed that you missed several errors in the last few rounds of product testing\" versus \"you obviously don't care about the details.\" This keeps it from getting personal. You're not trying to shame the person; you're trying to help them improve.</p>\n\n<p>3. Remind the employee of when they did well.</p>\n\n<p>This might look like \"Remember when you made that project plan, and we all commented on how clearly you outlined the deliverables? That's the type of clarity we need on this project.\" That shows the person, it's in your power to do this, you're capable.</p>\n\n<p>In a virtual workspace, feedback matters more than ever. And in times of uncertainty, it's a lifeline for your team.</p>\n\n<p>Positive feedback helps your team feel more meaning and pride in their work. And it tells them which behaviors are high-impact and should be repeated. Negative feedback (done well) can actually serve the same purpose. It does not have to be soul-sucking to you or your team.</p>\n\n<p>It's an opportunity to build resilience, improve as a group and up-level each other.</p>\n\n<p>Your words as leader matter to your team. In this environment, they matter even more.</p>\n\n<p>&#150; <person>Lisa Earle McLeod</person> is a leadership consultant and the author of several books.
