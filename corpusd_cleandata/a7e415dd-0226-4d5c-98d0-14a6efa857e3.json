    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life\nScience Daily \\-- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract,\nour journalists obtained the following quote sourced from\n[biorxiv.org](http://biorxiv.org):\n\n\"Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant\ndevelopment and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies\nhave identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade,\nincluding PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein\nkinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative\nregulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut\noff \"leaky\" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of\nmonomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors.\n\n\"However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP\nGTPases remain elusive.\n\n\"In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05\nmilliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard\nprotein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex\nstructure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1.\n\n\"In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and\nidentified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex\nstability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using\nlarge-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex\nstructures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation\nof ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.\"\n\nThis preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.

    "title": "Structural Basis for Negative Regulation of ABA Signaling by ROP11 GTPase: Plant Biology",
    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>NewsRx Life Science Daily</org> -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org\">biorxiv.org</a>:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off &#8220;leaky&#8221; ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.
