    "text": "SPRINGFIELD \\- A peaceful protest organized largely by teenagers drew several\nhundred people to the Illinois Statehouse on Monday to demonstrate against the\nrecent death of George Floyd in Minnesota and countless other African\nAmericans who have died at the hands of law enforcement throughout the U.S. in\nrecent years.\n\nMonday's protest came the day after an estimated 3,000 vehicles took part in a\nparade through the state capital's downtown area while more violent protests\ngripped Chicago and other major cities throughout the U.S.\n\nProtests were also reported in Champaign, Aurora and Rockford, according to\nthe Illinois State Police.\n\nFloyd died Monday, May 25, after a white Minneapolis Police officer pinned him\nto the ground and held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes while\nthree other officers took no action to stop it. All four of the officers have\nsince been fired and the officer who knelt on his neck was charged with third-\ndegree murder.\n\nFloyd reportedly was suspected of trying to spend a fake $20 bill.\n\n\"They just take it like another black man killed by the police. We don't take\nit like that,\" Nykeyla Henderson, 17, one of the organizers of the protest,\nsaid during an interview.\n\nWith chants of \"black lives matter,\" \"I can't breathe,\" and \"hands up, don't\nshoot,\" the throng marched from the Statehouse toward the city's downtown area\nuntil they were blocked by barricades to prevent them from getting near the\ncity's municipal building. From there, they turned south, marching just past\nthe Abraham Lincoln home and then back to the Capitol.\n\nSeveral people who attended the demonstration talked about what went through\ntheir minds when they first saw the images of Floyd's death, as well as their\nown experiences with law enforcement.\n\nHenderson said she had personally had several negative encounters with\nSpringfield police over the years.\n\n\"I've seen them manhandle my dad,\" she said. \"I've seen my dad get arrested,\nI've seen my mom get arrested before right in front of me. I've seen my dad\nbeing snatched out of my hands by the police before. I've seen them constantly\ncome by my house.  I've had problems with the police before. I was standing on\nthe side of the road talking to my mama one day and they stopped me.\"\n\n\"George Floyd's death, it brought anger to me and it brought anger to the two\nother people that helped me organize this,\" said Ariona Fairlee, 15, one of\nthe organizers. \"And you can't just sit around anymore. Like, we're young but\nthe young is what needs to change things because nobody else is going to do\nit.\"\n\n\"Horrified but not surprised,\" said Maya Harris, of Springfield. \"Personally,\nin my opinion, I always feel uneasy around the police. I always have that\nsense of fear, that sense of guilt, that sense of uncertainty. And that just\ngoes with growing up black in America, and growing up black period, anywhere.\nYou have that sense of uncertainty with the law. You don't know if you feel\nprotected or not.\"\n\nThe demonstrations Sunday night and Monday afternoon in Springfield were\nlargely peaceful, although some buildings in the downtown area had been marred\nby graffiti, including a local performing arts center where someone had spray-\npainted the words \"stop killing us\" on an exterior wall.\n\nStill, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he had issued disaster proclamations\nfor Sangamon County and eight other counties in the state at the request of\nlocal authorities so that Illinois State Police could be deployed to aid local\nlaw enforcement in maintaining control.\n\nISP Director Brendan Kelly said in a separate news conference that 300\ntroopers from various divisions had been temporarily reassigned to assist in\npatrol operations as needed through regional support centers in northern,\ncentral and southern Illinois.\n\nKelly said that there have been reports of looting, criminal damage to\nproperty, arson and other crimes in various cities throughout the state.\n\n\"This is not just a Chicago-focused concern by any stretch of the\nimagination,\" he said. \"We've had requests for assistance from every part of\nthe state.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Henderson said she hopes the demonstrations in Springfield remain\npeaceful, although she said she understands the anger that has led to more\nviolent actions elsewhere.\n\n\"I applaud everyone who's doing it for the right reason,\" she said. \"If you're\ndoing it for the right reason, I applaud you. But we're going to keep this\npeaceful until something is done against us. If nothing is done against us,\nwe're going to keep it peaceful.\"",

    "title": "More than 1,000 gather for peaceful protest at Illinois Statehouse",
    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.sprgfd\">SPRINGFIELD</location> - A peaceful protest organized largely by teenagers drew several hundred people to the Illinois Statehouse on Monday to demonstrate against the recent death of <person>George Floyd</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location> and countless other African Americans who have died at the hands of law enforcement throughout the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> in recent years.</p>\n<p>Monday's protest came the day after an estimated 3,000 vehicles took part in a parade through the state capital's downtown area while more violent protests gripped <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location> and other major cities throughout the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></p>\n\n<p>Protests were also reported in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chaign\">Champaign</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.aurora\">Aurora</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.rockfd\">Rockford</location>, according to the <org>Illinois State Police</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd died <chron>Monday, May 25</chron>, after a white <org>Minneapolis Police</org> officer pinned him to the ground and held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes while three other officers took no action to stop it. All four of the officers have since been fired and the officer who knelt on his neck was charged with third-degree murder.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd reportedly was suspected of trying to spend a fake <money>$20</money> bill.</p>\n\n<p>\"They just take it like another black man killed by the police. We don't take it like that,\" Nykeyla Henderson, 17, one of the organizers of the protest, said during an interview.</p>\n\n<p>With chants of \"black lives matter,\" \"I can't breathe,\" and \"hands up, don't shoot,\" the throng marched from the <org>Statehouse</org> toward the city's downtown area until they were blocked by barricades to prevent them from getting near the city's municipal building. From there, they turned south, marching just past the Abraham Lincoln home and then back to the <org>Capitol</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Several people who attended the demonstration talked about what went through their minds when they first saw the images of Floyd's death, as well as their own experiences with law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.henson\">Henderson</location> said she had personally had several negative encounters with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.sprgfd\">Springfield</location> police over the years.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've seen them manhandle my dad,\" she said. \"I've seen my dad get arrested, I've seen my mom get arrested before right in front of me. I've seen my dad being snatched out of my hands by the police before. I've seen them constantly come by my house. &#133; I've had problems with the police before. I was standing on the side of the road talking to my mama one day and they stopped me.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"<person>George Floyd's</person> death, it brought anger to me and it brought anger to the two other people that helped me organize this,\" said Ariona Fairlee, 15, one of the organizers. \"And you can't just sit around anymore. Like, we're young but the young is what needs to change things because nobody else is going to do it.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Horrified but not surprised,\" said <person>Maya Harris</person>, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.sprgfd\">Springfield</location>. \"Personally, in my opinion, I always feel uneasy around the police. I always have that sense of fear, that sense of guilt, that sense of uncertainty. And that just goes with growing up black in America, and growing up black period, anywhere. You have that sense of uncertainty with the law. You don't know if you feel protected or not.\"</p>\n\n<p>The demonstrations Sunday night and Monday afternoon in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.sprgfd\">Springfield</location> were largely peaceful, although some buildings in the downtown area had been marred by graffiti, including a local performing arts center where someone had spray-painted the words \"stop killing us\" on an exterior wall.</p>\n\n<p>Still, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday that he had issued disaster proclamations for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.sanmon\">Sangamon County</location> and eight other counties in the state at the request of local authorities so that <org>Illinois State Police</org> could be deployed to aid local law enforcement in maintaining control.</p>\n\n<p>ISP Director <person>Brendan Kelly</person> said in a separate news conference that 300 troopers from various divisions had been temporarily reassigned to assist in patrol operations as needed through regional support centers in northern, central and southern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.il\">Illinois</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly said that there have been reports of looting, criminal damage to property, arson and other crimes in various cities throughout the state.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is not just a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>-focused concern by any stretch of the imagination,\" he said. \"We've had requests for assistance from every part of the state.\"</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.henson\">Henderson</location> said she hopes the demonstrations in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.sprgfd\">Springfield</location> remain peaceful, although she said she understands the anger that has led to more violent actions elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>\"I applaud everyone who's doing it for the right reason,\" she said. \"If you're doing it for the right reason, I applaud you. But we're going to keep this peaceful until something is done against us. If nothing is done against us, we're going to keep it peaceful.\"</p>",
