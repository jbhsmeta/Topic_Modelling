    "text": "One town in Stanly will celebrate Memorial Day by celebrating V-E Day with a\nsister city in France as both celebrate a World War II anniversary.\n\nV-E Day celebrates the Allies acceptance of Nazi Germany's surrender of its\nforces on May 8, 1945 at Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's headquarters in Reims,\nFrance.\n\nPlans this year to celebrate the 75th anniversary of V-E Day had been made by\nNorwood for Memorial Day, which would coincide with the inauguration of a\nSister City relationship between Jouarre, France and Norwood. The unveiling of\nroadside signs along with a visiting delegation from Jouarre had been planned\nas a part of the normal Memorial Day festivities.\n\nThe genesis of the idea began six years ago when Claude Pottin, the commander\nof La Fraternelle, a French veterans' organization, learned of a plane crash\njust outside Jouarre in a forest.\n\nHe suggested to the town's mayor at the time the construction of a World War\nII memorial and information plaque to honor the pilot's sacrifice.\n\nPottin later met Graham Wright, an Englishman and amateur World War II\nhistorian, while Wright was in Jouarre. Wright became interested in the\nproject and had a friend research the crash. Upon learning the pilot was from\nNorwood, Wright called the local VFW post, who got him in contact with Les\nYoung, a local historian.\n\nOperation Mustang was organized by La Fraternelle and the town of Jouarre,\nwhich has an approximate population of 4,000 citizens.\n\nA group of Stanly citizens, including Chester Lowder, a former Stanly County\ncommissioner and distant relative of Lt. James Paul Lowder Jr., were present\nin 2015 when the memorial in France was officially dedicated by the Jouarre\nmayor.\n\nAfter some delays for several years, Young and members of the Sister City\nCommittee revisited the idea of becoming a sister city with Jouarre. The\ncommittee was going to officially dedicate the new signage and host a Jouarre\ncontingent for celebrations as a part of Norwood's annual Memorial Day\ncelebrations hosted by the VFW.\n\nInstead, the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions related to the\nsituation forced organizers to change plans into a virtual celebration.\n\nYoung said the local committee decided to use YouTube video programming to put\ntogether a virtual announcement of the Sister City relationship. A video is\nexpected to be posted at or before 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nSponsorship of the video and celebration is shared jointly with the Town of\nNorwood and the town's Veterans of Foreign Wars post, the James P. Lowder Post\nNo. 6183.\n\nMonday will see the people of Jouarre honor the person for whom Norwood's VFW\nPost is named, Lt. James Paul Lowder Jr., who died July 8, 1944, while flying\na P-51 Mustang fighter plane during World War II. The plane crashed in a\nforest close to Jouarre.\n\nTo honor Lowder's sacrifice in helping to free France, the citizens of Jouarre\nhonored the Norwood native with a memorial stone in the town's cemetery.\nLowder is not buried in Jouarre, but at the Epinal American Cemetery in\nDinoze.\n\n\"It is our cherished hope that our Sister City affiliation with Jouarre will\nnurture and bloom over time into genuine collaboration with cultural and\npersonal exchanges, virtual and in person, with mutual benefits to citizens,\nand especially the youth, of our two communities,\" Young said. \"We are aware\nthat such collaboration must be founded on citizen initiatives and\ninvolvement.\"\n\nThe Norwood Sister City poster and flyer were designed by Robert Patterson, a\nretired principal with Stanly County Schools.\n\nThe post Norwood celebrates Memorial Day with virtual videos, announces new\nsister city appeared first on The Stanly News & Press.",

    "html": "<p>One town in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.stanly\">Stanly</location> will celebrate <chron>Memorial Day</chron> by celebrating V-E Day with a sister city in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location> as both celebrate a World War II anniversary.</p>\n<p>V-E Day celebrates the Allies acceptance of Nazi <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany's</location> surrender of its forces on <chron>May 8, 1945</chron> at Gen. <person>Dwight Eisenhower's</person> headquarters in Reims, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Plans this year to celebrate the 75th anniversary of V-E Day had been made by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood</location> for <chron>Memorial Day</chron>, which would coincide with the inauguration of a Sister City relationship between Jouarre, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood</location>. The unveiling of roadside signs along with a visiting delegation from Jouarre had been planned as a part of the normal <chron>Memorial Day</chron> festivities.</p>\n\n<p>The genesis of the idea began six years ago when <person>Claude Pottin</person>, the commander of La Fraternelle, a French veterans' organization, learned of a plane crash just outside Jouarre in a forest.</p>\n\n<p>He suggested to the town's mayor at the time the construction of a <org>World War II memorial</org> and information plaque to honor the pilot's sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>Pottin later met <person>Graham Wright</person>, an Englishman and amateur World War II historian, while Wright was in Jouarre. Wright became interested in the project and had a friend research the crash. Upon learning the pilot was from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood</location>, Wright called the local VFW post, who got him in contact with <person>Les Young</person>, a local historian.</p>\n\n<p>Operation Mustang was organized by La Fraternelle and the town of Jouarre, which has an approximate population of 4,000 citizens.</p>\n\n<p>A group of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.stanly\">Stanly</location> citizens, including <person>Chester Lowder</person>, a former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.stanly\">Stanly County</location> commissioner and distant relative of Lt. <person>James Paul Lowder Jr</person>., were present in 2015 when the memorial in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location> was officially dedicated by the Jouarre mayor.</p>\n\n<p>After some delays for several years, Young and members of the Sister City Committee revisited the idea of becoming a sister city with Jouarre. The committee was going to officially dedicate the new signage and host a Jouarre contingent for celebrations as a part of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood's</location> annual <chron>Memorial Day</chron> celebrations hosted by the VFW.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions related to the situation forced organizers to change plans into a virtual celebration.</p>\n\n<p>Young said the local committee decided to use YouTube video programming to put together a virtual announcement of the Sister City relationship. A video is expected to be posted at or before <chron>10 a.m. Monday</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Sponsorship of the video and celebration is shared jointly with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Town of Norwood</location> and the town's <org>Veterans of Foreign Wars</org> post, the James P. Lowder Post No. 6183.</p>\n\n<p>Monday will see the people of Jouarre honor the person for whom <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood's</location> <org>VFW Post</org> is named, Lt. <person>James Paul Lowder Jr</person>., who died <chron>July 8, 1944</chron>, while flying a P-51 Mustang fighter plane during World War II. The plane crashed in a forest close to Jouarre.</p>\n\n<p>To honor Lowder's sacrifice in helping to free <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location>, the citizens of Jouarre honored the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood</location> native with a memorial stone in the town's cemetery. Lowder is not buried in Jouarre, but at the <location>Epinal American Cemetery</location> in Dinoz&#233;.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is our cherished hope that our Sister City affiliation with Jouarre will nurture and bloom over time into genuine collaboration with cultural and personal exchanges, virtual and in person, with mutual benefits to citizens, and especially the youth, of our two communities,\" Young said. \"We are aware that such collaboration must be founded on citizen initiatives and involvement.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Norwood Sister City poster and flyer were designed by <person>Robert Patterson</person>, a retired principal with <org>Stanly County Schools</org>.</p>\n\n<p>The post <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.norood\">Norwood</location> celebrates <chron>Memorial Day</chron> with virtual videos, announces new sister city appeared first on <org>The Stanly News &amp; Press</org>.</p>",
