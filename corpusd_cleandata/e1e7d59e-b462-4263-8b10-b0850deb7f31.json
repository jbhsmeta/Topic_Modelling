    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Chemicals &\nChemistry Daily Daily \\-- New study results on catalysis research have been\npublished. According to news reporting originating from Tokyo, Japan, by\nNewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Developing a novel ammonia synthesis\nprocess from N [ [2] ] and H [ [2] ] is of interest to the catalysis and\nhydrogen research communities. g-Alumina-supported nickel was determined\ncapable of serving as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis using\nnonthermal plasma under atmospheric pressure without heating. The catalytic\nactivity was almost unrelated to the crystal structure and the surface area of\nthe alumina carrier.\"\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Waseda\nUniversity: \"The activity of Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] was quantitatively\ncompared with that of Fe/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] and Ru/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] ,\nwhich contained active metals for the conventional Haber-Bosch process. The\nactivity sequence was Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] > Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] > Fe/Al [\n[2] ] O [ [3] ] > no additive > Ru/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] , surprisingly\nindicating that the loading of Fe and Ru decreased the activity of Al [ [2] ]\nO [ [3] ]. The catalytic activity of Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] was dependent on\nthe amount of loaded Ni, the calcination temperature, and the reaction time.\nXRD, visual, and XPS observations of the catalysts before the plasma reaction\nindicated the generation of NiO and NiAl [ [2] ] O [ [4] ] on Al [ [2] ] O [\n[3] ] , the latter of which was generated upon high-temperature calcination.\nThe NiO species was readily reduced to Ni metal in the plasma reaction,\nwhereas the NiAl [ [2] ] O [ [4] ] species was difficult to reduce. The\ncatalytic behavior could be attributed to the production of fine Ni metal\nparticles that served as active sites.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The P [ [N2] ] /P [\n[H2] ] ratio dependence and rate constants of formation and decomposition of\nammonia were finally determined for 5.0 wt % Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] calcined\nat 773 K. The ammonia yield was 6.3% at an applied voltage of 6.0 kV, a\nresidence time of reactant gases of 0.12 min, and P [ [H2] ] /P [ [N2 ] ] =\n1.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Higher Activity of Ni/g-Al [ [2] ]\nO [ [3] ] over Fe/g-Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] and Ru/g-Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] for\nCatalytic Ammonia Synthesis in Nonthermal Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma of N [\n[2] ] and H [ [2] ]. _Catalysts_ , 2020,10(590):590.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Chemicals &amp; Chemistry Daily Daily</org> -- New study results on catalysis research have been published. According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/jp..tokyo\">Tokyo, Japan</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Developing a novel ammonia synthesis process from N [ [2] ] and H [ [2] ] is of interest to the catalysis and hydrogen research communities. g-Alumina-supported nickel was determined capable of serving as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis using nonthermal plasma under atmospheric pressure without heating. The catalytic activity was almost unrelated to the crystal structure and the surface area of the alumina carrier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1547131168\">Waseda University</org>: &#8220;The activity of Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] was quantitatively compared with that of Fe/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] and Ru/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] , which contained active metals for the conventional Haber-Bosch process. The activity sequence was Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] &gt; Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] &gt; Fe/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] &gt; no additive &gt; Ru/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] , surprisingly indicating that the loading of Fe and Ru decreased the activity of Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ]. The catalytic activity of Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] was dependent on the amount of loaded Ni, the calcination temperature, and the reaction time. XRD, visual, and XPS observations of the catalysts before the plasma reaction indicated the generation of NiO and NiAl [ [2] ] O [ [4] ] on Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] , the latter of which was generated upon high-temperature calcination. The NiO species was readily reduced to Ni metal in the plasma reaction, whereas the NiAl [ [2] ] O [ [4] ] species was difficult to reduce. The catalytic behavior could be attributed to the production of fine Ni metal particles that served as active sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;The P [ [N2] ] /P [ [H2] ] ratio dependence and rate constants of formation and decomposition of ammonia were finally determined for 5.0 wt % Ni/Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] calcined at 773 K. The ammonia yield was 6.3% at an applied voltage of 6.0 kV, a residence time of reactant gases of 0.12 min, and P [ [H2] ] /P [ [N2 ] ] = 1.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Higher Activity of Ni/g-Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] over Fe/g-Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] and Ru/g-Al [ [2] ] O [ [3] ] for Catalytic Ammonia Synthesis in Nonthermal Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma of N [ [2] ] and H [ [2] ]. <em>Catalysts</em>, 2020,10(590):590.
