    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Policy\nand Law Daily \\-- New study results on archaeology have been published.\nAccording to news reporting out of South Ural State University by NewsRx\neditors, research stated, \"This article is focused on the problem of formation\nand development of \u00abChinese markets\u00bb. Most of the aca-demic texts on the issue\nare based on materials from the Irkutsk \u00abShanghai\u00bb market.\"\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from South Ural State\nUniversity: \"\u00abChinese markets\u00bb of the Ural cities have not been explored. The\npurpose of this manuscript is to trace the formation and development of ideas\nabout the \u00abChinese market\u00bb among the residents of a large Ural city using the\nexample of Chelyabinsk. The source base includes the author's personal\nobservations made in the Chinatown area (vicinity of the \u00abZare-chny Market\u00bb),\narchival documents on migration and trade between China and Chelyabinsk\nOblast. In 2019 the author gathered interviews with consumers of the \u00abChinese\u00bb\nmarket, apartment owners who rented out housing to the Chinese, and market\nworkers. The Chelyabinsk and all-Russian press are important sources for\nstudying public opinion regarding the \u00abChinese\u00bb markets. The complexity of the\nstudy object resulted in the use of a com-plex of methods. These are free\ninformal interviews with city dwellers, included observation in the \u00abChinese\nmar-ket\u00bb, analysis of press content and discourse. Our study of perception of\nthe \u00abChinese market\u00bb showed a lot in common between the emergence of \u00abChinese\nmarkets\u00bb, and, most importantly, the reaction of the host commu-nity in\nChelyabinsk and Siberian cities to this process. In the media discourse and in\nthe mass consciousness of the townspeople, ideas about the \u00abChinese market\u00bb\ncreated an image of a \u00abChinatown\u00bb and a large number of Chinese migrants.\nAround the market, a complex of perceptions of threats has been formed (crime,\ntax evasion, low-quality goods, etc.). The Chinese market has formed complex\nnetworks of social relations between traders and consumers, the host society\nand migrants.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The term of \u00abChinese\nmarket\u00bb has incorporated a large number of meanings that are understandable\nwithout additional explanation: from organization of urban space to a set of\nmarkers that determine social status. Today, the \u00abChinese market\u00bb is the image\nof the \u00abEast\u00bb for citizens, where different ethnic groups, borders, and\ncultures are intertwined.\"\n\nA free version of this journal article is available at\n<https://doi.org/10.20874/2071-0437-2020-49-2-13>.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting A.A. Avdashkin, South Ural State University.\n\n(Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around\nthe world.)",

According to news reporting out of <org>South Ural State University</org> by NewsRx editors, research stated, &#8220;This article is focused on the problem of formation and development of &#171;Chinese markets&#187;. Most of the aca-demic texts on the issue are based on materials from the Irkutsk &#171;Shanghai&#187; market.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from <org>South Ural State University</org>: &#8220;&#171;Chinese markets&#187; of the Ural cities have not been explored. The purpose of this manuscript is to trace the formation and development of ideas about the &#171;Chinese market&#187; among the residents of a large Ural city using the example of Chelyabinsk. The source base includes the author&#8217;s personal observations made in the <location>Chinatown</location> area (vicinity of the &#171;Zare-chny Market&#187;), archival documents on migration and trade between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and Chelyabinsk Oblast. In 2019 the author gathered interviews with consumers of the &#171;Chinese&#187; market, apartment owners who rented out housing to the Chinese, and market workers. The Chelyabinsk and all-Russian press are important sources for studying public opinion regarding the &#171;Chinese&#187; markets. The complexity of the study object resulted in the use of a com-plex of methods. These are free informal interviews with city dwellers, included observation in the &#171;Chinese mar-ket&#187;, analysis of press content and discourse. Our study of perception of the &#171;Chinese market&#187; showed a lot in common between the emergence of &#171;Chinese markets&#187;, and, most importantly, the reaction of the host commu-nity in Chelyabinsk and Siberian cities to this process. In the media discourse and in the mass consciousness of the townspeople, ideas about the &#171;Chinese market&#187; created an image of a &#171;Chinatown&#187; and a large number of Chinese migrants. Around the market, a complex of perceptions of threats has been formed (crime, tax evasion, low-quality goods, etc.). The Chinese market has formed complex networks of social relations between traders and consumers, the host society and migrants.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;The term of &#171;Chinese market&#187; has incorporated a large number of meanings that are understandable without additional explanation: from organization of urban space to a set of markers that determine social status. Today, the &#171;Chinese market&#187; is the image of the &#171;East&#187; for citizens, where different ethnic groups, borders, and cultures are intertwined.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A free version of this journal article is available at <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.20874/2071-0437-2020-49-2-13\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.20874/2071-0437-2020-49-2-13</a>.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.A.
