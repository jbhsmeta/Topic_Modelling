    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology\nBusiness Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from Washington,\nD.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors LIN, Hsin-\nChieh (Taoyuan City, Taiwan); CHANG, Chih (Taichung City, Taiwan); LAI, Chin\nPen (Minxiong Township, Taiwan); CHENG, Wang-Chin (Zhubei City, Taiwan), filed\non October 21, 2019, was made available online on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent application is Industrial Technology Research\nInstitute (Hsinchu, Taiwan).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"In recent years, implantable devices have\nflourished in the biomedical field, and the global market for implantable\nmedical devices has also grown rapidly. Implantable medical devices can be\nused in clinical applications to diagnose epidemic diseases, detect early-\nstage cancers, and monitor chronic diseases in the long term. Generally,\nprobes made of metal materials are often used to convert biological signals in\nthe body into readable signals. Among them, gold and platinum have high\nconductivity, ductility, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance, and\ntherefore they are considered suitable materials for producing probes or\nelectrodes for in vivo detection.\n\n\"However, biofouling and biological adhesion issues can occur easily due to\nthe contact of implantable devices with tissues in the body, which may cause a\nmalfunction or dysfunction of the implanted devices. In order to prolong the\nservice life of the implantable devices and improve their performance, demand\nfor anti-nonspecific biological adhesion ability of the device surface\n(especially the surface of the conductive structure) is increasing.\n\n\"The methods that are commonly used include decorating and modifying the\nsurface of the probe electrode with a modification material to improve the\nanti-biofouling ability. The modification methods are mainly physical\nmodifications, e.g., the modification materials are physically attached to the\nsurface of the probe electrode. However, the impedance is high, and the\nmodification materials are easy to fall off with time, which may not only\ncause health concerns for patients but gradually decrease the signal\nsensitivity. Therefore, the probe electrode that is modified with such a\nmanner may be not suitable for long-term biomedical detection applications.\n\n\"As described above, although currently existing conductive structures for\nimplantable devices have been substantially adequate for their intended\npurposes, they have not been satisfactory in the needs of long-term\nimplantation.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this\npatent application: \"In accordance with some embodiments of the present\ndisclosure, a modified conductive structure is provided.

Implantable medical devices can be used in clinical applications to diagnose epidemic diseases, detect early-stage cancers, and monitor chronic diseases in the long term. Generally, probes made of metal materials are often used to convert biological signals in the body into readable signals. Among them, gold and platinum have high conductivity, ductility, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance, and therefore they are considered suitable materials for producing probes or electrodes for in vivo detection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, biofouling and biological adhesion issues can occur easily due to the contact of implantable devices with tissues in the body, which may cause a malfunction or dysfunction of the implanted devices. In order to prolong the service life of the implantable devices and improve their performance, demand for anti-nonspecific biological adhesion ability of the device surface (especially the surface of the conductive structure) is increasing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The methods that are commonly used include decorating and modifying the surface of the probe electrode with a modification material to improve the anti-biofouling ability. The modification methods are mainly physical modifications, e.g., the modification materials are physically attached to the surface of the probe electrode. However, the impedance is high, and the modification materials are easy to fall off with time, which may not only cause health concerns for patients but gradually decrease the signal sensitivity. Therefore, the probe electrode that is modified with such a manner may be not suitable for long-term biomedical detection applications.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As described above, although currently existing conductive structures for implantable devices have been substantially adequate for their intended purposes, they have not been satisfactory in the needs of long-term implantation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;In accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure, a modified conductive structure is provided.
