    "text": "\"White silence is white compliance.\"\n\nThat chant, and others were uttered in Nocatee on Tuesday night by nearly 200\nprotesters. An amalgamation of families, teens and young adults demonstrated\nat the corner of Crosswater Parkway and Nocatee Village Drive for nearly 90\nminutes to protest the death of 46-year-old George Floyd.\n\nFloyd, 46, died following an interaction with a Minneapolis police officer on\nMay 25. An independent autopsy report that was released on Monday, found Floyd\ndied due to \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\".\n\nTuesday was the fourth day of demonstrations in St. Johns County after Floyd\nwas killed. The previous protests were in downtown St. Augustine.\n\nNocatee is a suburb of Jacksonville near the Duval-St. Johns County border\nthat, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is more than 90% white.\n\nWhile protesters chanted \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"When black lives are under\nattack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back\" and more, there was a conscious\neffort by those in attendance to recognize that demonstrations about Floyd's\ndeath -- and other instances of police brutality -- cannot solely be held made\nby African-Americans. One protester went as far to defer to Kaleigh Baker and\nJasmine Hurt instead of sharing her perspective.\n\nHurt was the first African-American to be named Miss Ponte Vedra in 2019.\nBaker, 18, said protesting is the first step in ensuring her generation\noverthrows systematic racism and dismantles police brutality.\n\nBaker and Hurt were joined by their friends and high school classmates Chase\nMasnano, Emma Merlini, Stella Humbers and Lakshoy Goyal. The sextet, all of\nwhom graduated from Ponte Vedra High School this year, said voting is\nparamount but so is an understanding of American history so instances like\nFloyd's death can be placed into context.\n\n\"It's not the people who are in the KKK, it's the moderate individual who are\nblind to what's happening,\" Hurt said. \"They are not willing to be anti-\nracists.\"\n\nHumbers said protesting is one tactic she plans to use in her quest for\nchange. She added leveraging social media, voting and aligning with advocates\nare among her plans of action.\n\n\"I don't think kids know local government impacts their lives a lot,\" Hurt\nsaid. \"We have to make sure more young people vote in local elections.\"\n\nThe protest began at 6:30. For nearly an hour, people gathered on the public\nspaces along Crosswater Parkway holding signs and chanting. Not a minute\npassed where a motorist did not honk in support of their cause.\n\nAt approximately, 7:20, a driver in a red Cadillac disagreed with the\nprotesters and voiced her displeasure with those closest to the turning lane\nthat took her onto Nocatee Village Drive. Tensions flared, but the only thing\nexchanged were words.\n\nNo protesters touched the vehicle, and deputies with the St. Johns Sheriff's\nOffice quickly reminded the driver that those who gathered had a right to\nprotest. Deputies told the driver that if she wanted to protest, she was\nwelcome to return with her own signs, but she was not welcomed to aggressively\ndrive near other demonstrators.\n\nMore than one hundred people gathered at the intersection of Crosswater\nParkway and #Nocatee Village Drive to protest the killing of #GeorgeFloyd.\n\nThe protests were vociferous, but peaceful. This driver was accosted by SJSO\nafter aggressively barking back at the protesters.\n[pic.twitter.com/XGStdOfjlz](http://pic.twitter.com/XGStdOfjlz)\n\n-- Will Brown (@wwbrown19) June 2, 2020\n\nNo arrests were made during Tuesday's protest and the remaining moments did\nnot feature any altercations.\n\nNocatee resident Eric Addison said he is tired of having to worry from 6 a.m.\nto 8 p.m. about his sons \"being out and about and being harassed by cops.\nThat's a concern and that's what brought me out here. Enough is enough. We\nhave seen this over the years and over the decades of this happening to our\npeople. Enough is enough.\"\n\nAddison held a sign that featured the names, and date of death, of African-\nAmericans who were killed by police. Floyd's name was at the top of his\nposter; but the names of Stephon Clark, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Tamir\nRice and Laquan McDonald were all listed.\n\n\"That's what got me. It's too many. There shouldn't be any that die this way.\nIt's not just George Floyd. It's everyone, from decades ago. They all matter.\nIt's a buildup from the past to now. ...I think people eyes are open more now\nthan they ever have been before.\"",

    "html": "<p>\"White silence is white compliance.\"</p>\n<p>That chant, and others were uttered in Nocatee on Tuesday night by nearly 200 protesters. An amalgamation of families, teens and young adults demonstrated at the corner of <location>Crosswater Parkway</location> and <location>Nocatee Village Drive</location> for nearly 90 minutes to protest the death of 46-year-old <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd, 46, died following an interaction with a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer on <chron>May 25</chron>. An independent autopsy report that was released on Monday, found Floyd died due to \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\".</p>\n\n<p>Tuesday was the fourth day of demonstrations in St. Johns County after Floyd was killed. The previous protests were in downtown <person>St. Augustine</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Nocatee is a suburb of Jacksonville near the Duval-St. Johns County border that, according to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3314301120\">U.S. Census Bureau</org>, is more than 90% white.</p>\n\n<p>While protesters chanted \"<org>Black Lives Matter</org>,\" \"When black lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back\" and more, there was a conscious effort by those in attendance to recognize that demonstrations about Floyd's death &#8212; and other instances of police brutality &#8212; cannot solely be held made by African-Americans. One protester went as far to defer to <person>Kaleigh Baker</person> and <person>Jasmine Hurt</person> instead of sharing her perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Hurt was the first <org>African-American</org> to be named Miss <person>Ponte Vedra</person> in 2019. Baker, 18, said protesting is the first step in ensuring her generation overthrows systematic racism and dismantles police brutality.</p>\n\n<p>Baker and Hurt were joined by their friends and high school classmates Chase Masnano, <person>Emma Merlini</person>, Stella Humbers and Lakshoy Goyal. The sextet, all of whom graduated from <org>Ponte Vedra High School</org> this year, said voting is paramount but so is an understanding of American history so instances like Floyd's death can be placed into context.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not the people who are in the <org>KKK</org>, it's the moderate individual who are blind to what's happening,\" Hurt said. \"They are not willing to be anti-racists.\"</p>\n\n<p>Humbers said protesting is one tactic she plans to use in her quest for change. She added leveraging social media, voting and aligning with advocates are among her plans of action.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think kids know local government impacts their lives a lot,\" Hurt said. \"We have to make sure more young people vote in local elections.\"</p>\n\n<p>The protest began at 6:30. For nearly an hour, people gathered on the public spaces along <location>Crosswater Parkway</location> holding signs and chanting. Not a minute passed where a motorist did not honk in support of their cause.</p>\n\n<p>At approximately, 7:20, a driver in a red <org>Cadillac</org> disagreed with the protesters and voiced her displeasure with those closest to the turning lane that took her onto <location>Nocatee Village Drive</location>. Tensions flared, but the only thing exchanged were words.</p>\n\n<p>No protesters touched the vehicle, and deputies with the <org>St. Johns Sheriff's Office</org> quickly reminded the driver that those who gathered had a right to protest. Deputies told the driver that if she wanted to protest, she was welcome to return with her own signs, but she was not welcomed to aggressively drive near other demonstrators.</p>\n\n<p>More than one hundred people gathered at the intersection of <location>Crosswater Parkway</location> and #Nocatee Village Drive to protest the killing of #GeorgeFloyd.</p>\n\n<p>The protests were vociferous, but peaceful. This driver was accosted by SJSO after aggressively barking back at the protesters. <a href=\"http://pic.twitter.com/XGStdOfjlz\">pic.twitter.com/XGStdOfjlz</a></p>\n\n<p>&#8212; <person>Will Brown</person> (@wwbrown19) <chron>June 2, 2020</chron></p>\n\n<p>No arrests were made during Tuesday's protest and the remaining moments did not feature any altercations.</p>\n\n<p>Nocatee resident <person>Eric Addison</person> said he is tired of having to worry from <chron>6 a.m. to 8 p.m.</chron> about his sons \"being out and about and being harassed by cops. That's a concern and that's what brought me out here. Enough is enough. We have seen this over the years and over the decades of this happening to our people. Enough is enough.\"</p>\n\n<p>Addison held a sign that featured the names, and date of death, of African-Americans who were killed by police. Floyd's name was at the top of his poster; but the names of <person>Stephon Clark</person>, <person>Philando Castile</person>, <person>Eric Garner</person>, <person>Tamir Rice</person> and <person>Laquan McDonald</person> were all listed.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's what got me. It's too many. There shouldn't be any that die this way. It's not just <person>George Floyd</person>. It's everyone, from decades ago. They all matter. It's a buildup from the past to now. ...I think people eyes are open more now than they ever have been before.\"</p>",
