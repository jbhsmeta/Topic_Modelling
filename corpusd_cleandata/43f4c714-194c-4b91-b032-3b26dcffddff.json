    "text": "EPG (brand name: Epogee) - a new plant-based oil that has been restructured in\nsuch a way that virtually none of it is absorbed by the body - is attracting\ninterest from formulators across the food industry, as firms see an\nopportunity to make significant calorie reductions without compromising on\ntaste or texture, claims the firm.\n\nProducts already on the market containing [**Epogee**\n\u200b](https://www.epogee.com/#about)\u200b include enrobed caramel clusters and a\nfast-growing low-calorie ice cream brand delivering a _ \"super-premium creamy\nmouthfeel,\"_\u200b Epogee chief commercial officer Jayme Caruso told reporters in a\nbriefing on Wednesday.\n\n_\" We have a customer about to launch a peanut spread and a chocolate hazelnut\nspread with EPG and we expect to see many more products hitting the market\nwith EPG in the coming months.\"_\u200b\n\n###  **Ingredients listing: EPG (modified plant-based oil)** \u200b\n\nEPG (esterified propoxylated glycerol) - which be listed on food labels as\n'EPG (modified plant-based oil)' \\- can be used to replace up to 85% of the\nfat in scores of applications from confectionery to baking mixes, said Caruso,\nwho said the FDA had just confirmed it had no objections to extending a GRAS\ndetermination for EPG to include potato chips, corn-based savory snacks,\nchicken nuggets, plant-based protein products, dairy analogs, and\nbeverages/beverage bases.\n\n###  **1g of Epogee contains 0.7 calories** \u200b\n\nTo make EPG, the company splits rapeseed oil (although other vegetable oils\ncan also be used) into glycerin and fatty acid, inserts a food-grade link, and\nreconnects them (see box below for details).\n\nThe modified fat (EPG) has a high melting point of 102\u02daF, which means that it\ndoesn't liquify when it passes through the body (which typically has a\ntemperature of around 98.6\u02daF) and has \" _the consistency of soft candlewax, \"\n_\u200bCaruso told FoodNavigator-USA.\n\nIt largely resists digestion because digestive enzymes are prevented from\nbreaking it down, so hardly any of its calories are released, added Caruso,\nwho is talking to potential partners from leading CPG brands to 'disruptive'\nstartups.\n\nTo put this into perspective, 1g of fat contains 9 calories, while 1g of\nEpogee contains 0.7 calories.\n\n###  **No messy side effects \u2026**\u200b\n\nUnlike Olestra (which had a lower melting point and messy side effects) or fat\nreplacers made from sugars, gums, starches or fibers (which provide bulking,\nhumectancy and mouthfeel but many firms don't want to include on the\ningredients list), EPG functions like fat in food products and in the human\nbody because it's made from fat _,_ \u200bsaid Caruso.\n\n\" _In a nutshell, \" _\u200bhe said, EPG is unique in the food formulation space\nbecause it's an _ \"alternative fat, not a fat 'substitute'\u2026 EPG looks feels,\ntastes, and functions like fat because it's made from fat, it just doesn't\ndeliver the calories.\"_\u200b\n\n###  **' EPG looks feels, tastes, and functions like fat because it's made\nfrom fat'**\u200b\n\nWhile fat reduction and replacement might have been all the rage in the 80s\nand 90s, consumers today - some of whom are actively embracing high fat keto\ndiets - are more worried about sugar, acknowledged Caruso.\n\nBut they're also worried about their weight, and they are still paying\nattention to calories, and given that fat contains a lot more calories per\ngram (9) than carbs or protein (4), it is \" _the easiest target to drive\ncalories out of products, \" _\u200bhe said.\n\n\" _The low-fat ship sailed 25 years ago, but this is not about low fat, it 's\nabout caloric reduction.\"_\u200b\n\n###  **' There is currently nothing like this is on the market'**\u200b\n\nAnd if food culture has undoubtedly changed since the technology behind EPGs\nwas first developed three decades ago, most Americans are still consuming more\ncalories than they are burning off, and many of them come from fat, added\nCaruso.\n\n_' There is currently nothing like this is on the market. We have two\nproducts, a confectionery EPG with a very sharp melting curve designed to\nmimic cocoa butter or fractionated palm kernel oil, and our workhorse\nspreadable EPG, which works in all of the other applications.\"_\u200b\n\nAs to whether EPG would be considered 'clean label,' there's no simple answer\nas this is not a legally defined term, said Caruso, although he conceded that\nsome natural and organic brands might not be interested.\n\nHowever, brands that are trying to appeal to calorie-conscious consumers are\nparticularly excited by Epogee's potential to cut calories but also eliminate\ningredients such as gums, starches and binders, preservatives and flavor\nenhancers that are often used in low calorie or low fat foods, he said.",

    "html": "<p>EPG (brand name: Epogee) &#8211; a new plant-based oil that has been restructured in such a way that virtually none of it is absorbed by the body &#8211; is attracting interest from formulators across the food industry, as firms see an opportunity to make significant calorie reductions without compromising on taste or texture, claims the firm.</p>\n    <p>Products already on the market containing <a href=\"https://www.epogee.com/#about\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Epogee</strong>&#8203;</a>&#8203;&#160;include enrobed caramel clusters and a fast-growing low-calorie ice cream brand delivering a<em>&#160;&#8220;super-premium creamy mouthfeel,&#8221;</em>&#8203;&#160;Epogee chief commercial officer <person>Jayme Caruso</person> told reporters in a briefing on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p><em>&#8220;We have a customer about to launch a peanut spread and a chocolate hazelnut spread with EPG and we expect to see many more products hitting the market with EPG in the coming months.&#8221;</em>&#8203;</p>\n    <h3>\n<strong>Ingredients listing: EPG (modified plant-based oil)</strong>&#8203;</h3>\n    <p>EPG (esterified propoxylated glycerol) &#8211; which be listed on food labels as &#8216;EPG (modified plant-based oil)&#8217; - can be used to replace up to 85% of the fat in scores of applications from confectionery to baking mixes, said Caruso, who said the FDA had just confirmed it had no objections to extending a GRAS determination for EPG to include potato chips, corn-based savory snacks, chicken nuggets, plant-based protein products, dairy analogs, and beverages/beverage bases.&#160;&#160;</p>\n    <h3>\n<strong>1g of Epogee contains 0.7 calories</strong>&#8203;</h3>\n    <p>To make EPG, the company splits rapeseed oil (although other vegetable oils can also be used) into glycerin and fatty acid, inserts a food-grade link, and reconnects them (see box below for details).</p>\n    <p>The modified fat (EPG) has a high melting point of 102&#730;F, which means that it doesn&#8217;t liquify when it passes through the body (which typically has a temperature of around 98.6&#730;F) and has &#8220;<em>the consistency of soft candlewax,&#8221; </em>&#8203;Caruso told <org>FoodNavigator-USA</org>.</p>\n    <p>It largely resists digestion because digestive enzymes are prevented from breaking it down, so hardly any of its calories are released, added Caruso, who is talking to potential partners from leading CPG brands to &#8216;disruptive&#8217; startups.</p>\n    <p>To put this into perspective, 1g of fat contains 9 calories, while 1g of Epogee contains 0.7 calories.</p>\n    <h3>\n<strong>No messy side effects&#8230;</strong>&#8203;</h3>\n    <p>Unlike Olestra (which had a lower melting point and messy side effects) or fat replacers made from sugars, gums, starches or fibers (which provide bulking, humectancy and mouthfeel but many firms don&#8217;t want to include on the ingredients list), EPG functions like fat in food products and in the human body because it&#8217;s made from fat<em>, </em>&#8203;said Caruso.</p>\n    <p>&#8220;<em>In a nutshell,&#8221; </em>&#8203;he said, EPG is unique in the food formulation space because it&#8217;s an<em>&#160;&#8220;alternative fat, not a fat &#8216;substitute&#8217;&#8230; EPG looks feels, tastes, and functions like fat because it&#8217;s made from fat, it just doesn&#8217;t deliver the calories.&#8221;</em>&#8203;</p>\n    <h3>\n<strong>&#8216;EPG looks feels, tastes, and functions like fat because it&#8217;s made from fat&#8217;</strong>&#8203;</h3>\n    <p>While fat reduction and replacement might have been all the rage in the 80s and 90s, consumers today &#8211; some of whom are actively embracing high fat keto diets &#8211; are more worried about sugar, acknowledged Caruso.</p>\n    <p>But they&#8217;re also worried about their weight, and they are still paying attention to calories, and given that fat contains a lot more calories per gram (9) than carbs or protein (4), it is &#8220;<em>the easiest target to drive calories out of products,&#8221; </em>&#8203;he said.</p>\n    <p>&#8220;<em>The low-fat ship sailed 25 years ago, but this is not about low fat, it&#8217;s about caloric reduction.&#8221;</em>&#8203;</p>\n    <h3>\n<strong>&#8216;There is currently nothing like this is on the market&#8217;</strong>&#8203;</h3>\n    <p>And if food culture has undoubtedly changed since the technology behind EPGs was first developed three decades ago, most Americans are still consuming more calories than they are burning off, and many of them come from fat, added Caruso.</p>\n    <p><em>&#8216;There is currently nothing like this is on the market. We have two products, a confectionery EPG with a very sharp melting curve designed to mimic cocoa butter or fractionated palm kernel oil, and our workhorse spreadable EPG, which works in all of the other applications.&#8221;</em>&#8203;</p>\n    <p>As to whether EPG would be considered &#8216;clean label,&#8217; there&#8217;s no simple answer as this is not a legally defined term, said Caruso, although he conceded that some natural and organic brands might not be interested.</p>\n    <p>However, brands that are trying to appeal to calorie-conscious consumers are particularly excited by Epogee's potential to cut calories but also eliminate ingredients such as gums, starches and binders, preservatives and flavor enhancers that are often used in low calorie or low fat foods, he said.</p>",
