He was out for 30 minutes,\" said\nEmin Aghayev, a delivery driver at the local pizza shop Bklyn's Pizza.\n\nBensonhurst native Jon Graves stumbled on the white Mazda sedan, sporting the\nflimsy blue tape and out-of-state license plates, on 86th Street near 14th\nAvenue on the border of Bath Beach and Bensonhurst on May 24. He said he first\nthought it was either a prop for the pie shop or a way for deliverers to more\nquickly get through traffic.\n\n\"I was really surprised [ ] I thought it might be placeholder,\" Graves said.\n\"Maybe if they were going through traffic they could get through faster.\"\n\nHe posted a picture of it on Facebook later that day, which was shared almost\n1,000 times on the site within 48 hours and made its way to the Brooklyn\nsubreddit, where commenters wondered whether it would cause problems for the\ndriver, with one forum commenter imagining the driver being pulled over by\ncops and saying, \"No, officer. It stands for New York Pizza Delivery.\"\n\nSAW THIS IN BENSONHURST, BROOKLYN TODAYSCREAMINGGG\n\nPosted by Jon Graves on Sunday, May 24, 2020\n\nLocal councilman Justin Brannan chimed in on Twitter on Monday, simply saying,\n\"Seems legit.\"\n\nWhile state law considers impersonating a police officer a class E felony, the\nPolice Department did not respond to a request for comment as to whether that\nmakeshift marking would be convincing enough to warrant any charges.\n\nAghayev later took the tape back off, but said that his boss saw the humor in\nit.\n\n\"He was laughing,\" said the prankster.",

He was out for 30 minutes,\" said <person>Emin Aghayev</person>, a delivery driver at the local pizza shop Bklyn's Pizza.</p>\n\n<p>Bensonhurst native <person>Jon Graves</person> stumbled on the white <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Tokyo:7261\">Mazda</org> sedan, sporting the flimsy blue tape and out-of-state license plates, on <location>86th Street</location> near <location>14th Avenue</location> on the border of Bath Beach and Bensonhurst on <chron>May 24</chron>. He said he first thought it was either a prop for the pie shop or a way for deliverers to more quickly get through traffic.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was really surprised [&#133;] I thought it might be placeholder,\" Graves said. \"Maybe if they were going through traffic they could get through faster.\"</p>\n\n<p>He posted a picture of it on Facebook later that day, which was shared almost 1,000 times on the site within 48 hours and made its way to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.brklyn\">Brooklyn</location> subreddit, where commenters wondered whether it would cause problems for the driver, with one forum commenter imagining the driver being pulled over by cops and saying, \"No, officer. It stands for New York Pizza Delivery.\"</p>\n\n<p>SAW THIS IN BENSONHURST, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.brklyn\">BROOKLYN</location> TODAYSCREAMINGGG</p>\n\n<p>Posted by <person>Jon Graves</person> on <chron>Sunday, May 24, 2020</chron></p>\n\n<p>Local councilman <person>Justin Brannan</person> chimed in on Twitter on Monday, simply saying, \"Seems legit.\"</p>\n\n<p>While state law considers impersonating a police officer a class E felony, the <org>Police Department</org> did not respond to a request for comment as to whether that makeshift marking would be convincing enough to warrant any charges.</p>\n\n<p>Aghayev later took the tape back off, but said that his boss saw the humor in it.</p>\n\n<p>\"He was laughing,\" said the prankster.</p>",
