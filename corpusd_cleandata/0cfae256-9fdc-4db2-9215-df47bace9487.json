    "text": "John Hawkins/Stuff Locator Beacon Charitable Trust chair John Munro says\nbeacons are essential.An expensive 10-day search for missing trampers near\ncould have been resolved much quicker if they had spent $30 and hired a\nlocator beacon. Locator Beacon Charitable Trust chair John Munro said had\nrescued trampers Dion Reynolds and Jessica O'Connor had a beacon with them,\nand had set it off, he believed they would have been rescued within\nhours.\"...it [search and rescue operation] would have cost maybe $10,000 ...a\nbeacon had the potential to save lives and secondly, taxpayer dollars,\" he\nsaid.The Area Locator Beacon Charitable Trust operates in the area O'Connor\nand Reynolds departed from.READ MORE:Rescued tramper Dion Reynolds' 'surreal\nexperience' of 19 days in bushTrampers Jessica O'Connor and Dion Reynolds\nfound alive after 19 days missingFamilies, friends of missing trampers 'take\nsolace' in rescue team's efforts\"They could have hired one. Thirty dollars for\na week,\" Munro said.Munro would like to see information for going into the\nforest and the use of beacons placed on inbound flights to New Zealand for\nvisitors to read.The trust was established in 1996 and its for-purchase or\nhire beacons have been involved in more than 600 rescues.In May, Dion Reynolds\nand Jess O'Connor survived 19 days in the Kahurangi Park in Anatori, west of .\nThey went 13 days without food and did not have a locator beacon.It was\nfantastic Reynolds and O'Connor were found, Munro said.Braden Fastier/StuffAir\nForce NH 90 crew that rescued Dion Reynolds and Jessica O'Connor who were\nmissing for 19 days in the Kahurangi Park.\"My concern is that they have been\npraised for having the right equipment with them, and to a certain extent yes\nthey did, but one of the essential items that they should always take with\nthem is a personal locator beacon.\"He estimated the ten-day search would have\ncost about $1million.\"They put so many people's lives at risk, during\nlockdown, which was a huge no-no.\"They should be held accountable for their\nwrong-doing, they should have been charged.Overnight trips were not allowed\nduring Alert Level 3, in effect on May 8 when they departed, however they were\nnot charged with breaking lockdown restrictions.Dion Reynolds and Jessica\nO'Connor arrive at Airport. The two were missing for 19 days in the Kahurangi\nPark.\"Irresponsible. They put so many other people's lives at risk, for the\ncost of a $30 locator beacon,\" Munro said.The search for a German man near the\nHump Ridge Track in 1994 cost about $365,000, excluding the cost to the army,\nMunro said.Munro said 95 per cent of the time, someone is saved within one\nhour of setting off a beacon.And again, he stressed that the secondary point\nto saving lives, was saving millions of taxpayer dollars.",
