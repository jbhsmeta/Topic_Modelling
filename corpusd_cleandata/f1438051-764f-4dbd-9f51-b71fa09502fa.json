    "text": "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights\nthat lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We're all stuck\nat home at the moment, so here are the50 best movies on Netflix right nowWho\nLet 'Mad Dog' Out?On Wednesday, the former defense secretaryJim Mattis\ncriticized President Trump's handling of the nationwide protests over police\nviolence,\"Replied Trump, 'I know you are, but what am I?'\" Seth Meyers said on\nThursday's \"Late Night.\"Mattis resigned in 2018, thoughTrump claimed this week\nto have fired him\"OK, first of all, he resigned, you didn't fire him. Second,\nyou didn't come up with the name 'Mad Dog' -- he's had it since at least 2004\nand we know you didn't come up with it because it's a cool nickname and your\nnicknames suck. Sorry. Sorry, dude. If you come up with a nickname for him, it\nwould have been something like 'Lame James' or 'Jumpin' Jim.'\"-- SETH\nMEYERS\"What a strange thing to lie about. It's so easily disproved. Remember\nthe movie 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion' where they lie and say they\ninvented Post-it notes? It's like that, but from the president.\"-- JIMMY\nKIMMEL\"Mattis added that 'We must not be distracted by a small number of\nlawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of\nconscience who are insisting that we live up to our values -- our values as\npeople and our values as a nation.' That is a stirring message of compassion,\nunity, and reason from -- 'Mad Dog'? I hereby rename you 'Principled\nPooch.'\"-- STEPHEN COLBERT\"In a statement, General Mattis said, 'Donald Trump\nis the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American\npeople, does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us.' Trump\nsaw that and was like, 'Why don't you be a man and tweet that to my face?'\"--\nJIMMY FALLONThe Punchiest Punchlines (Fence Me In Edition)\"Trump denied he's\ntrying to divide us. Then he added more fencing between him and the\nprotesters.\"\"Yep, Trump is trying to protect the White House. He even ran\naround putting broken Christmas ornaments under windows and tying rope to\npaint cans to swing over the staircase.\"\"Authorities there are busy erecting\nanother fence that will go around the existing White House fence, which will\nmake two fences, which I think was a Spin Doctors song. So it looks like Trump\nis finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out Don\nJr. invested in a fence company?\"\"I always said, 'I wish the White House\nlooked like a Little League backstop.'\"\"So far, Trump has turned off the White\nHouse lights, hid in a bunker and is now building an ugly chain link fence.\nHe's like every crazy neighbor rolled into one.\"The Bits Worth WatchingThe\n\"Late Show\" writer Olivia Harewood helped James Corden locate his white\nprivilege and told him to harness his powers for good.Also, Check This\nOutImageMichaela Coel is the creator and star of \"I May Destroy You,\"\npremiering Sunday on HBO.Credit...Michaela Coel, star of \"Chewing Gum,\" plays\na young woman coming to terms with trauma in hernew coming-of-age HBO series,\n\"I May Destroy You.\"",

    "html": "<p>Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night&#8217;s highlights that lets you sleep &#8212; and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We&#8217;re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the50 best movies on Netflix right nowWho Let &#8216;Mad Dog&#8217; Out?On Wednesday, the former defense secretaryJim Mattis criticized President Trump&#8217;s handling of the nationwide protests over police violence,&#8220;Replied Trump, &#8216;I know you are, but what am I?&#8217;&#8221; <person>Seth Meyers</person> said on Thursday&#8217;s &#8220;Late Night.&#8221;Mattis resigned in 2018, thoughTrump claimed this week to have fired him&#8220;OK, first of all, he resigned, you didn&#8217;t fire him. Second, you didn&#8217;t come up with the name &#8216;Mad Dog&#8217; &#8212; he&#8217;s had it since at least 2004 and we know you didn&#8217;t come up with it because it&#8217;s a cool nickname and your nicknames suck. Sorry. Sorry, dude. If you come up with a nickname for him, it would have been something like &#8216;Lame James&#8217; or &#8216;Jumpin&#8217; Jim.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212; SETH MEYERS&#8220;What a strange thing to lie about. It&#8217;s so easily disproved. Remember the movie &#8216;Romy and Michele&#8217;s High School Reunion&#8217; where they lie and say they invented Post-it notes? It&#8217;s like that, but from the president.&#8221;&#8212; JIMMY KIMMEL&#8220;Mattis added that &#8216;We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values &#8212; our values as people and our values as a nation.&#8217; That is a stirring message of compassion, unity, and reason from &#8212; &#8216;Mad Dog&#8217;? I hereby rename you &#8216;Principled Pooch.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212; STEPHEN COLBERT&#8220;In a statement, <person>General Mattis</person> said, &#8216;Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people, does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us.&#8217; Trump saw that and was like, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you be a man and tweet that to my face?&#8217;&#8221;&#8212; JIMMY FALLONThe Punchiest Punchlines (Fence Me In Edition)&#8220;Trump denied he&#8217;s trying to divide us. Then he added more fencing between him and the protesters.&#8221;&#8220;Yep, Trump is trying to protect the <org>White House</org>. He even ran around putting broken Christmas ornaments under windows and tying rope to paint cans to swing over the staircase.&#8221;&#8220;Authorities there are busy erecting another fence that will go around the existing <org>White House</org> fence, which will make two fences, which I think was a Spin Doctors song. So it looks like Trump is finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out <person>Don Jr</person>. invested in a fence company?\"&#8220;I always said, &#8216;I wish the <org>White House</org> looked like a <org>Little League</org> backstop.&#8217;&#8221;&#8220;So far, Trump has turned off the <org>White House</org> lights, hid in a bunker and is now building an ugly chain link fence. He&#8217;s like every crazy neighbor rolled into one.&#8221;The Bits Worth WatchingThe &#8220;Late Show&#8221; writer <person>Olivia Harewood</person> helped <person>James Corden</person> locate his white privilege and told him to harness his powers for good.Also, Check This OutImageMichaela Coel is the creator and star of &#8220;I May Destroy You,&#8221; premiering Sunday on HBO.Credit...<person>Michaela Coel</person>, star of &#8220;Chewing Gum,&#8221; plays a young woman coming to terms with trauma in hernew coming-of-age <org>HBO</org> series, &#8220;I May Destroy You.&#8221;</p>",
