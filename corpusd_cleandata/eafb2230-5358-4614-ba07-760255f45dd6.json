    "text": "Details on next-gen standard arrive as DOCSIS 3.1 handles strains of COVID-19\n\nCableLabs has published the anticipated specifications for DOCSIS 4.0, the\nnext technology standard for moving data across the cable industrys hybrid\nfiber coaxial (HFC) networks.\n\nThe new specifications, an upgrade over the industrys current DOCSIS 3.1\nstandard, will enable cable systems to deliver download speeds of up to 10\ngigabits per second. Upstream speeds can approach speeds of 6 Gbps.\n\nImportantly, DOCSIS 4.0 unifies two competing technologies for moving HFC\nnetworks to 10-gig speeds. Full Duplex DOCSIS (FDX) would combine downstream\nand upstream signals on a single frequency, delivering symmetrical speeds up\nto 10 Gbps. FDX is favored by Comcast, but its stringent network technology\nrequirements made it economically infeasible for many operators.\n\nExtended Spectrum DOCSIS keeps upstream and downstream traffic separate. But\nit would increase the spectrum of HFC networks to 1.8 GHz from a current level\nof 1.2 GHz found on the fastest networks.\n\nWorking Towards 10G\n\nCableLabs is the technology consortium for the major U.S. cable companies. And\nits serving a broader cable industry initiative called 10G, an effort to\nmigrate cable networks to a future in which 10 Gbps speeds power increased\ncloud applications, video conferencing, smart homes and distance learning - a\nfuture that is, well, here today for many of us.\n\nDOCSIS 4.0 gives cable industry engineers in purchasing roles clarity on how\nto move forward in a network technology realm being disrupted by\nvirtualization and Distributed Access Architecture (DAA).\n\nWith the DOCSIS 4.0 specification establishing a clear path forward, giving\ncable operators the flexibility to pursue either Extended Spectrum DOCSIS\n(ESD) or Full Duplex DOCSIS (FDX), operators can move ahead with their remote\nPHY and remote MAC-PHY deployments to solve immediate headend and power\nconsumption issues, DellOro Group analyst Jeff Heynen wrote in a March blog\npost.\n\nBut dont look for commercial deployments of DOCSIS 4.0 networks by operators\nin the months to come. Cable operators still have a glut of network capacity\nfrom huge investments made over the last five years in DOCSIS 3.1\ninfrastructure. These buildups enabled them to offer customers 1 Gbps speeds,\nthe ceiling for which consumers are nowhere near bumping into just yet.\n\nCable's Net Holds Fast\n\nAnd the networks are holding up well to current capacity strains wrought by\nhomebound social distancing. Comcasts top technologist, president of\ntechnology and product Tony Werner, said the No. 1 cable companys networks are\nholding up just fine in locations like San Francisco and Seattle, which have\nseen traffic increases as high as 60% in peak weekend usage hours recently.\n\nUsage is on the rise as more people are working, learning and doing all their\nentertaining at home, Werner said on a March 30 call with reporters. But its\nall within the capability of the network.",

Upstream speeds can approach speeds of 6 Gbps.</p>\n<p>Importantly, DOCSIS 4.0 unifies two competing technologies for moving HFC networks to 10-gig speeds. Full Duplex DOCSIS (FDX) would combine downstream and upstream signals on a single frequency, delivering symmetrical speeds up to 10 Gbps. FDX is favored by Comcast, but its stringent network technology requirements made it economically infeasible for many operators.</p>\n<p>Extended Spectrum DOCSIS keeps upstream and downstream traffic separate. But it would increase the spectrum of HFC networks to 1.8 GHz from a current level of 1.2 GHz found on the fastest networks.</p>\n<p>Working Towards 10G</p>\n<p>CableLabs is the technology consortium for the major <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> cable companies. And its serving a broader cable industry initiative called 10G, an effort to migrate cable networks to a future in which 10 Gbps speeds power increased cloud applications, video conferencing, smart homes and distance learning - a future that is, well, here today for many of us.</p>\n<p>DOCSIS 4.0 gives cable industry engineers in purchasing roles clarity on how to move forward in a network technology realm being disrupted by virtualization and Distributed Access Architecture (DAA).</p>\n<p>With the DOCSIS 4.0 specification establishing a clear path forward, giving cable operators the flexibility to pursue either Extended Spectrum DOCSIS (ESD) or Full Duplex DOCSIS (FDX), operators can move ahead with their remote PHY and remote MAC-PHY deployments to solve immediate headend and power consumption issues, <org>DellOro Group</org> analyst <person>Jeff Heynen</person> wrote in a March blog post.</p>\n<p>But dont look for commercial deployments of DOCSIS 4.0 networks by operators in the months to come. Cable operators still have a glut of network capacity from huge investments made over the last five years in DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. These buildups enabled them to offer customers 1 Gbps speeds, the ceiling for which consumers are nowhere near bumping into just yet.</p>\n<p>Cable's Net Holds Fast</p>\n<p>And the networks are holding up well to current capacity strains wrought by homebound social distancing. Comcasts top technologist, president of technology and product <person>Tony Werner</person>, said the No. 1 cable companys networks are holding up just fine in locations like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wa.seatle\">Seattle</location>, which have seen traffic increases as high as 60% in peak weekend usage hours recently.</p>\n<p>Usage is on the rise as more people are working, learning and doing all their entertaining at home, Werner said on a <chron>March 30</chron> call with reporters. But its all within the capability of the network.</p>",
