    "text": "Vimal Patel spent three decades building a small family empire of hotels along\nLouisiana's highways and byways, but the coronavirus pandemic is threatening\nto tear the whole thing down.\n\nFrom behind his desk in the LaPlace headquarters of Q Hotel Management, his\nfamily-owned hotel development and management firm, Patel has been fighting to\nkeep the businesses running while scrambling through a thicket of government\nprograms. The 11 budget hotels he owns or operates in Louisiana and\nneighboring states have seen guest counts tumble and revenue plummet by nearly\n90% since the coronavirus virtually halted travel across the U.S.\n\nHe used to fill hotels with small conferences and meetings, oil industry\nworkers, families on road trips and other people passing through. Now, much of\nthat has disappeared.\n\n\"We're seeing occasional refinery workers and that can kind of guest, as well\nas some long-haul truck drivers,\" said Patel.\n\nHe's also under pressure from a specialized group of Wall Street lenders that\nindustry groups say haven't been forgiving in demanding payment from Patel and\nother borrowers, even as local banks and other lenders have granted many\nclients reprieve.\n\nPatel's plight is similar to that of many U.S. small businesses across the\ncountry as customers have all but disappeared because of state-mandated shut-\ndowns and general fears about the virus' spread. Hotels have been among the\nworst hit, with the American Hotel & Lodging Association forecasting that\noccupancy rates this year will be worse than 1933, the height of the Great\nDepression.\n\nHis hotel franchises - Wyndham Garden New Orleans Airport, Holiday Inn Express\nDonaldsonville, Candlewood Suites Houma, Best Western Plus Houma Inn, Holiday\nInn Express & Suites LaPlace, Best Western LaPlace Inn, Towneplace Suites\nLaPlace, Hampton Inn LaPlace, Staybridge Suites Lake Charles and Towneplace\nSuites Lubbock in Texas \\- were ticking along nicely at the end of last year,\nwith about $1.5 million in monthly revenue. He was also in the midst of\nbuilding another hotel, a Springhill by Marriott in Slidell.\n\nAfter the pandemic hit, the company's revenue dropped to $200,000 in April\nacross all of the hotels.\n\n\"We have built this up from scratch for more than two decades, literally\nbuilding each hotel from the ground up,\" said Patel. \"Now we're in danger of\nlosing everything we've worked so hard for.\"\n\nAn Indian national, Patel emigrated to Louisiana 30 years ago. His journey\nstarted in the tiny village of Nogama, in the state of Gujarat in western\nIndia. When he was 18, he traveled 3,600 miles from Nogama to Blantyre, the\ncommercial capital of Malawi in southeastern Africa. There he spent three\nyears working in his uncle's scented candle factory before embarking on an\n8,700-mile trek to join his cousin in Boutte running a 12-room motel.\n\n\"I started out living with my cousin, working in a doughnut shop and at fast-\nfood restaurants,\" said Patel during an interview at Q Hotel Management's\nLaPlace headquarters, a small but well-appointed office with modernist \"Q\"\nornaments adorning walls.\n\nHis business grew and he managed to survive the twin calamities of Hurricane\nKatrina and the BP oil spill.\n\nBut the coronavirus has hit hard. Like many of his business peers, he has\nturned to government programs for a lifeline but has been exasperated by the\nbureaucracy.\n\nPatel said he applied early for the Small Business Administration's Economic\nInjury Disaster Loans as well as Paycheck Protection Program relief, both of\nwhich were designed to provide quick help for small businesses so they could\nkeep staff on payroll and pay essential bills.\n\nHe said the PPP loans came in at about $40,000 per hotel, which together with\nthe 10%-to-15% occupancy they've been seeing has allowed him to temporarily\nbring back about 100 of the 300 workers that he had furloughed.\n\nMatt Langoehr was Patel's most recent general manager hire. He had come down\nfrom Milwaukee to start work in early March, traveling ahead of his wife who\nexpects to start medical school in New Orleans in the fall. He was furloughed\nalmost immediately, but when the call came to come back he jumped on it.\n\n\"As soon as they called me I was like, 'My car's packed, I'm on my way,'\" said\nLangoehr as he stood in the empty lobby of the LaPlace Hampton Inn.\n\nStill, the uncertainties persist for Patel and his ability to keep workers on.\nHe said that he's received loans of just $150,000 per hotel from the SBA after\nrequesting the initial maximum amount of $2 million, which was severely cut\nbecause of high demand nationally.\n\n\"That wouldn't even cover the mortgages for two months and would barely give\nus any breathing room,\" Patel said.\n\nAnother headache for Patel is rising franchise fees from the national hotel\nchains that have also mandated new cleaning regimes with specific vendors and\nchemicals, while offering no reduction in other costs, Patel said.\n\nFor Patel, matters have been made worse because two of his properties are\nfinanced by a type of borrowing that is often unforgiving in times of\nfinancial difficulty.\n\nQ Hotel Management has $19 million in outstanding loans that were packaged as\npart of commercial-mortgage backed securities, a complicated mechanism where\nlenders bundle mortgages together and then sell them to investors.\n\nAbout one-quarter of the hotels in the U.S. are financed by CMBS, while in\nLouisiana about four dozen hotels owe a total of $1.1 billion to CMBS lenders.\n\nOne of the conditions of Patel's loans is that he cannot borrow any additional\nmoney against the properties without seeking the permission of the firms in\ncharge, called \"servicers.\"\n\nThat has meant he has had to ask permission to apply for the SBA loans. One\nservicer, Prudential Asset Resources, didn't respond. He says that meant he\nmissed deadlines that cost him a chance for some emergency funds for his\nHoliday Inn Express in LaPlace.\n\nThe other, LMF Commercial, said it would let him apply for the government\nloans for the TownePlace Suites in LaPlace, but would charge thousands of\ndollars in fees just to talk about the terms of doing so.\n\n\"We are at their mercy,\" said Patel. \"They can keep racking up penalties and\nfees until you have no choice and have to walk away and leave the equity\nyou've built up over years. Once owners default they can cherry-pick what they\nwant to foreclose on, pick them up for pennies on the dollar.\"\n\nNeither Prudential or LMF responded to requests for comment.\n\nIssues with CMBS servicers have impacted many commercial properties\nnationally, such as shopping malls and office blocks, as well as hotels.\n\nWilliam \"Chip\" Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging\nAssociation, said they are lobbying for legislation that would offer both\nprotection for hoteliers from what his group argues are predatory lending\npractices, as well as separate legislation to provide a new round of SBA\nlending that would be targeted at those most in need.\n\n\"The problem with CMBS lending is it's so difficult to find a solution,\" said\nRogers. A poll of his members conducted in April found that 85% of those with\ntraditional lenders had been offered leniency from their banks, whereas only\n15% of CMBS borrowers had.\n\nPatel, who is a member of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association, said\nthe group recently met with Vice President Michael Pence in Florida to press\nthe case for federal legislation aimed at CMBS practices as well as extending\nmore SBA loans.\n\n\"If we could get measures to just stop the gouging and the exorbitant fees\nthat would at least be something,\" Patel said of the CMBS lenders.\n\nPatel, who is now 50, said he lives in a state of constant anxiety. The fear,\nhe said, is that he and his wife Mina, who runs the group's finances, as well\nas his cousins and business partners Vedant, Jay and Kevin, could see their\nAmerican dream evaporate.\n\n\"We have roots here, both my kids were born here, it's been a home for us,\"\nsaid Patel. \"Now, with all this COVID-19 and the financial scenarios, there's\na danger of me going back to working at McDonald's. But you have to do what\nyou have to do to survive.\"",

Now, much of that has disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're seeing occasional refinery workers and that can kind of guest, as well as some long-haul truck drivers,\" said Patel.</p>\n\n<p>He's also under pressure from a specialized group of <location>Wall Street</location> lenders that industry groups say haven't been forgiving in demanding payment from Patel and other borrowers, even as local banks and other lenders have granted many clients reprieve.</p>\n\n<p>Patel's plight is similar to that of many <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> small businesses across the country as customers have all but disappeared because of state-mandated shut-downs and general fears about the virus' spread. Hotels have been among the worst hit, with the <org>American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association</org> forecasting that occupancy rates this year will be worse than 1933, the height of the Great Depression.</p>\n\n<p>His hotel franchises - <location>Wyndham Garden New Orleans Airport</location>, <org>Holiday Inn Express Donaldsonville</org>, Candlewood Suites Houma, <location>Best Western Plus Houma Inn</location>, <org>Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites LaPlace</org>, <location>Best Western LaPlace Inn</location>, Towneplace Suites LaPlace, <org>Hampton Inn LaPlace</org>, Staybridge Suites <location>Lake Charles</location> and Towneplace Suites Lubbock in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> - were ticking along nicely at the end of last year, with about <money>$1.5 million</money> in monthly revenue. He was also in the midst of building another hotel, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.sprill\">Springhill</location> by Marriott in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.sliell\">Slidell</location>.</p>\n\n<p>After the pandemic hit, the company's revenue dropped to <money>$200,000</money> in April across all of the hotels.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have built this up from scratch for more than two decades, literally building each hotel from the ground up,\" said Patel. \"Now we're in danger of losing everything we've worked so hard for.\"</p>\n\n<p>An Indian national, Patel emigrated to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location> 30 years ago. His journey started in the tiny village of Nogama, in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.gj\">state of Gujarat</location> in western <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>. When he was 18, he traveled 3,600 miles from Nogama to Blantyre, the commercial capital of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mw\">Malawi</location> in southeastern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/afr\">Africa</location>. There he spent three years working in his uncle's scented candle factory before embarking on an 8,700-mile trek to join his cousin in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.boutte\">Boutte</location> running a 12-room motel.</p>\n\n<p>\"I started out living with my cousin, working in a doughnut shop and at fast-food restaurants,\" said Patel during an interview at <location>Q Hotel Management's</location> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.lapace\">LaPlace</location> headquarters, a small but well-appointed office with modernist \"Q\" ornaments adorning walls.</p>\n\n<p>His business grew and he managed to survive the twin calamities of Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill.</p>\n\n<p>But the coronavirus has hit hard. Like many of his business peers, he has turned to government programs for a lifeline but has been exasperated by the bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>Patel said he applied early for the <org>Small Business Administration's</org> Economic Injury Disaster Loans as well as Paycheck Protection Program relief, both of which were designed to provide quick help for small businesses so they could keep staff on payroll and pay essential bills.</p>\n\n<p>He said the PPP loans came in at about <money>$40,000</money> per hotel, which together with the 10%-to-15% occupancy they've been seeing has allowed him to temporarily bring back about 100 of the 300 workers that he had furloughed.</p>\n\n<p><person>Matt Langoehr</person> was Patel's most recent general manager hire. He had come down from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location> to start work in early March, traveling ahead of his wife who expects to start medical school in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> in the fall. He was furloughed almost immediately, but when the call came to come back he jumped on it.</p>\n\n<p>\"As soon as they called me I was like, 'My car's packed, I'm on my way,'\" said Langoehr as he stood in the empty lobby of the <location>LaPlace Hampton Inn</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the uncertainties persist for Patel and his ability to keep workers on. He said that he's received loans of just <money>$150,000</money> per hotel from the SBA after requesting the initial maximum amount of <money>$2 million</money>, which was severely cut because of high demand nationally.</p>\n\n<p>\"That wouldn't even cover the mortgages for two months and would barely give us any breathing room,\" Patel said.</p>\n\n<p>Another headache for Patel is rising franchise fees from the national hotel chains that have also mandated new cleaning regimes with specific vendors and chemicals, while offering no reduction in other costs, Patel said.</p>\n\n<p>For Patel, matters have been made worse because two of his properties are financed by a type of borrowing that is often unforgiving in times of financial difficulty.</p>\n\n<p><location>Q Hotel Management</location> has <money>$19 million</money> in outstanding loans that were packaged as part of commercial-mortgage backed securities, a complicated mechanism where lenders bundle mortgages together and then sell them to investors.</p>\n\n<p>About one-quarter of the hotels in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> are financed by CMBS, while in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location> about four dozen hotels owe a total of <money>$1.1 billion</money> to CMBS lenders.</p>\n\n<p>One of the conditions of Patel's loans is that he cannot borrow any additional money against the properties without seeking the permission of the firms in charge, called \"servicers.\"</p>\n\n<p>That has meant he has had to ask permission to apply for the SBA loans. One servicer, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4290479481\">Prudential Asset Resources</org>, didn't respond. He says that meant he missed deadlines that cost him a chance for some emergency funds for his <org>Holiday Inn Express</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.lapace\">LaPlace</location>.</p>\n\n<p>The other, LMF Commercial, said it would let him apply for the government loans for the TownePlace Suites in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.lapace\">LaPlace</location>, but would charge thousands of dollars in fees just to talk about the terms of doing so.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are at their mercy,\" said Patel. \"They can keep racking up penalties and fees until you have no choice and have to walk away and leave the equity you've built up over years. Once owners default they can cherry-pick what they want to foreclose on, pick them up for pennies on the dollar.\"</p>\n\n<p>Neither Prudential or LMF responded to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Issues with CMBS servicers have impacted many commercial properties nationally, such as shopping malls and office blocks, as well as hotels.</p>\n\n<p><person>William \"Chip\" Rogers</person>, president and CEO of the <location>American Hotel</location> and <org>Lodging Association</org>, said they are lobbying for legislation that would offer both protection for hoteliers from what his group argues are predatory lending practices, as well as separate legislation to provide a new round of SBA lending that would be targeted at those most in need.</p>\n\n<p>\"The problem with CMBS lending is it's so difficult to find a solution,\" said Rogers. A poll of his members conducted in April found that 85% of those with traditional lenders had been offered leniency from their banks, whereas only 15% of CMBS borrowers had.</p>\n\n<p>Patel, who is a member of the <org>Asian American Hotel Owners Association</org>, said the group recently met with Vice President <person>Michael Pence</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> to press the case for federal legislation aimed at CMBS practices as well as extending more SBA loans.</p>\n\n<p>\"If we could get measures to just stop the gouging and the exorbitant fees that would at least be something,\" Patel said of the CMBS lenders.</p>\n\n<p>Patel, who is now 50, said he lives in a state of constant anxiety. The fear, he said, is that he and his wife Mina, who runs the group's finances, as well as his cousins and business partners Vedant, Jay and Kevin, could see their American dream evaporate.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have roots here, both my kids were born here, it's been a home for us,\" said Patel. \"Now, with all this COVID-19 and the financial scenarios, there's a danger of me going back to working at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:MCD\">McDonald's</org>. But you have to do what you have to do to survive.\"</p>",
