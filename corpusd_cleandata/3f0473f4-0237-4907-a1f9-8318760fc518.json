    "text": "IF you are on a bicycle, it is important to remember that you are still bound\nby the general road rules as well as additional road rules specific to\ncyclists.\n\nCyclists can be issued traffic fines for riding through a red light, not\nwearing a helmet, or riding the wrong way along the street are among the most\ncommon traffic offences.\n\nAlways use your common sense, obey the road rules, and remember to regularly\ncheck your surroundings and the vehicles around you.\n\nSome of the penalties related specifically to cyclist include: \u2022 carrying more\npassengers than a bicycle is designed for; \u2022 failing to give way to\npedestrians on a footpath or shared path; and, \u2022 failing to display a light at\nnight or in hazardous weather conditions. Cyclists who break these road rules\nwill be given the same fines as motorists: \u2022 failing to stop at a red traffic\nlight; \u2022 disobeying a 'no U-turn' sign at an intersection; \u2022 failing to stop\nat a 'stop' sign at an intersection; and, \u2022 exceeding the speed limit in a\nspeed zone by less than 13km/h. As a motorist, it is important to remember\nthat bicycles are much smaller than cars and trucks, so they are harder to\nsee. Check your blind spots before changing lanes, turning, or when you open\nyour car door.\n\nIf it is safe, indicate and pass the cyclist at the minimum distance. If it is\nnot safe, slow down and wait until it is safe for you to pass. This should not\nhold you up for long and it could save the life of a cyclist.\n\nYou are allowed to cross centre lines, including double unbroken centre lines,\nto pass a cyclist as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe to pass a\ncyclist, you must wait until it is safe to pass.\n\nIt is legal for two cyclists to ride side-by-side on a road, as long as they\nare not more than 1.5m apart.\n\nIf a cyclist is ahead of you and you want to turn left, turn behind the\ncyclist. Overtaking and cutting off the cyclist is very dangerous.

    "title": "DO ROAD RULES APPLY TO CYCLISTS?",
    "html": "<p>IF you are on a bicycle, it is important to remember that you are still bound by the general road rules as well as additional road rules specific to cyclists.</p>\n\n<p>Cyclists can be issued traffic fines for riding through a red light, not wearing a helmet, or riding the wrong way along the street are among the most common traffic offences.</p>\n\n<p>Always use your common sense, obey the road rules, and remember to regularly check your surroundings and the vehicles around you.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the penalties related specifically to cyclist include:   &#8226; carrying more passengers than a bicycle is designed for;   &#8226; failing to give way to pedestrians on a footpath or shared path; and,   &#8226; failing to display a light at night or in hazardous weather conditions.   Cyclists who break these road rules will be given the same fines as motorists:   &#8226; failing to stop at a red traffic light;   &#8226; disobeying a &#8216;no U-turn&#8217; sign at an intersection;   &#8226; failing to stop at a &#8216;stop&#8217; sign at an intersection; and,   &#8226; exceeding the speed limit in a speed zone by less than 13km/h.   As a motorist, it is important to remember that bicycles are much smaller than cars and trucks, so they are harder to see. Check your blind spots before changing lanes, turning, or when you open your car door.</p>\n\n<p>If it is safe, indicate and pass the cyclist at the minimum distance.   If it is not safe, slow down and wait until it is safe for you to pass. This should not hold you up for long and it could save the life of a cyclist.</p>\n\n<p>You are allowed to cross centre lines, including double unbroken centre lines, to pass a cyclist as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe to pass a cyclist, you must wait until it is safe to pass.</p>\n\n<p>It is legal for two cyclists to ride side-by-side on a road, as long as they are not more than 1.5m apart.</p>\n\n<p>If a cyclist is ahead of you and you want to turn left, turn behind the cyclist. Overtaking and cutting off the cyclist is very dangerous.
