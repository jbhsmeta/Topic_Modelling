    "text": "One seal has died and another is fighting for her life after becoming trapped\nin fishing nets off the Norfolk coast.\n\nFriends of Horsey Seals rescued two seals from\n\nHorsey beach, which were seen with blue plastic netting tangled tightly around\ntheir necks.\n\nJuvenile grey seal Galactica was rescued on Sunday, May 24, and is now with\nthe RSPCA, which is battling to save her life at the East Winch Wildlife\nCentre in King's Lynn.\n\nManager Alison Charles said: \"We admitted an adult seal who had fishing\nnetting tangled tightly around his neck and head. His head was swollen and we\nlater discovered it was full of pus.\n\n\"As we desperately tried to untangle the netting from him he died. It was\nheartbreaking to see this big, beautiful creature die as we battled to save\nhim.\n\n\"Then, Galactica arrived just a few days later with the same injuries caused\nby the same culprit: fishing netting. Enough is enough.\"\n\nGalactica is the third seal to be admitted this year and the 56th taken in by\nthe Norfolk centre since 2008, with Ms Charles stressing that the issue \"isn't\ngoing away\".\n\nIn fact, last year was the worse on record, with 11 seals arriving at the\ncentre with similar injuries.\n\nShe said: \"Plastic and fishing litter are a silent killer for these beautiful\nanimals. Seals are inquisitive creatures who can easily become tangled or\ntrapped as they search for food.\n\n\"Netting quickly weighs them down, makes it hard for them to swim and embeds\ninto their flesh causing horrendous injuries and infection.\"\n\nEarlier in May volunteers removed 420m sq of netting from Waxham Beach after\nthree large nets washed up on the shoreline.\n\nIn Galactica's case, a vet removed the netting which cut deeply into her\nflesh. She is now on painkillers, antibiotics and a routine of daily salt\nbaths to help the wound heal.\n\nBut this process is expensive.\n\nGalactica will require at least four 25kg bags of salt daily, with each bag\ncosting more than \u00a314.\n\nYou can visit the centre's Amazon Wishlist to donate salt bags and help the\nRSPCA protect wildlife by calling them on 0300 1234 999 if you see an animal\nin distress.",

His head was swollen and we later discovered it was full of pus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we desperately tried to untangle the netting from him he died. It was heartbreaking to see this big, beautiful creature die as we battled to save him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then, Galactica arrived just a few days later with the same injuries caused by the same culprit: fishing netting. Enough is enough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Galactica is the third seal to be admitted this year and the 56th taken in by the Norfolk centre since 2008, with <person>Ms Charles</person> stressing that the issue &#8220;isn&#8217;t going away&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In fact, last year was the worse on record, with 11 seals arriving at the centre with similar injuries.</p>\n<p>She said: &#8220;Plastic and fishing litter are a silent killer for these beautiful animals. Seals are inquisitive creatures who can easily become tangled or trapped as they search for food. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Netting quickly weighs them down, makes it hard for them to swim and embeds into their flesh causing horrendous injuries and infection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier in May volunteers removed 420m sq of netting from Waxham Beach after three large nets washed up on the shoreline. </p>\n<p>In Galactica&#8217;s case, a vet removed the netting which cut deeply into her flesh. She is now on painkillers, antibiotics and a routine of daily salt baths to help the wound heal.</p>\n<p>But this process is expensive.</p>\n<p>Galactica will require at least four 25kg bags of salt daily, with each bag costing more than &#163;14.</p>\n<p>You can visit the centre&#8217;s Amazon Wishlist to donate salt bags and help the RSPCA protect wildlife by calling them on 0300 1234 999 if you see an animal in distress.</p>",
