    "text": "A person standing in the right street-level spot on the 1700 block of East\nState Street can peer up through a second-floor bedroom window, through an\nopen roof then see clouds or blue sky.\n\nIt's been that way for five years, ever since a roofer's blow torch started a\nsix-alarm blaze that made 20 row-homes uninhabitable since June 8, 2015, in\nthis Bromley section of Hamilton Twp.\n\nOn this morning, several days prior to the five-year anniversary, a large gray\ncat with white paws stepped out of a second-floor window of house number 1748,\ntiptoed across the roof then slipped into an open window next door.\n\nMiss Kitty acted like she owned the place and could make that claim if\nHamilton Twp. allowed squatters' rights. Neighbors say cats have overrun the\nhouses, moved in months after the fire.\n\n\"There's a woman who stops by and feeds them regularly. Along with the cats we\nhave raccoons, mice, and other rodents,\" Brenda Whitaker, housing resource\ndirector at HomeFront, said.\n\nHomeFront missions to end homelessness in Central New Jersey with myriad\nprograms supported by resources and expertise gleaned from community members.\n\nWhitaker lived on nearby Nottingham on the day of the blaze that needed skills\nof 175 firefighters from local stations, plus, others from Burlington and\nHunterdon counties.\n\nUnder control after four hours, fire or smoke damage displaced 44 residents.\nWhitaker, who moved onto East State St. in 2017, never expected current\nconditions.\n\n\"I remember coming home that day and seeing (then) Hamilton Mayor (Kelly)\nYaede here. A lot of things were talked about but nothing's happened.\"\n\n\"These abandoned buildings just make the entire neighborhood appear\ndilapidated. Hamilton workers do come around. They sweep. But that's it.\nResidents have heard forever that they were going to tear these houses\ndown......nothing.\"\n\nIt's been politicians pussyfooting about the future of this stretch of houses\nin one of the township's most challenged neighborhoods that have kept\nresidents off-stride, particularly on a closed sidewalk that requires\npedestrians to sidestep a chain-link fence that keeps people out of the\ncondemned structures.\n\nThat barrier captures any wind-blown trash which presses against the fence and\nproduces an unsightly accumulation of litter that adds to the depressive look\non this stretch of East State St.\n\nWhitaker said the trash is not indicative of the homeowners. \"Most of us sweep\nin front of our homes but we can do only so much,\" she added.\n\nA nearby lot includes a large blue collection box for donations of shoes and\nclothing. An overflow of black plastic garbage bags have been discarded near\nthe receptacle. Tall weeds surround the container, another sign of disregard\nfor a community living on the edge.\n\nJoseph Melvin has looked frequently from his across-the-street vantage point\nin the front room of his home shared with wife, Esther, or other perches.\n\nLast Sunday, Melvin, dressed in dark blue shorts and a red tank top that\nacknowledged July 26, the Liberian Independence Day celebration, seated\nhimself in a folding chair on the side of his home. His feet were removed from\nflip flops as he watched evening arrive.\n\nMelvin, retired and a proud resident of the Bromley for years, expressed\ndismay and discussed many issues about the row of houses falling apart.\n\n\"Five years ago, 2015, we stood right there and watched that fire.\n\nCan't believe that much time has passed. I haven't heard from anyone, from the\nlast mayor or the new one. Have no idea about what they're planning.\"\n\n\"And man, when I tell you about the cats over there. You oughta see those\ncats.\"",

    "html": "<p>A person standing in the right street-level spot on the 1700 block of <location>East State Street</location> can peer up through a second-floor bedroom window, through an open roof then see clouds or blue sky.</p>\n<p>It's been that way for five years, ever since a roofer's blow torch started a six-alarm blaze that made 20 row-homes uninhabitable since <chron>June 8, 2015</chron>, in this Bromley section of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.hamtwp\">Hamilton Twp</location>.</p>\n\n<p>On this morning, several days prior to the five-year anniversary, a large gray cat with white paws stepped out of a second-floor window of house number 1748, tiptoed across the roof then slipped into an open window next door.</p>\n\n<p>Miss Kitty acted like she owned the place and could make that claim if <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.hamtwp\">Hamilton Twp</location>. allowed squatters' rights. Neighbors say cats have overrun the houses, moved in months after the fire.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's a woman who stops by and feeds them regularly. Along with the cats we have raccoons, mice, and other rodents,\" <person>Brenda Whitaker</person>, housing resource director at HomeFront, said.</p>\n\n<p>HomeFront missions to end homelessness in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">Central New Jersey</location> with myriad programs supported by resources and expertise gleaned from community members.</p>\n\n<p>Whitaker lived on nearby Nottingham on the day of the blaze that needed skills of 175 firefighters from local stations, plus, others from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.burltn\">Burlington</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.hundon\">Hunterdon</location> counties.</p>\n\n<p>Under control after four hours, fire or smoke damage displaced 44 residents. Whitaker, who moved onto <location>East State St.</location> in 2017, never expected current conditions.</p>\n\n<p>\"I remember coming home that day and seeing (then) <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.halton\">Hamilton</location> Mayor (Kelly) <person>Yaede</person> here. A lot of things were talked about but nothing's happened.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"These abandoned buildings just make the entire neighborhood appear dilapidated. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.halton\">Hamilton</location> workers do come around. They sweep. But that's it. Residents have heard forever that they were going to tear these houses down......nothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's been politicians pussyfooting about the future of this stretch of houses in one of the township's most challenged neighborhoods that have kept residents off-stride, particularly on a closed sidewalk that requires pedestrians to sidestep a chain-link fence that keeps people out of the condemned structures.</p>\n\n<p>That barrier captures any wind-blown trash which presses against the fence and produces an unsightly accumulation of litter that adds to the depressive look on this stretch of <location>East State St.</location></p>\n\n<p>Whitaker said the trash is not indicative of the homeowners. \"Most of us sweep in front of our homes but we can do only so much,\" she added.</p>\n\n<p>A nearby lot includes a large blue collection box for donations of shoes and clothing. An overflow of black plastic garbage bags have been discarded near the receptacle. Tall weeds surround the container, another sign of disregard for a community living on the edge.</p>\n\n<p><person>Joseph Melvin</person> has looked frequently from his across-the-street vantage point in the front room of his home shared with wife, Esther, or other perches.</p>\n\n<p>Last Sunday, Melvin, dressed in dark blue shorts and a red tank top that acknowledged <chron>July 26</chron>, the Liberian <chron>Independence Day</chron> celebration, seated himself in a folding chair on the side of his home. His feet were removed from flip flops as he watched evening arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Melvin, retired and a proud resident of the Bromley for years, expressed dismay and discussed many issues about the row of houses falling apart.</p>\n\n<p>\"Five years ago, 2015, we stood right there and watched that fire.</p>\n\n<p>Can't believe that much time has passed. I haven't heard from anyone, from the last mayor or the new one. Have no idea about what they're planning.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"And man, when I tell you about the cats over there. You oughta see those cats.\"</p>",
