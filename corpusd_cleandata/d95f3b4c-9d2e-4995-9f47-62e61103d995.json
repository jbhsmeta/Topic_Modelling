    "text": "Bluprint, a subscription online service focused on crafts and entertainment,\nis permanently closing and laying off 137 employees.\n\nAnother business, Group Publishing Inc. in Loveland, will lay off 62\nemployees, or 45% of its workforce.\n\nDenver-based Bluprint, formerly named Craftsy Unlimited, was bought by\nNBCUniversal Cable Entertainment in 2018 and promoted as a digital service\noffering crafts classes and original content. In a letter on the website, CEO\nJohn Levisay said Bluprint will close operations over the next few months.\n\nThe company is looking at allowing people who bought individual classes to\nreceive copies and issuing prorated refunds to subscribers, Levisay said. In a\nnotice to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, Bluprint said\nlayoffs will begin around July 22 and continue until the offices are closed,\nexpected at the end of August.\n\nCraftsy, which started in 2011,was seen as a leader among Denver's tech\nstartups. It featured online classes in cooking, quilting and knitting as well\nas entertainment series.\n\nGroup Publishing Inc., based in Loveland, has notified state officials know\nthat it is letting 62 of its employees go. The layoffs will be permanent, the\ncompany said. Seventy-six employees will remain.\n\nThe company produces publications for churches across the county. The main\nmaterials are for vacation Bible schools.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic \"and related government actions\" led to a serious\ndownturn in business, the company said in a letter to the state labor\ndepartment.\n\n\"Though some states are allowing big box stores and other establishments to\nopen, they've been slower to accommodate church activities,\" Thom Schultz, the\ncompany's founder and president said in a statement.\n\nAs a result, thousands of churches have canceled their summer programs for\nchildren, Schultz said. Group Publishing is providing a free guide to adapt\nits curriculum for at-home use, he said.\n\n\"This is the most difficult time in our history,\" Schultz said. \"It is\nexcruciating. We will be saying good-bye to great, great people, many of whom\nhave been with us for decades.\"\n\nLayoffs will start July 1.\n\nThis story was updated to correct that Group Publishing Inc. is not closing\nbut is laying off 62 people and to add comment from the company.",

In a letter on the website, CEO <person>John Levisay</person> said Bluprint will close operations over the next few months.</p>\n\n<p>The company is looking at allowing people who bought individual classes to receive copies and issuing prorated refunds to subscribers, Levisay said. In a notice to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1040575734\">Colorado Department of Labor and Employment</org>, Bluprint said layoffs will begin around <chron>July 22</chron> and continue until the offices are closed, expected at the end of August.</p>\n\n<p>Craftsy, which started in 2011,was seen as a leader among <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver's</location> tech startups.
