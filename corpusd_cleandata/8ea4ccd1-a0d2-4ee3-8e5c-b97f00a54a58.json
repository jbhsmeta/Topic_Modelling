    "text": "DES MOINES \\- One day after Iowa matched one of the lowest single-day new\ncoronavirus-related deaths since the early days of the pandemic here, the\nstate on Tuesday matched the second-highest single-day total with 21 virus-\nrelated deaths.\n\nThe 21 new deaths recorded Tuesday were more than the previous three days\ncombined, at least temporarily halted what had been a downward trend in new\ndaily deaths, and displayed volatility in the data.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the state also surpassed 20,000 total confirmed cases\nsince the virus was first officially detected here in mid-March, according to\nstate public health data.\n\nCerro Gordo County cases remains the same as it was on Monday at 29.\n\nThe state surpassed 5,000 tests processed in a single day, Iowa Gov. Kim\nReynolds said Tuesday during a press conference at the Iowa State Capitol.\nReynolds said on Saturday the state hygienic lab processed 5,223 tests,\nfinally hitting the goal that was established when the state entered into a\n$26 million contract with a Utah-based private health care company to boost\ntesting.\n\nReynolds said the state surpassed 5,000 tests again on Monday.\n\nReynolds also said 1 in 19 Iowans has now been tested at least once, and that\nstate public health data shows the rate of positive cases decreasing.\n\n\"I'm proud of what we've accomplished,\" Reynolds said. \"But the pandemic is\nnot over and there remains much work to do.\"\n\nThe previous three days brought a total of 19 virus-related deaths in Iowa,\nincluding just four confirmed on Monday. That brought the seven-day average to\nits lowest point in nearly two weeks.\n\nBut that average increased with Tuesday's 21 deaths, the Iowa's second-highest\nsingle-day total behind only the 26 confirmed on May 23.\n\nVirus-related hospitalizations, on the other hand, continued downward trends\nthat are approaching a month long.\n\nThe 327 hospitalizations recorded Tuesday are the fewest since late April, and\nthe seven-day average of 360 is the lowest since early May and continues a\ndownward trajectory that started with a peak on May 11.\n\nThe 12 new virus-related hospital admissions recorded Tuesday is the fewest\nsince mid-April, and the seven-day average of 26.9 is the lowest since late\nApril.\n\nGUARD READY IF NEEDED\n\nReynolds said she has not yet activated the Iowa National Guard to assist\nlocal law enforcement departments at protests taking place across the state,\nbut that the guard stands ready if called upon.\n\nTwo people were killed and a police officer and another person were injured in\nprotests in Davenport over the weekend, and law enforcement has on multiple\noccasions used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse protests\nin Des Moines over the past week.\n\n\"(The Guard) is a resource I can call up if needed,\" Reynolds said Tuesday.\n\"At this point we have not needed that, but they are ready at a moment's\nnotice.\"\n\nProtesters are calling attention to George Floyd, a Minnesota black man who\ndied after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly 9 minutes.",
