    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily Asia\nBusiness -- Samsung Display Co. Ltd. (Yongin, Gyeonggi-Do, South Korea) has\nbeen issued patent number 10,665,651, according to news reporting originating\nout of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Kim, Min-Sung (Hwaseong-si, South Korea); Nguyen,\nThanh Tien (Seoul, South Korea); Im, Ki Ju (Suwon-si, South Korea).\n\nThis patent was filed on June 30, 2015 and was published online on June 8,\n2020.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents\nobtained the following quote: \"One or more embodiments herein relate to an\norganic light emitting diode display.\n\n\"An organic light emitting diode display generates images using a plurality of\npixels. Each pixel includes an organic emission layer positioned between two\nelectrodes. The pixel emits light when electrons from a cathode and holes from\nan anode recombine in the organic emission layer to form excitons which then\nchange state.\n\n\"Various types of organic light emitting diode displays have been developed.\nExamples includes flexible displays, curved displays, foldable displays,\nrollable displays, and stretchable displays. When the display is curved,\nfolded, or rolled, stress is generated by an inorganic layer. e.g., barrier\nlayer, buffer layer, gate insulating layer, or an interlayer insulating layer.\nIn order to distribute the stress, a groove may be formed by etching part of\nthe inorganic layer between pixels. The etching separates the pixels to create\nan island-type structure.\n\n\"However, the thickness of the inorganic layer between a gate electrode and a\ndata line or a driving voltage line is decreased when over-etching occurs. In\nthis case, the inorganic layer may serve as a current leakage pass.\n\n\"Further, the tapered angle of a data metal layer in the groove may increase\nas a result of the etching, and thus the thickness of the data metal layer in\nthe groove may partially increase. Accordingly, when the data line or the\ndriving voltage line is formed by etching the data metal layer by a\nphotolithography process substantially in the vertical direction at the\ngroove, at least a portion of the data metal layer may not be etched. The\nunetched portion of the data metal layer may disconnect the data line and the\ndriving voltage line from each other to create the current leakage pass.\n\n\"Further, when the groove is formed by etching the inorganic layer, the entire\npath of the data line or the driving voltage line passing through the groove\nincreases. Consequently, the resistance of the data line or the driving\nvoltage line increases and thus it is difficult to stably supply current to\nthe pixel.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also\nobtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"In accordance\nwith one or more embodiments, an organic light emitting diode display includes\na substrate; a plurality of first signal lines on the substrate and extending\nin a first direction, a first insulating layer covering the substrate and the\nfirst signal lines; a plurality of second signal lines on the first insulating\nlayer and crossing the first signal line; a plurality of pixels connected to\nthe first signal lines and the second signal lines; and a groove in the first\ninsulating layer to separate adjacent ones of the pixels; and a filling\nmaterial in the groove.\n\n\"The groove may extend in a same direction as the first signal lines. The\nsecond signal line may pass across a top of the filling material. The first\nsignal lines may include a scan line to transfer a scan signal, the second\nsignal lines may include a data line to transfer a data signal and a driving\nvoltage line to transfer a driving voltage, and the data line and driving\nvoltage line may pass across the top of the filling material.\n\n\"The first insulating layer may include a gate insulating layer covering the\nscan line and an interlayer insulating layer covering the gate insulating\nlayer, and the separation groove passes through the gate insulating layer and\nthe interlayer insulating layer. The first insulating layer may include an\ninorganic material, and the filling material may include an elastic material.\nA Young's modulus of the filling material may be smaller than a Young's\nmodulus of the first insulating layer. The elastic material may include an\norganic material or a viscoelastic material.\n\n\"The display may include a barrier film and a buffer layer between the\nsubstrate and the first insulating layer, wherein the groove extends up to the\nbarrier film and the buffer layer. Each of the barrier film and buffer layer\nmay include an inorganic material, and a Young's modulus of the filling\nmaterial may be smaller than a Young's modulus of the barrier film and the\nbuffer layer. An upper surface of the first insulating layer and an upper\nsurface of the filling material maybe at substantially a same level.\n\n\"Each of the pixels may include a light emitting diode and a plurality of\ntransistors connected to the scan line, the data line, and the driving voltage\nline. The substrate may have a folding area and some of the pixels, the\ngroove, and the filling material may correspond the folding area.\n\n\"In accordance with one or more other embodiments, a display includes a layer;\na groove in the layer; and a filling material in the groove, wherein the\ngroove separates a first pixel from a second pixel to distribute stress during\nbending of a surface of the display. The first and second pixels may have an\nisland-type structure based on the groove. The layer may includes an\ninsulating material. The filling material may include an elastic material. A\nYoung's modulus of the filling material may be smaller than a Young's modulus\nof the layer. A data line may extend passing across the filing material along\na substantially coplanar path.

Ltd.</org> (Yongin, Gyeonggi-Do, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location>) has been issued patent number 10,665,651, according to news reporting originating out of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.alxdra\">Alexandria, Virginia</location>, by NewsRx editors.</p>\n<p>The patent&#8217;s inventors are Kim, Min-Sung (Hwaseong-si, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location>); Nguyen, <person>Thanh Tien</person> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/kr..seoul\">Seoul, South Korea</location>); Im, <person>Ki Ju</person> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/kr..suwon\">Suwon</location>-si, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location>).</p>\n<p>This patent was filed on <chron>June 30, 2015</chron> and was published online on <chron>June 8, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: &#8220;One or more embodiments herein relate to an organic light emitting diode display.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An organic light emitting diode display generates images using a plurality of pixels. Each pixel includes an organic emission layer positioned between two electrodes. The pixel emits light when electrons from a cathode and holes from an anode recombine in the organic emission layer to form excitons which then change state.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Various types of organic light emitting diode displays have been developed. Examples includes flexible displays, curved displays, foldable displays, rollable displays, and stretchable displays. When the display is curved, folded, or rolled, stress is generated by an inorganic layer. e.g., barrier layer, buffer layer, gate insulating layer, or an interlayer insulating layer. In order to distribute the stress, a groove may be formed by etching part of the inorganic layer between pixels. The etching separates the pixels to create an island-type structure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, the thickness of the inorganic layer between a gate electrode and a data line or a driving voltage line is decreased when over-etching occurs. In this case, the inorganic layer may serve as a current leakage pass.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Further, the tapered angle of a data metal layer in the groove may increase as a result of the etching, and thus the thickness of the data metal layer in the groove may partially increase. Accordingly, when the data line or the driving voltage line is formed by etching the data metal layer by a photolithography process substantially in the vertical direction at the groove, at least a portion of the data metal layer may not be etched. The unetched portion of the data metal layer may disconnect the data line and the driving voltage line from each other to create the current leakage pass.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Further, when the groove is formed by etching the inorganic layer, the entire path of the data line or the driving voltage line passing through the groove increases. Consequently, the resistance of the data line or the driving voltage line increases and thus it is difficult to stably supply current to the pixel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;In accordance with one or more embodiments, an organic light emitting diode display includes a substrate; a plurality of first signal lines on the substrate and extending in a first direction, a first insulating layer covering the substrate and the first signal lines; a plurality of second signal lines on the first insulating layer and crossing the first signal line; a plurality of pixels connected to the first signal lines and the second signal lines; and a groove in the first insulating layer to separate adjacent ones of the pixels; and a filling material in the groove.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The groove may extend in a same direction as the first signal lines. The second signal line may pass across a top of the filling material. The first signal lines may include a scan line to transfer a scan signal, the second signal lines may include a data line to transfer a data signal and a driving voltage line to transfer a driving voltage, and the data line and driving voltage line may pass across the top of the filling material.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first insulating layer may include a gate insulating layer covering the scan line and an interlayer insulating layer covering the gate insulating layer, and the separation groove passes through the gate insulating layer and the interlayer insulating layer. The first insulating layer may include an inorganic material, and the filling material may include an elastic material. A Young&#8217;s modulus of the filling material may be smaller than a Young&#8217;s modulus of the first insulating layer. The elastic material may include an organic material or a viscoelastic material.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The display may include a barrier film and a buffer layer between the substrate and the first insulating layer, wherein the groove extends up to the barrier film and the buffer layer. Each of the barrier film and buffer layer may include an inorganic material, and a Young&#8217;s modulus of the filling material may be smaller than a Young&#8217;s modulus of the barrier film and the buffer layer. An upper surface of the first insulating layer and an upper surface of the filling material maybe at substantially a same level.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Each of the pixels may include a light emitting diode and a plurality of transistors connected to the scan line, the data line, and the driving voltage line. The substrate may have a folding area and some of the pixels, the groove, and the filling material may correspond the folding area.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In accordance with one or more other embodiments, a display includes a layer; a groove in the layer; and a filling material in the groove, wherein the groove separates a first pixel from a second pixel to distribute stress during bending of a surface of the display. The first and second pixels may have an island-type structure based on the groove. The layer may includes an insulating material. The filling material may include an elastic material. A Young&#8217;s modulus of the filling material may be smaller than a Young&#8217;s modulus of the layer. A data line may extend passing across the filing material along a substantially coplanar path. A driving voltage line may extend across the filling material along a substantially coplanar path.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is claimed is:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
