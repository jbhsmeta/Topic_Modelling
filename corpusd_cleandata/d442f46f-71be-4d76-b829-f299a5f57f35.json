    "text": "Declaring that it was her mountain, a Tellico Plains woman allegedly announced\nshe was going to kill everybody and bury them on it May 29.\n\nMonroe County Sheriff's Deputy Dalton Rinehart said he spoke with a man around\n9 p.m. that day and was told that earlier, around 2 p.m., the man and several\nother people were eating at William's Mountain Market and, as they were\nleaving, Christy Lance, the man's ex-wife, pulled into the gas station area,\neven though he has a restraining order against her and his work truck would\nhave let her know he was there.\n\nThe man told Rinehart his ex-wife and her boyfriend got out of the car and she\napproached him while her boyfriend went into the store. The man said his ex-\nwife demanded to know why he put her in jail, said she was going to bury them\nall in the mountains and was cursing him.\n\nRinehart said he talked to the owner of the store and was told security\ncameras weren't working, but he said he was there at the time and did witness\nLance causing a scene.\n\nRinehart said he talked to other witnesses who told him they had seen Lance\ncome to the store and was yelling at everyone and that she got her dog out of\nthe back of her truck and cursed her ex-husband in front of everyone. One\nwitness said Lance did state the mountain belonged to her and she was going to\nbury everyone on it.\n\nThe man told Rinehart he was scared his ex-wife would try to harm him and that\nhe wanted her arrested for violating the order of protection. Rinehart said he\nchecked and found Lance had been arrested on May 21 for violating the order by\nshowing up at her ex-husband's house.\n\nRinehart issued an order for Lance's arrest. Lance, 36, Tellico Plains, will\nbe charged with domestic violence, violating an order of protection and\nstalking.",
