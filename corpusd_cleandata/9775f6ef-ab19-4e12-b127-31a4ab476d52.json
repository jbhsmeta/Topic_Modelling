    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Internet Daily\nNews \\-- Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (Stockholm, Sweden) has been\nissued patent number 10,666,755, according to news reporting originating out\nof Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx editors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Zhu, Zhongwen (Saint-Laurent, CA); Pourzandi, Makan\n(Montreal, CA).\n\nThis patent was filed on October 23, 2015 and was published online on June 8,\n2020.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents\nobtained the following quote: \"In current content delivery networks, Hypertext\nTransfer Protocol (HTTP) is used as a main delivery mechanism. Since the\nasset, or data such as a title or content, is delivered in a non-secure\nenvironment, this allows the delivery node to verify the asset. Then, the\ndelivery node can decide to cache the asset based upon the content\nverification. In this way, the delivery node can serve the same asset to\ndifferent subscribers. This leads to a significant reduction in the round trip\nfrom the client to server, which improves the user experience.\n\n\"The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)/Internet Engineering Task\nForce (IETF) has recently released HTTP 2, within which, Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS) is mandatory for HTTP traffic. This means that in the future,\ncontent will be delivered via an end-to-end secure connection. Major browsers\nare being developed to support the new standard.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also\nobtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"According to\nsome embodiments, a method of operation implemented by a communication device\nof a subscriber configured for operation in a communication network includes\nsending a content request to a CP system reachable via the communication\nnetwork, the content request identifying targeted content, such as a video,\nand including a public key of the communication device. The method includes\nreceiving a response from the CP system that identifies a CDN and includes an\nauthorization token and a content key that is derived from the public key of\nthe communication device and a private key of the CP system. The method also\nincludes sending the authorization token to the CDN and correspondingly\nreceiving a delivery token and an address of a DN. The method then includes\nsending the delivery token and the content key to the DN and correspondingly\nreceiving encrypted content from the DN, the encrypted content comprising at\nleast a portion of the targeted content as initially encrypted by the CP using\na public key of the CP, and as further encrypted by the CDN using the content\nkey provided by the communication device.

Since the asset, or data such as a title or content, is delivered in a non-secure environment, this allows the delivery node to verify the asset. Then, the delivery node can decide to cache the asset based upon the content verification. In this way, the delivery node can serve the same asset to different subscribers. This leads to a significant reduction in the round trip from the client to server, which improves the user experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)/<org>Internet Engineering Task Force</org> (IETF) has recently released HTTP 2, within which, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is mandatory for HTTP traffic. This means that in the future, content will be delivered via an end-to-end secure connection. Major browsers are being developed to support the new standard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;According to some embodiments, a method of operation implemented by a communication device of a subscriber configured for operation in a communication network includes sending a content request to a CP system reachable via the communication network, the content request identifying targeted content, such as a video, and including a public key of the communication device. The method includes receiving a response from the CP system that identifies a CDN and includes an authorization token and a content key that is derived from the public key of the communication device and a private key of the CP system. The method also includes sending the authorization token to the CDN and correspondingly receiving a delivery token and an address of a DN. The method then includes sending the delivery token and the content key to the DN and correspondingly receiving encrypted content from the DN, the encrypted content comprising at least a portion of the targeted content as initially encrypted by the CP using a public key of the CP, and as further encrypted by the CDN using the content key provided by the communication device.
