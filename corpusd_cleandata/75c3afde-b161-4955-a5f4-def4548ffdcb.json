    "text": "Throughout the past month, as the COVID-19 crisis has filled hospitals with\nnew patients and scratched deep into the American economy, HVAC manufacturers\nhave provided a much-needed flood of good news. Many manufacturers have\nstepped up and are using their facilities and technologies to fight the spread\nof COVID-19.\n\nHVAC AND TEMPORARY SHELTERS\n\nSome manufacturers, like Johnson Controls and Aaon, have worked to meet the\nHVAC needs of temporary hospitals being built to deal with an influx of\ncoronavirus patients. Some of these field hospitals will use existing\nbuildings, such as convention centers or large tents. The quick timeline for\nthese buildings requires fast production of HVAC equipment to fill them.\n\nIn order to meet the demand for the equipment, the Johnson Controls ducted\nsystems team, in collaboration with its residential manufacturing facility\nlocated in Wichita, Kansas, has partnered with the distributor and contractor\nnetwork.\n\n\"Our factory built 60 5-ton, 14 SEER packaged heating and cooling units for\nthese field and pop-up hospitals around the world,\" said Randy Wyngard,\nregional account manager, Johnson Controls. \"It's important that we pivot with\nour production schedule and ensure the people in need are getting great\ncomfort and reliability coming from our manufacturing facility in Wichita. Our\nhearts and thoughts are with the health care workers on the front lines who\nare making adjustments around the country to fight COVID-19.\"\n\nThe product orders were shipped to field hospitals across multiple channels in\nearly April.\n\nAaon has done something similar in New York City, where it was asked to build\n2,200 tons of HVAC equipment for the Stony Brook temporary hospital in Stony\nBrook, New York. This 2,200 tons of equipment equates to the cooling capacity\nof more than 700 single-family homes. After receiving the order for 44 50-ton\njob-customized Aaon HVAC units, the company went into immediate 24-hour\nproduction of the equipment to ensure timely shipment and arrival of these\ncritical units at their destination in New York.\n\nMANUFACTURERS REDUCING COVID-19 TRANSMISSIONS\n\nOther HVAC companies have responded to the COVID-19 crisis by making and/or\ndonating masks to the hospitals that need them, as well as by creating other\nhygienic equipment.\n\nCoolSys, for example, has provided installation of plexiglass protective\npanels, also known as sneeze guards, at checkout counters in grocery stores,\nrestaurants, and other essential retail stores.\n\n\"During this challenging time, we are doing whatever we can to respond to the\nneeds of our customers to prevent transmission of COVID-19,\" said Adam Coffey,\nCEO at CoolSys. \"By installing sneeze guard plexi-glass panels at the point of\npurchase, retail stores can add another layer of safety and peace of mind for\ncustomers and employees.\"\n\nWhile sneeze guards are already commonly used in grocery and food service\nlocations at self-serve food bars and other areas that require a protective\nbarrier, the installation at checkout counters represents a new measure in the\neffort to contain and prevent COVID-19 transmission.\n\n\"We are happy that our field crews are able to use their skills and experience\nto install sneeze guards at some of our most important customers' locations to\nhelp keep their employees and their customers safer during this global\ncrisis,\" said Joe Roomsburg, general manager and former owner of Virginia-\nbased BRR Refrigeration, a CoolSys company.\n\nOne company, Eaton, is leveraging expertise in additive manufacturing and its\npartnership with Cleveland's Manufacturing Advocacy and Growth Network\n(MAGNET) to rapidly develop face shields for hospitals. The first batch of\nface shields made at Eaton's Additive Manufacturing Center of Excellence in\nSouthfield, Michigan, were donated to hospitals in Ohio, New York, New Jersey,\nand Michigan.\n\n\"What matters most is the ability for our health care system to respond to the\ncrisis at hand, and Eaton can help,\" said Michael Regelski, senior vice\npresident and chief technology officer, electrical sector at Eaton. \"From\ndelivering critical supplies to ensuring always-on power for essential\nelectrical systems, we're supporting our communities and the health care\nindustry during this crisis and in everyday circumstances.\"\n\n\"We greatly appreciate Eaton's donation of face shields, which will protect\ncaregivers on the front lines and help reduce the spread of the coronavirus,\"\nsaid MetroHealth president and CEO Akram Boutros, MD, FACHE. \"It is inspiring\nto see the way our community has come together, including great partners like\nEaton.\"\n\nBy applying additive manufacturing capabilities, Eaton was able to quickly\ndevelop a face shield design that is comfortable for extended wear, maximizes\nfacial protection, and can be sanitized and reused for a period of time. Eaton\nworked closely with MAGNET, MetroHealth System, university hospitals, and\nother healthcare providers to evaluate initial samples and refine the design.\nEaton is rapidly scaling up production of face shields to more traditional\nmanufacturing methods (e.g., injection molding) to deliver the volume of face\nshields needed to meet the demand of health care systems across the country.\n\nREPURPOSING PATIENT ROOMS FOR COVID-19\n\nAnother company, Clean Rooms International, has reconfigured its stock air\nfiltration products to enable hospitals to convert standard patient rooms into\nnegative pressure rooms for patient isolation.\n\n\"Health care systems are experiencing incredible pressure to accommodate\ngrowing numbers of patients impacted by the coronavirus,\" said Tim Werkema,\npresident and CEO of CRI. \"Customers came to us seeking a new way to quickly\nconvert standard hospital rooms into negative pressure rooms for quarantine.\nIn less than a week, our team of engineers repurposed dozens of units. In less\nthan a month, we've shipped more than 1,000 from coast to coast.\"\n\nDue to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, which can be transmitted through\nrespiratory droplets in the air, CRI engineers looked at its HEPA air\nfiltration product inventory. Standard HEPA fan filter units were inverted and\npaired with exhaust systems or mounted to a small cradle with castors to\ncreate mobile units.\n\nThe products are highly efficient in filtering and evacuating contaminants\nfrom the air. This creates a negative pressure environment, minimizing\nairborne contagions from entering hallways and corridors in a health facility.\n\n\"As infection levels continue to rise, hospital systems will look for new and\ninventive ways to convert their facilities to meet patient needs,\" said Bret\nAsper, chief operations officer at CRI. \"We're grateful our product engineers\nwere able to come up with a quick and cost-effective solution and we can bring\nthis to market as quickly as we did.\"\n\nBY GORDON WHITE\n\nACHR NEWS STAFF",

    "title": "HVAC Manufacturers Bring Tools, Tech to the Fight Against COVID-19: Companies help construction of temporary hospitals and work to reduce virus transmission.(INDUSTRY NEWS)",
    "html": "<p>Throughout the past month, as the COVID-19 crisis has filled\nhospitals with new patients and scratched deep into the American\neconomy, HVAC manufacturers have provided a much-needed flood of good\nnews. Many manufacturers have stepped up and are using their facilities\nand technologies to fight the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>HVAC AND TEMPORARY SHELTERS</p>\n\n<p>Some manufacturers, like <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:JCI\">Johnson Controls</org> and Aaon, have worked to\nmeet the HVAC needs of temporary hospitals being built to deal with an\ninflux of coronavirus patients. Some of these field hospitals will use\nexisting buildings, such as convention centers or large tents. The quick\ntimeline for these buildings requires fast production of HVAC equipment\nto fill them.</p>\n\n<p>In order to meet the demand for the equipment, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:JCI\">Johnson Controls</org>\nducted systems team, in collaboration with its residential manufacturing\nfacility located in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ks.wichta\">Wichita, Kansas</location>, has partnered with the distributor\nand contractor network.</p>\n\n<p>\"Our factory built 60 5-ton, 14 SEER packaged heating and\ncooling units for these field and pop-up hospitals around the\nworld,\" said <person>Randy Wyngard</person>, regional account manager, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:JCI\">Johnson\nControls</org>. \"It's important that we pivot with our production\nschedule and ensure the people in need are getting great comfort and\nreliability coming from our manufacturing facility in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ks.wichta\">Wichita</location>. Our\nhearts and thoughts are with the health care workers on the front lines\nwho are making adjustments around the country to fight COVID-19.\"</p>\n\n<p>The product orders were shipped to field hospitals across multiple\nchannels in early April.</p>\n\n<p>Aaon has done something similar in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York City</location>, where it was\nasked to build 2,200 tons of HVAC equipment for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.stoook\">Stony Brook</location>\ntemporary hospital in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.stoook\">Stony Brook, New York</location>. This 2,200 tons of\nequipment equates to the cooling capacity of more than 700 single-family\nhomes. After receiving the order for 44 50-ton job-customized Aaon HVAC\nunits, the company went into immediate 24-hour production of the\nequipment to ensure timely shipment and arrival of these critical units\nat their destination in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>.</p>\n\n<p>MANUFACTURERS REDUCING COVID-19 TRANSMISSIONS</p>\n\n<p>Other HVAC companies have responded to the COVID-19 crisis by\nmaking and/or donating masks to the hospitals that need them, as well as\nby creating other hygienic equipment.</p>\n\n<p>CoolSys, for example, has provided installation of plexiglass\nprotective panels, also known as sneeze guards, at checkout counters in\ngrocery stores, restaurants, and other essential retail stores.</p>\n\n<p>\"During this challenging time, we are doing whatever we can to\nrespond to the needs of our customers to prevent transmission of\nCOVID-19,\" said <person>Adam Coffey</person>, CEO at CoolSys. \"By installing\nsneeze guard plexi-glass panels at the point of purchase, retail stores\ncan add another layer of safety and peace of mind for customers and\nemployees.\"</p>\n\n<p>While sneeze guards are already commonly used in grocery and food\nservice locations at self-serve food bars and other areas that require a\nprotective barrier, the installation at checkout counters represents a\nnew measure in the effort to contain and prevent COVID-19 transmission.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are happy that our field crews are able to use their\nskills and experience to install sneeze guards at some of our most\nimportant customers' locations to help keep their employees and\ntheir customers safer during this global crisis,\" said <person>Joe\nRoomsburg</person>, general manager and former owner of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>-based BRR\nRefrigeration, a CoolSys company.</p>\n\n<p>One company, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.eaton\">Eaton</location>, is leveraging expertise in additive\nmanufacturing and its partnership with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">Cleveland's</location> Manufacturing\nAdvocacy and Growth Network (MAGNET) to rapidly develop face shields for\nhospitals. The first batch of face shields made at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton's</location> <org>Additive\nManufacturing Center of Excellence</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.soueld\">Southfield, Michigan</location>, were donated\nto hospitals in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"What matters most is the ability for our health care system\nto respond to the crisis at hand, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton</location> can help,\" said <person>Michael\nRegelski</person>, senior vice president and chief technology officer, electrical\nsector at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton</location>. \"From delivering critical supplies to ensuring\nalways-on power for essential electrical systems, we're supporting\nour communities and the health care industry during this crisis and in\neveryday circumstances.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We greatly appreciate <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton's</location> donation of face shields,\nwhich will protect caregivers on the front lines and help reduce the\nspread of the coronavirus,\" said <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3795736886\">MetroHealth</org> president and CEO\n<person>Akram Boutros</person>, MD, FACHE. \"It is inspiring to see the way our\ncommunity has come together, including great partners like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton</location>.\"</p>\n\n<p>By applying additive manufacturing capabilities, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton</location> was able to\nquickly develop a face shield design that is comfortable for extended\nwear, maximizes facial protection, and can be sanitized and reused for a\nperiod of time. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton</location> worked closely with MAGNET, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0190762877\">MetroHealth System</org>,\nuniversity hospitals, and other healthcare providers to evaluate initial\nsamples and refine the design. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.eaton\">Eaton</location> is rapidly scaling up production of\nface shields to more traditional manufacturing methods (e.g., injection\nmolding) to deliver the volume of face shields needed to meet the demand\nof health care systems across the country.</p>\n\n<p>REPURPOSING PATIENT ROOMS FOR COVID-19</p>\n\n<p>Another company, <org>Clean Rooms International</org>, has reconfigured its\nstock air filtration products to enable hospitals to convert standard\npatient rooms into negative pressure rooms for patient isolation.</p>\n\n<p>\"Health care systems are experiencing incredible pressure to\naccommodate growing numbers of patients impacted by the\ncoronavirus,\" said <person>Tim Werkema</person>, president and CEO of CRI.\n\"Customers came to us seeking a new way to quickly convert standard\nhospital rooms into negative pressure rooms for quarantine. In less than\na week, our team of engineers repurposed dozens of units. In less than a\nmonth, we've shipped more than 1,000 from coast to coast.\"</p>\n\n<p>Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, which can be transmitted\nthrough respiratory droplets in the air, CRI engineers looked at its\nHEPA air filtration product inventory. Standard HEPA fan filter units\nwere inverted and paired with exhaust systems or mounted to a small\ncradle with castors to create mobile units.</p>\n\n<p>The products are highly efficient in filtering and evacuating\ncontaminants from the air. This creates a negative pressure environment,\nminimizing airborne contagions from entering hallways and corridors in a\nhealth facility.</p>\n\n<p>\"As infection levels continue to rise, hospital systems will\nlook for new and inventive ways to convert their facilities to meet\npatient needs,\" said <person>Bret Asper</person>, chief operations officer at CRI.\n\"We're grateful our product engineers were able to come up\nwith a quick and cost-effective solution and we can bring this to market\nas quickly as we did.\"</p>\n\n<p>BY <person>GORDON WHITE</person></p>\n\n<p>ACHR NEWS STAFF</p>",
