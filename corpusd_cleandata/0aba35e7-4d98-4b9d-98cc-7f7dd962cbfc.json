    "text": "In my ongoing project to learn how our local live performance associations -\nmusic, drama, dance - are dealing with the pandemic, I was getting ready to\nsend my questionnaire to Eric Valinsky, president of the indispensable Santa\nBarbara Music Club, when a letter from him arrived in my inbox, answering just\nabout everything I would have asked him about. So, I will just trim it down a\nbit and pass it on.\n\n\"Early in March,\" he began, \"the Santa Barbara Music Club board realized that\nmany of our members, board members, musicians and audience are in high-risk\ngroups for COVID-19. We considered ways to make our concerts safer and whether\nto cancel concerts as needed.\n\n\"Subsequent actions by our governor and our local Department of Public Health\nrendered these discussions moot. In its last meeting, the board voted to make\nofficial our compliance with health directives and to suspend our concerts,\nsenior outreach, and scholarship auditions until it is declared safe to resume\nthem.\"\n\nEric goes on to answer, somewhat tersely, what is usually my opening question\n- what changes the crisis has made in his own life.\n\n\"[T]he degree of uncertainty is crushing,\" he says. \"We all have different\nways to deal with uncertainty. With me, it's inertia. It's taken me a month to\nstart this letter, and I'm still struggling with the words. I wish I had\nsomething definite to say about our future plans, but there is no way to do\nthis at this time.\"\n\nThere is nothing uncertain about his next statement, however: \"Our Music Club\nis in sound financial shape, and with the continued support of our members, we\nwill be able to keep the organization intact until we are able to resume\nactivities.\"\n\nFor the time being, the club's \"concert series and outreach programs have been\ncancelled, and will resume when it's no longer dangerous to do so. Meanwhile,\nwe will look at options to stream music to our community free of charge from\nour website.\"\n\nThe scholarship auditions have been similarly postponed. \"The scholarship\ncommittee and the judges rejected the idea of online or taped auditions\nbecause they felt it might give an unfair advantage to those with better\ncomputer resources. The board agreed. When the auditions resume, current\napplicants will have the opportunity to update their audition selections if\ndesired.\"\n\nAll of their decisions have been made with a view to protecting the safety of\ntheir members and the loyal music lovers who made up the capacity audiences of\ntheir fabulous free concerts. Like most of us, Maestro Valinsky is guardedly\noptimistic about the future, and wants us to know the club is in for the long\nhaul:\n\n\"Your health and safety are very important to us. We are happy that we have\nbeen able to flatten the curve, but this only means that we are at the\nstarting gate, not the finish line. We have lessened the frequency of\ninfection and we haven't exhausted our medical resources, but the ultimate\nnumber of infections and death toll depends on the availability of treatment\nand eventually, of a vaccine.\n\n\"Until that happens, you must take every step to avoid infection, including\nsheltering at home, using a mask when you need to go out, and washing your\nhands or using hand sanitizer frequently. Please stay safe and healthy.\"\n\nThe letter concludes: \"Much love to all of you, Eric Valinsky.\"\n\nFor more information about the Music Club, or to offer support, go online to\n[www.sbmusicclub.org](http://www.sbmusicclub.org).\n\n\\- Gerald Carpenter covers the arts as a Noozhawk contributing writer.

    "html": "<p>In my ongoing project to learn how our local live performance associations - music, drama, dance - are dealing with the pandemic, I was getting ready to send my questionnaire to <person>Eric Valinsky</person>, president of the indispensable <org>Santa Barbara Music Club</org>, when a letter from him arrived in my inbox, answering just about everything I would have asked him about. So, I will just trim it down a bit and pass it on.</p>\n<p>\"Early in March,\" he began, \"the <org>Santa Barbara Music Club</org> board realized that many of our members, board members, musicians and audience are in high-risk groups for COVID-19. We considered ways to make our concerts safer and whether to cancel concerts as needed.</p>\n\n<p>\"Subsequent actions by our governor and our local <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2106923035\">Department of Public Health</org> rendered these discussions moot. In its last meeting, the board voted to make official our compliance with health directives and to suspend our concerts, senior outreach, and scholarship auditions until it is declared safe to resume them.\"</p>\n\n<p>Eric goes on to answer, somewhat tersely, what is usually my opening question - what changes the crisis has made in his own life.</p>\n\n<p>\"[T]he degree of uncertainty is crushing,\" he says. \"We all have different ways to deal with uncertainty. With me, it's inertia. It's taken me a month to start this letter, and I'm still struggling with the words. I wish I had something definite to say about our future plans, but there is no way to do this at this time.\"</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing uncertain about his next statement, however: \"Our <org>Music Club</org> is in sound financial shape, and with the continued support of our members, we will be able to keep the organization intact until we are able to resume activities.\"</p>\n\n<p>For the time being, the club's \"concert series and outreach programs have been cancelled, and will resume when it's no longer dangerous to do so. Meanwhile, we will look at options to stream music to our community free of charge from our website.\"</p>\n\n<p>The scholarship auditions have been similarly postponed. \"The scholarship committee and the judges rejected the idea of online or taped auditions because they felt it might give an unfair advantage to those with better computer resources. The board agreed. When the auditions resume, current applicants will have the opportunity to update their audition selections if desired.\"</p>\n\n<p>All of their decisions have been made with a view to protecting the safety of their members and the loyal music lovers who made up the capacity audiences of their fabulous free concerts. Like most of us, Maestro Valinsky is guardedly optimistic about the future, and wants us to know the club is in for the long haul:</p>\n\n<p>\"Your health and safety are very important to us. We are happy that we have been able to flatten the curve, but this only means that we are at the starting gate, not the finish line. We have lessened the frequency of infection and we haven't exhausted our medical resources, but the ultimate number of infections and death toll depends on the availability of treatment and eventually, of a vaccine.</p>\n\n<p>\"Until that happens, you must take every step to avoid infection, including sheltering at home, using a mask when you need to go out, and washing your hands or using hand sanitizer frequently. Please stay safe and healthy.\"</p>\n\n<p>The letter concludes: \"Much love to all of you, <person>Eric Valinsky</person>.\"</p>\n\n<p>For more information about the <org>Music Club</org>, or to offer support, go online to <a href=\"http://www.sbmusicclub.org\">www.sbmusicclub.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>- <person>Gerald Carpenter</person> covers the arts as a Noozhawk contributing writer.
