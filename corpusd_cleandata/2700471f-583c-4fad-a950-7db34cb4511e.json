    "text": "CLEVELAND (WJW) - The \"I Can't Breathe\" Justice for George Floyd protest\nturned violent. Protesters have stormed the streets of downtown, thrown items\nat officers and vandalized city property and businesses.\n\nThe protest was organized by Black Lives Matter Cleveland in response to\nFloyd's death. Floyd died while in Minneapolis police custody, sparking\ndemonstrations across the country.\n\nProtesters met at the Free Stamp on Lakeside Avenue Saturday afternoon. The\ndemonstration started off peaceful. People gathering at the protest could be\nheard saying, \"No justice, no peace,\" I can't breathe,\" and \"black lives\nmatter.\"\n\nMuch of the crowd marched to Public Square, where the events remained calm.\nBut a crowd at the Cuyahoga County Justice Center threw objects at officers\nand tried to break windows, police said.\n\nOfficers in riot gear formed a line in front of the county building. Tear gas\nwas used several times as police warned the crowd to disperse.\n\nFirefighters responded to West 3rd Street and Lakeside Avenue for two police\ncars set on fire. Injuries are unknown at this time.\n\nCleveland police said traffic was shut down coming into downtown. Please avoid\ndowntown at this time.\n\nAt about 5:45 p.m., Cleveland police were still advising people against coming\ninto downtown.\n\nCleveland police reported people throwing things at the mounted unit horses.\n\nOur crew in SkyFOX spotted a burning van near another burned-out car in front\nof the Cuyahoga County Justice Center. In a parking lot off of West 3rd\nStreet, more cars burned.\n\nColumbus police declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, as seen in\nthe video, below.\n\nThe state of emergency, as laid out by Columbus City Code and the Ohio Revised\nCode, means that anyone who does not leave the area is subject to be removed\nby authorities regardless of their reason for being there.\n\nPolice say violators can face criminal charges.\n\nAccording to Catherine Ross, a reporter for our sister station WCMH, the crowd\nbegan their protest by gathering in front of the Ohio statehouse. Protesters\nwere calling for justice and yelling, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nFloyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer\nknelt on his neck during an arrest Monday.\n\nThat police officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with\nthird-degree murder and manslaughter.\n\nThree other officers were fired.\n\nContinuing coverage of this story here",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">CLEVELAND</location> (WJW) - The \"I Can't Breathe\" Justice for <person>George Floyd</person> protest turned violent. Protesters have stormed the streets of downtown, thrown items at officers and vandalized city property and businesses.</p>\n<p>The protest was organized by Black Lives Matter Cleveland in response to Floyd's death. Floyd died while in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police custody, sparking demonstrations across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Protesters met at the Free Stamp on <location>Lakeside Avenue</location> Saturday afternoon. The demonstration started off peaceful. People gathering at the protest could be heard saying, \"No justice, no peace,\" I can't breathe,\" and \"black lives matter.\"</p>\n\n<p>Much of the crowd marched to <location>Public Square</location>, where the events remained calm. But a crowd at the <org>Cuyahoga County Justice Center</org> threw objects at officers and tried to break windows, police said.</p>\n\n<p>Officers in riot gear formed a line in front of the county building. Tear gas was used several times as police warned the crowd to disperse.</p>\n\n<p>Firefighters responded to <location>West 3rd Street</location> and <location>Lakeside Avenue</location> for two police cars set on fire. Injuries are unknown at this time.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">Cleveland</location> police said traffic was shut down coming into downtown. Please avoid downtown at this time.</p>\n\n<p>At about <chron>5:45 p.m.</chron>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">Cleveland</location> police were still advising people against coming into downtown.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">Cleveland</location> police reported people throwing things at the mounted unit horses.</p>\n\n<p>Our crew in SkyFOX spotted a burning van near another burned-out car in front of the <org>Cuyahoga County Justice Center</org>. In a parking lot off of <location>West 3rd Street</location>, more cars burned.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.colbus\">Columbus</location> police declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, as seen in the video, below.</p>\n\n<p>The state of emergency, as laid out by Columbus City Code and the Ohio Revised Code, means that anyone who does not leave the area is subject to be removed by authorities regardless of their reason for being there.</p>\n\n<p>Police say violators can face criminal charges.</p>\n\n<p>According to <person>Catherine Ross</person>, a reporter for our sister station WCMH, the crowd began their protest by gathering in front of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> statehouse. Protesters were calling for justice and yelling, \"I can't breathe.\"</p>\n\n<p>Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a white <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest Monday.</p>\n\n<p>That police officer, <person>Derek Chauvin</person>, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.</p>\n\n<p>Three other officers were fired.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing coverage of this story here</p>",
