    "text": "Washington: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nhas issued the following order:\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA Miami\nDivision Case Number: 20-21069-CIV-MORENO ERNESTO PANTOJA, Plaintiff, vs.\nAMERICAN SECURITY INS. CO., Defendant.\n_________________________________________/ ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL\nAPPRAISAL THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendant's Motion to Compel\nAppraisal and Stay Proceedings (D.E. 4), filed on March 18, 2020. THE COURT\nhas considered the motion, the response, the pertinent portions of the record,\nand being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is ADJUDGED that the\nmotion to compel appraisal and stay proceedings is GRANTED and all other\npending motions are DENIED as moot. I. Background Plaintiff, Ernesto Pantoja,\nbrought this case against Defendant, American Security Insurance Company, for\nbreach of an insurance policy. The policy provides insurance coverage to\nPlaintiff's residential property located at 875 West 72nd Street, Hialeah,\nFlorida 33014\\. On November 25, 2019, Plaintiff reported damage sustained as a\nresult of Hurricane Irma on September 10, 2017. On November 26, 2019,\nDefendant sent Plaintiff a letter advising Plaintiff of his right to mediation\nunder Florida Statute SS 627.7015. An independent adjuster inspected the\nproperty on December 17, 2019, and submitted an estimate of $3,765.03. On\nDecember 17, 2019, Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket\n05/26/2020 Page 1 of 7 2 Defendant American Security Insurance sent Plaintiff\nan Explanation of Benefits letter, which states that the repair and\nreplacement costs for Plaintiff's claim was $3,765.03. Plaintiff estimates\ndamage to his roof and leaks totaling $137,235.34. Plaintiff filed this case\nin state court on February 5, 2020, and Defendant removed the case to this\nCourt on March 10, 2020. On March 5, 2020, Defendant invoked its right to\nappraisal and filed this motion to compel appraisal on March 18, 2020. The\npolicy provides that if the parties disagree on the value of the residential\nproperty or on the amount of the loss, either may request an appraisal of the\nloss, in writing. II. Analysis Motions to compel appraisal should be granted\nwhenever the parties have agreed to the provision. Calderon v. Scottsdale Ins.\nCo., No. 19-21012, 2019 WL 4954790 at *1 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 7, 2019). \"Enforcing\nappraisal provisions are preferred over lawsuits as they provide a mechanism\nfor prompt resolution of claims and discourage the filing of needless\nlawsuits.\" Id. (quoting First Protective Ins. Co. v. Hess, 81 So. 3d 482,485\n(Fla. 1st DCA 2011)). Consistent with this public policy, which favors\nenforcing appraisal provisions, the Court finds it appropriate to compel\nappraisal of this case. Plaintiff claims that because Defendant denied over\n90% of his claim, the dispute is one of coverage for this Court to decide and\nnot for an appraiser. Gonzalez v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 805 So. 2d 814,\n817 (Fla. 3d DCA 2000) (stating that whether a claim is covered entirely by\nthe policy is a judicial question, not a question for an appraiser). Defendant\ndisputes that this is a coverage dispute and asserts that it extended\ncoverage, although it provided limited insurance benefits to remedy the\nproperty damage claimed. In its view, some of the damage Plaintiff was\nclaiming was due to wear and tear and humidity, conditions not covered by the\npolicy. In this case, the December 17, 2019 Explanation of Benefits letter\nstated: \"The roof is damaged from wear, Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25\nEntered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2020 Page 2 of 7 3 tear, and deterioration. The\nefficiency bathroom is not the result of roof leaks but from humidity. This\nportion of your claim is not covered under the policy you have with our\ncompany.\" Defendant's position is that since it provided coverage, but\ndisagreed as to the value of the damage caused by Hurricane Irma to\nPlaintiff's property, the appraiser should decide the amount to be paid.\nPlaintiff argues this case is like Flaharty v. Allstate Ins. Co., No.\n09-cv-499, 2010 WL 148226 (N.D. Fla. Jan. 11, 2010). where the court found\nthat appraisal was not appropriate where the insurance company denied coverage\nfor a portion of the damages and not for the entire claim. The court denied\nthe motion to compel appraisal finding that the threshold question is whether\nthere was coverage for the damage, and therefore, appraisal was not available.\nFlaharty, however, is a case that involves a Standard Flood Insurance Policy\nissued pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act. Id. at *2. Under this\nfederal law, courts must apply federal law, and not state law, to decide\nissues of coverage and causation. Id. at *3. Indeed, in Flaharty, the court\nnoted that the Standard Flood Insurance Policy provides for appraisal when the\nparties disagree on the cash value of the damaged property, not when the\nparties disagree on issues of coverage and causation. Id. It is more\nappropriate for this Court to review cases deciding the issue under Florida\nlaw, as this policy is not governed by federal law involving the Standard\nFlood Insurance Policy like Flaharty. Florida law is clear that where an\ninsurer has extended coverage for any part of the claim, the insurer may\ncompel appraisal even after Plaintiff has filed suit. In Wilson v. Fed. Nat.\nIns. Co., 969 So. 2d 1133, 1134 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007), the court held that a\nproperty insurer may invoke appraisal after a policyholder has filed an action\nfor breach of the insurance action. See also Gimenez v. American Sec. Ins.\nCo., 08-2495, 2009 WL 257540, *2 (M.D. Fla. Fed. 3, 2009) (stating that an\ninsurer is not divested of a right to invoke appraisal merely by complying\nwith Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2020 Page\n3 of 7 4 one's duties as a defense litigant, and stating that stays have been\ngranted even after summary judgment stage of litigation). Therefore, the\ntiming of Defendant's request for appraisal, soon after Plaintiff filed the\nsuit, does not show conduct that is inconsistent with the right to appraisal,\nsuch that this Court can find that Defendant waived its right. The real\nquestion seems to be whether the December 17, 2019 Explanation of Benefits\nletter extends coverage for damage and presents a dispute about the cash value\nof the Plaintiff's claim, such that appraisal is warranted. In Johnson v.\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 828 So. 2d 1021, 1022 (Fla. 2002), the court stated\nthat \"causation is a coverage question for the court when an insurer wholly\ndenies that there is a covered loss . . . [but] the amount is disputed.\" See\nalso Gonzalez, 805 So. 2d at 816 (\"[W]hen the insurer admits that there is a\ncovered loss, but there is a disagreement on the amount of the loss, it is for\nthe appraisers to arrive at the amount to be paid.\"). Defendant contends that\nbecause it extended coverage on the claim, even though it paid only a small\nportion of Plaintiff's claimed damages, the appraiser is charged to examine\nwhat caused the damage to the property. Gonzalez, 805 So. 2d at 816 (\"[T]he\nappraisers are to inspect the property and sort out how much is to be paid on\naccount of a covered peril. In doing so, they are to exclude payment for a\ncause not covered, such as normal wear and tear, dry rot, or various other\ndesignated, excluded causes.\") (quoting State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Licea,\n685 So. 2d 1285, 1288 (Fla. 1996)). Defendant claims that in its Explanation\nof Benefits Letter, it did not dispute coverage altogether, rather it disputed\nthe causes of the roof and bathroom damage. Plaintiff's position is that by\nawarding him only a small portion of what he believed his claim was worth,\nDefendant effectively denied coverage, which is an issue for this Court to\ndecide. Following Gonzalez, the Third District Court of Appeal held that where\nan insurer does not wholly deny coverage, \"causation is an amount-of-loss\nquestion for the appraisal panel, not a coverage Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM\nDocument 25 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2020 Page 4 of 7 5 question that can\nonly be decided by the court.\" People's Trust Ins. Co. v. Garcia, 263 So. 3d\n231, 238 (Fla. 3d DCA 2019) (finding trial court erred in denying motion to\ncompel appraisal). Appraisal umpires may decide issues of causation. Kendall\nLakes Townhomes Developers, Inc. v. Agricultural Excess & Surplus Lines Ins.\nCo., 916 So. 2d 12, 15 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005) (\"[A]lthough there is a large\ndiscrepancy between the insured's [$716,000] and the insurance carrier's\nestimate [less than $1,000] of loss, because the insurer has not wholly denied\nthat there is a covered loss, causation is 'an amount-of-loss question for the\nappraisal panel,' not a coverage question that can only be decided by the\ntrial court.\") (citing Johnson, 828 So. 2d at 1022). Here, the letter at issue\nindicates that the Defendant estimates the repair and replacement costs on the\nproperty to be $3,765.03. It explains that the policy \"provides coverage on an\nactual cash value basis until repairs or replacements have been completed.\" It\nthen states that the roof is damaged from wear, tear, and deterioration. The\ndamage to the efficiency bathroom is not the result of roof leaks but from\nhumidity. It adds that \"this portion of the claim is not covered.\" Because\ncoverage was extended, at least in part, this Court properly delegates the\ndecision regarding causation to the appraiser under Johnson, Gonzalez, and\nGarcia. Plaintiff raises the issue that the insurance company failed to comply\nwith Florida Statute SS 627.7015(2), which requires the insurance company to\nadvise the policyholder of a right to mediation. The statute states that if an\ninsurance company fails to advise a policyholder of a right to mediation, then\n\"the policyholder is not required to submit to or participate in any\ncontractual loss appraisal process of the property loss damage as a\nprecondition to legal action for breach of contract against the insurer for\nits failure to pay the policyholder's claims covered by the policy.\" SS\n627.7015(7), Fla. Stat.; Universal Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Colosimo, 61 So.\n3d 1241, 1243 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (stating that \"the plain language of section\n627.7015, as well as that of rule 69- Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25\nEntered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2020 Page 5 of 7 6 166.031, clearly provide that\nif an insurer fails to supply written notice of the right to mediate, the\ninsured shall not be required to engage in a contractual loss appraisal\nprocess as a prerequisite to litigation.\"). Here, the insurance company\nprovided written notice on the day following the initial claim, November 26,\n2019, advising Plaintiff of his right to appraisal and mediation. Therefore,\nthe Court finds the Defendant properly complied with the statutory notice\nrequirements, and this argument does not constitute grounds for denying\nappraisal. Plaintiff's final argument is that because he has already performed\nrepairs on the property, appraisal is improper as set forth in Weiss v. Ins.\nCo. of the State of Penn., 497 So. 2d 285, 286 (Fla. 3d DCA 1986). In Weiss,\nthe court found that by exercising its right to repair the vehicle, the\ninsurance company could not then invoke the appraisal clause. By authorizing\nthe repair of the vehicle, the insurance carrier could not then refuse to pay\nthe bill. That is not the case here, as the Defendant did not authorize\nrepairs on Plaintiff's property, which it later refused to pay. Therefore,\nthis Defendant, unlike the insurance company in Weiss, may properly invoke\nappraisal. See State Farm & Cas. Co. v. Middleton, 648 So. 2d 1200, 1201 n. 4\n(Fla. 3d DCA 1995) (stating that defendant insurance company did not waive\nright to appraisal because it advanced money for repairs). Here, to the extent\nPlaintiff repaired the property, those repairs do not preclude Defendant from\ninvoking appraisal. The appraiser may consider the value of those repairs.\nAccordingly, it is ADJUDGED that the motion to compel appraisal and stay\nproceedings is GRANTED. It is also ADJUDGED that: I. The Clerk of this Court\nshall mark this cause as closed for statistical purposes and place the matter\nin a civil suspense file. Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD\nDocket 05/26/2020 Page 6 of 7 7 II. The Court shall retain jurisdiction and\nthe case shall be restored to the active docket upon motion of a party if\ncircumstances change so that this action may proceed to final disposition.\nIII. This order shall not prejudice the rights of the parties to this\nlitigation. IV. Plaintiff SHALL notify the Court by August 12, 2020 and every\nthree months thereafter of the current status of the proceedings and when this\naction is ready to proceed.

CO., Defendant.\n_________________________________________/ ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO\nCOMPEL APPRAISAL THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendant's\nMotion to Compel Appraisal and Stay Proceedings (D.E. 4), filed on <chron>March\n18, 2020</chron>. THE COURT has considered the motion, the response, the\npertinent portions of the record, and being otherwise fully advised in\nthe premises, it is ADJUDGED that the motion to compel appraisal and\nstay proceedings is GRANTED and all other pending motions are DENIED as\nmoot. I. Background Plaintiff, <person>Ernesto Pantoja</person>, brought this case\nagainst Defendant, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0913430995\">American Security Insurance Company</org>, for breach of an\ninsurance policy. The policy provides insurance coverage to\nPlaintiff's residential property located at <location>875 West 72nd Street</location>,\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.hiaeah\">Hialeah, Florida</location> 33014. On <chron>November 25, 2019</chron>, Plaintiff reported damage\nsustained as a result of Hurricane Irma on <chron>September 10, 2017</chron>. On\n<chron>November 26, 2019</chron>, Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter advising Plaintiff\nof his right to mediation under Florida Statute SS 627.7015. An\nindependent adjuster inspected the property on <chron>December 17, 2019</chron>, and\nsubmitted an estimate of <money>$3,765.03</money>. On <chron>December 17, 2019</chron>, Case\n1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket <chron>05/26/2020</chron> Page 1\nof 7 2 <org>Defendant American Security Insurance</org> sent Plaintiff an\nExplanation of Benefits letter, which states that the repair and\nreplacement costs for Plaintiff's claim was <money>$3,765.03</money>. Plaintiff\nestimates damage to his roof and leaks totaling <money>$137,235.34</money>. Plaintiff\nfiled this case in state court on <chron>February 5, 2020</chron>, and Defendant\nremoved the case to this Court on <chron>March 10, 2020</chron>. On <chron>March 5, 2020</chron>,\nDefendant invoked its right to appraisal and filed this motion to compel\nappraisal on <chron>March 18, 2020</chron>. The policy provides that if the parties\ndisagree on the value of the residential property or on the amount of\nthe loss, either may request an appraisal of the loss, in writing. II.\nAnalysis Motions to compel appraisal should be granted whenever the\nparties have agreed to the provision. Calderon v. Scottsdale Ins. Co.,\nNo. 19-21012, 2019 WL 4954790 at *1 (<person>S.D. Fla</person>. <chron>Oct. 7, 2019</chron>).\n\"Enforcing appraisal provisions are preferred over lawsuits as they\nprovide a mechanism for prompt resolution of claims and discourage the\nfiling of needless lawsuits.\" Id. (quoting First Protective Ins.\nCo. v. <org>Hess</org>, 81 So. 3d 482,485 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011)). Consistent with\nthis public policy, which favors enforcing appraisal provisions, the\nCourt finds it appropriate to compel appraisal of this case. Plaintiff\nclaims that because Defendant denied over 90% of his claim, the dispute\nis one of coverage for this Court to decide and not for an appraiser.\nGonzalez v. State Farm Fire &amp; <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Korea:016920\">Cas. Co.</org>, 805 So. 2d 814, 817 (Fla. 3d\nDCA 2000) (stating that whether a claim is covered entirely by the\npolicy is a judicial question, not a question for an appraiser).\nDefendant disputes that this is a coverage dispute and asserts that it\nextended coverage, although it provided limited insurance benefits to\nremedy the property damage claimed. In its view, some of the damage\nPlaintiff was claiming was due to wear and tear and humidity, conditions\nnot covered by the policy. In this case, the <chron>December 17, 2019</chron>\nExplanation of Benefits letter stated: \"The roof is damaged from\nwear, Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket\n<chron>05/26/2020</chron> Page 2 of 7 3 tear, and deterioration. The efficiency\nbathroom is not the result of roof leaks but from humidity. This portion\nof your claim is not covered under the policy you have with our\ncompany.\" Defendant's position is that since it provided\ncoverage, but disagreed as to the value of the damage caused by\nHurricane Irma to Plaintiff's property, the appraiser should decide\nthe amount to be paid. Plaintiff argues this case is like Flaharty v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., No. 09-cv-499, 2010 WL 148226 (<person>N.D. Fla</person>. <chron>Jan. 11,\n2010</chron>). where the court found that appraisal was not appropriate where\nthe insurance company denied coverage for a portion of the damages and\nnot for the entire claim. The court denied the motion to compel\nappraisal finding that the threshold question is whether there was\ncoverage for the damage, and therefore, appraisal was not available.\nFlaharty, however, is a case that involves a Standard Flood Insurance\nPolicy issued pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act. Id. at *2.\nUnder this federal law, courts must apply federal law, and not state\nlaw, to decide issues of coverage and causation. Id. at *3. Indeed, in\nFlaharty, the court noted that the Standard Flood Insurance Policy\nprovides for appraisal when the parties disagree on the cash value of\nthe damaged property, not when the parties disagree on issues of\ncoverage and causation. Id. It is more appropriate for this Court to\nreview cases deciding the issue under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> law, as this policy is not\ngoverned by federal law involving the Standard Flood Insurance Policy\nlike Flaharty. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> law is clear that where an insurer has extended\ncoverage for any part of the claim, the insurer may compel appraisal\neven after Plaintiff has filed suit. In Wilson v. Fed. Nat. Ins. Co.,\n969 So. 2d 1133, 1134 (Fla. 2d DCA 2007), the court held that a property\ninsurer may invoke appraisal after a policyholder has filed an action\nfor breach of the insurance action. See also Gimenez v. American Sec.\nIns. Co., 08-2495, 2009 WL 257540, *2 (<person>M.D. Fla</person>. Fed. 3, 2009) (stating\nthat an insurer is not divested of a right to invoke appraisal merely by\ncomplying with Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket\n<chron>05/26/2020</chron> Page 3 of 7 4 one's duties as a defense litigant, and\nstating that stays have been granted even after summary judgment stage\nof litigation). Therefore, the timing of Defendant's request for\nappraisal, soon after Plaintiff filed the suit, does not show conduct\nthat is inconsistent with the right to appraisal, such that this Court\ncan find that Defendant waived its right. The real question seems to be\nwhether the <chron>December 17, 2019</chron> Explanation of Benefits letter extends\ncoverage for damage and presents a dispute about the cash value of the\nPlaintiff's claim, such that appraisal is warranted. In Johnson v.\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 828 So. 2d 1021, 1022 (Fla. 2002), the court\nstated that \"causation is a coverage question for the court when an\ninsurer wholly denies that there is a covered loss . . . [but] the\namount is disputed.\" See also Gonzalez, 805 So. 2d at 816\n(\"[W]hen the insurer admits that there is a covered loss, but there\nis a disagreement on the amount of the loss, it is for the appraisers to\narrive at the amount to be paid.\"). Defendant contends that because\nit extended coverage on the claim, even though it paid only a small\nportion of Plaintiff's claimed damages, the appraiser is charged to\nexamine what caused the damage to the property. Gonzalez, 805 So. 2d at\n816 (\"[T]he appraisers are to inspect the property and sort out how\nmuch is to be paid on account of a covered peril. In doing so, they are\nto exclude payment for a cause not covered, such as normal wear and\ntear, dry rot, or various other designated, excluded causes.\")\n(quoting State Farm Fire &amp; <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Korea:016920\">Cas. Co.</org> v. Licea, 685 So. 2d 1285, 1288\n(Fla. 1996)). Defendant claims that in its Explanation of Benefits\nLetter, it did not dispute coverage altogether, rather it disputed the\ncauses of the roof and bathroom damage. Plaintiff's position is\nthat by awarding him only a small portion of what he believed his claim\nwas worth, Defendant effectively denied coverage, which is an issue for\nthis Court to decide. Following Gonzalez, the <org>Third District Court of\nAppeal</org> held that where an insurer does not wholly deny coverage,\n\"causation is an amount-of-loss question for the appraisal panel,\nnot a coverage Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM Document 25 Entered on FLSD Docket\n<chron>05/26/2020</chron> Page 4 of 7 5 question that can only be decided by the\ncourt.\" People's Trust Ins. Co. v. Garcia, 263 So. 3d 231, 238\n(Fla. 3d DCA 2019) (finding trial court erred in denying motion to\ncompel appraisal). Appraisal umpires may decide issues of causation.\n<org>Kendall Lakes Townhomes Developers, Inc.</org> v. Agricultural Excess &amp;\nSurplus Lines Ins. Co., 916 So. 2d 12, 15 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005)\n(\"[A]lthough there is a large discrepancy between the\ninsured's [<money>$716,000</money>] and the insurance carrier's estimate\n[less than <money>$1,000</money>] of loss, because the insurer has not wholly denied\nthat there is a covered loss, causation is 'an amount-of-loss\nquestion for the appraisal panel,' not a coverage question that can\nonly be decided by the trial court.\") (citing Johnson, 828 So. 2d\nat 1022). Here, the letter at issue indicates that the Defendant\nestimates the repair and replacement costs on the property to be\n<money>$3,765.03</money>. It explains that the policy \"provides coverage on an\nactual cash value basis until repairs or replacements have been\ncompleted.\" It then states that the roof is damaged from wear,\ntear, and deterioration. The damage to the efficiency bathroom is not\nthe result of roof leaks but from humidity. It adds that \"this\nportion of the claim is not covered.\" Because coverage was\nextended, at least in part, this Court properly delegates the decision\nregarding causation to the appraiser under Johnson, Gonzalez, and\nGarcia. Plaintiff raises the issue that the insurance company failed to\ncomply with Florida Statute SS 627.7015(2), which requires the insurance\ncompany to advise the policyholder of a right to mediation. The statute\nstates that if an insurance company fails to advise a policyholder of a\nright to mediation, then \"the policyholder is not required to\nsubmit to or participate in any contractual loss appraisal process of\nthe property loss damage as a precondition to legal action for breach of\ncontract against the insurer for its failure to pay the\npolicyholder's claims covered by the policy.\" SS 627.7015(7),\nFla. Stat.; Universal Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Colosimo, 61 So. 3d\n1241, 1243 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (stating that \"the plain language of\nsection 627.7015, as well as that of rule 69- Case 1:20-cv-21069-FAM\nDocument 25 Entered on FLSD Docket <chron>05/26/2020</chron> Page 5 of 7 6 166.031,\nclearly provide that if an insurer fails to supply written notice of the\nright to mediate, the insured shall not be required to engage in a\ncontractual loss appraisal process as a prerequisite to\nlitigation.\"). Here, the insurance company provided written notice\non the day following the initial claim, <chron>November 26, 2019</chron>, advising\nPlaintiff of his right to appraisal and mediation. Therefore, the Court\nfinds the Defendant properly complied with the statutory notice\nrequirements, and this argument does not constitute grounds for denying\nappraisal. Plaintiff's final argument is that because he has\nalready performed repairs on the property, appraisal is improper as set\nforth in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0450916014\">Weiss</org> v. Ins. Co. of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">State of Penn.</location>, 497 So. 2d 285, 286\n(Fla. 3d DCA 1986). In <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0450916014\">Weiss</org>, the court found that by exercising its\nright to repair the vehicle, the insurance company could not then invoke\nthe appraisal clause. By authorizing the repair of the vehicle, the\ninsurance carrier could not then refuse to pay the bill. That is not the\ncase here, as the Defendant did not authorize repairs on\nPlaintiff's property, which it later refused to pay. Therefore,\nthis Defendant, unlike the insurance company in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0450916014\">Weiss</org>, may properly\ninvoke appraisal. <org>See State Farm &amp; Cas</org>. Co. v. Middleton, 648 So. 2d\n1200, 1201 n. 4 (Fla. 3d DCA 1995) (stating that defendant insurance\ncompany did not waive right to appraisal because it advanced money for\nrepairs). Here, to the extent Plaintiff repaired the property, those\nrepairs do not preclude Defendant from invoking appraisal. The appraiser\nmay consider the value of those repairs. Accordingly, it is ADJUDGED\nthat the motion to compel appraisal and stay proceedings is GRANTED. It\nis also ADJUDGED that: I. The Clerk of this Court shall mark this cause\nas closed for statistical purposes and place the matter in a civil\nsuspense file.
