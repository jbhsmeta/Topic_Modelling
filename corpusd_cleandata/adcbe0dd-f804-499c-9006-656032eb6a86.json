    "text": "MADISON \\- Despite a record-setting year for Wisconsin tourism in 2019, the\nindustry is now scrambling to adjust to the shock of coronavirus while hoping\nthe Memorial Day weekend can start a comeback to mitigate millions of dollars\nin losses.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that tossed the statewide stay-at-home\nextension, due to expire May 26, has resulted in hope and uncertainty as the\ncrucial traditional start of summer approaches. A patchwork of local rules and\nlingering reluctance to embrace usual activities could put a damper on things.\n\nEven before the latest development, the city of Milwaukee has pegged its\nlosses at $47 million and Dane County at $32.5 million due to event\ncancellations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Travel Association reported Wisconsin is\nlosing millions of dollars every week of the pandemic. The year-over-year net\nchange in weekly travel spending for the week of March 7 was a deficit of $11\nmillion and for the week April 25 it skyrocketed to a $218 million loss.\n\nWisconsin Department of Tourism Secretary Sara Meaney said the economic impact\nof 2019 was \"a record setting year, and the largest year for Wisconsin in at\nleast a decade\" and higher than the national average.\n\nThe year's numbers came in at about $22.2 billion in total tourism business\nsales. Wisconsin's 113 million visitors alone spent $13.7 billion, supporting\nmore than 202,000 full- and part-time jobs.\n\nBut that all changed with the coronavirus hit.\n\n\"We need financial help before more people are laid off so that we can make\nthe appropriate shifts to our marketing strategies, our event planning and our\nadvertising buys,\" said Meaney. \"We need relief now so we are ready to go the\nsecond we get the green light from public health officials.\"\n\nRob Gard, director of public relations and communications for Destination\nMadison, says the community will continue to follow the guidelines set out by\nGov. Tony Evers as both Madison and Dane County had similar orders in place.\n\n\"Consequently, we don't anticipate notable tourism activity for Memorial Day\nweekend,\" Gard said.\n\nLeah Hauck, communications manager for the Wisconsin Dells Visitor &\nConvention Bureau, says the group had \"no way of knowing what to expect\" for\nMemorial Day and \"wouldn't want to speculate.\"\n\n\"The Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau is waiting for further\ndirection and guidance from county and local health officials,\" she said in an\nemail. \"It is imperative that we, as a destination, all do our part to open\nand run businesses safely and responsibly.\"\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association expects downturns in the national travel industry\nas a result of coronavirus will contribute to the national economy entering a\nrecession. The organization argues that a recession could result from travel\nlosses alone and last at least two quarters with the lowest point in the\nsecond quarter of 2020.\n\nThe association also predicts an 81 percent drop in revenue over the next two\nmonths and continued losses over the rest of the year reaching $519 billion.\nIn the week ending April 25, the travel economy fell 89 percent below last\nyear's levels; national weekly travel spending is at a new low of $2.3\nbillion.\n\nThe group says \"it remains to be seen how responsive travel spending will be\nin states that are easing their lockdown measures in the coming weeks.\"\n\nLast year, outdoor recreation was the top marketable driver of visits to\nWisconsin \\- about $17.9 billion in consumer spending and 168,000 jobs.\nTwenty-seven percent of visitor spending was for lodging, followed by food and\nbeverage (26), retail (20), recreation (14) and transportation (13).\n\nAnd one of those outdoor recreation spaces equipped with lodging, food and\nretail is the Wisconsin Dells area, which is expecting a \"detrimental\" loss\nthis year due to coronavirus.\n\nIn 2019, the spring and summer seasons accounted for 66 percent of direct\nvisitor spending in Wisconsin Dells, income crucial to many businesses and\nemployees, according to Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau\nPresident and CEO Romy Snyder.\n\n\"It will take time to correctly analyze and know the true financial impact of\nCOVID-19 on Wisconsin Dells, but we do know the loss will be detrimental to\nthe local tourism economy,\" he said.\n\nWhile Lake Geneva has had a \"very strong\" January and February with a\nsuccessful Winterfest and National Snow Sculpting Championship event,\nStephanie Klett, the former state tourism secretary and president and CEO of\nVISIT Lake Geneva, said that \"like the whole country, (quarter two) was like a\nbomb going off.\"\n\nWhile Klett couldn't predict exact losses, she said most people have moved\ntheir summer business to fall such as weddings, family reunions, meetings and\nconventions.\n\n\"Fall is becoming the new summer, and we are hoping to make up for lost time,\"\nshe said.\n\nAnd Klett is convinced that Lake Geneva is positioned well for recovery\nbecause of its location between Chicago and Milwaukee, a spot that \"gives us\naccess to millions of potential visitors\" because of the drivable distance.\n\nAccording to Klett, 75 percent of Americans don't want to fly at this time,\n\"they feel safer in their own car, and within a couple hours of home.\"\n\nAnd since physical distancing has become important to consumers, Lake Geneva's\noutdoor recreation opportunities and nearby state parks give \"room to roam.\"\n\nWhile VISIT Lake Geneva is focusing on preparing the region from a marketing\nstandpoint to reopen, Klett is asking the state to set aside politics and let\neveryone be a part of the solution.\n\n\"Character is revealed through crisis, and there is no time for partisan\npolitics,\" she said. \"People are dying and businesses are fighting for their\nfinancial lives. Please provide accurate information and a solid plan for re-\nopening that is neither overly-generalized or vague.\"\n\nAs smaller tourism agencies look to the state for leadership, Meaney is asking\nfor help in return to lobby on her behalf to make sure the tourism industry is\nincluded in any COVID-19 relief money.\n\nIn early April, Meaney briefed more than 130 Wisconsin state legislators and\ntheir staff about COVID-19's toll on the tourism industry and how lawmakers\ncould help it lead the economic recovery. In a newsletter to businesses, she\nencouraged people to talk to their elected leaders about two proposals for\n\"the kinds of action we need\": $2 million for a regional destination marketing\norganization grant program; and $3 million for co-op marketing grants.\n\nLater, she asked people to speak with their congressional representative about\nPaycheck Protection Program eligibility and to sign a letter of support for\nthe Local Chamber, Tourism, and 501(C)(6) Protection Act of 2020.\n\n\"This bill would allow all types of destination marketing organizations -\nincluding both 501(C)(6) and quasi-governmental entities with less than 300\nemployees - eligibility into the Paycheck Protection Program,\" she said.\n\nThe Capitol Report is written by editorial staff at\n[WisPolitics.com](http://WisPolitics.com), a nonpartisan, Madison-based news\nservice that specializes in coverage of government and politics, and is\ndistributed for publication by members of the Wisconsin Newspaper Association.",

A patchwork of local rules and lingering reluctance to embrace usual activities could put a damper on things.</p>\n\n<p>Even before the latest development, the city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location> has pegged its losses at <money>$47 million</money> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.dane\">Dane County</location> at <money>$32.5 million</money> due to event cancellations. Meanwhile, the <org>U.S. Travel Association</org> reported <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> is losing millions of dollars every week of the pandemic. The year-over-year net change in weekly travel spending for the week of <chron>March 7</chron> was a deficit of <money>$11 million</money> and for the week <chron>April 25</chron> it skyrocketed to a <money>$218 million</money> loss.</p>\n\n<p><org>Wisconsin Department of Tourism</org> Secretary <person>Sara Meaney</person> said the economic impact of 2019 was \"a record setting year, and the largest year for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> in at least a decade\" and higher than the national average.</p>\n\n<p>The year's numbers came in at about <money>$22.2 billion</money> in total tourism business sales. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin's</location> 113 million visitors alone spent <money>$13.7 billion</money>, supporting more than 202,000 full- and part-time jobs.</p>\n\n<p>But that all changed with the coronavirus hit.</p>\n\n<p>\"We need financial help before more people are laid off so that we can make the appropriate shifts to our marketing strategies, our event planning and our advertising buys,\" said Meaney. \"We need relief now so we are ready to go the second we get the green light from public health officials.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Rob Gard</person>, director of public relations and communications for Destination Madison, says the community will continue to follow the guidelines set out by Gov. <person>Tony Evers</person> as both <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.madisn\">Madison</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.dane\">Dane County</location> had similar orders in place.</p>\n\n<p>\"Consequently, we don't anticipate notable tourism activity for <chron>Memorial Day</chron> weekend,\" Gard said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Leah Hauck</person>, communications manager for the <org>Wisconsin Dells Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau</org>, says the group had \"no way of knowing what to expect\" for <chron>Memorial Day</chron> and \"wouldn't want to speculate.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"<org>The Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau</org> is waiting for further direction and guidance from county and local health officials,\" she said in an email. \"It is imperative that we, as a destination, all do our part to open and run businesses safely and responsibly.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>The U.S. Travel Association</org> expects downturns in the national travel industry as a result of coronavirus will contribute to the national economy entering a recession. The organization argues that a recession could result from travel losses alone and last at least two quarters with the lowest point in the second quarter of 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The association also predicts an 81 percent drop in revenue over the next two months and continued losses over the rest of the year reaching <money>$519 billion</money>. In the week ending <chron>April 25</chron>, the travel economy fell 89 percent below last year's levels; national weekly travel spending is at a new low of <money>$2.3 billion</money>.</p>\n\n<p>The group says \"it remains to be seen how responsive travel spending will be in states that are easing their lockdown measures in the coming weeks.\"</p>\n\n<p>Last year, outdoor recreation was the top marketable driver of visits to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> - about <money>$17.9 billion</money> in consumer spending and 168,000 jobs. Twenty-seven percent of visitor spending was for lodging, followed by food and beverage (26), retail (20), recreation (14) and transportation (13).</p>\n\n<p>And one of those outdoor recreation spaces equipped with lodging, food and retail is the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wislls\">Wisconsin Dells</location> area, which is expecting a \"detrimental\" loss this year due to coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, the spring and summer seasons accounted for 66 percent of direct visitor spending in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wislls\">Wisconsin Dells</location>, income crucial to many businesses and employees, according to <org>Wisconsin Dells Visitor and Convention Bureau</org> President and CEO <person>Romy Snyder</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It will take time to correctly analyze and know the true financial impact of COVID-19 on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wislls\">Wisconsin Dells</location>, but we do know the loss will be detrimental to the local tourism economy,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>While <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.lakeva\">Lake Geneva</location> has had a \"very strong\" January and February with a successful Winterfest and National Snow Sculpting Championship event, <person>Stephanie Klett</person>, the former state tourism secretary and president and CEO of VISIT <location>Lake Geneva</location>, said that \"like the whole country, (quarter two) was like a bomb going off.\"</p>\n\n<p>While Klett couldn't predict exact losses, she said most people have moved their summer business to fall such as weddings, family reunions, meetings and conventions.</p>\n\n<p>\"Fall is becoming the new summer, and we are hoping to make up for lost time,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>And Klett is convinced that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.lakeva\">Lake Geneva</location> is positioned well for recovery because of its location between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location>, a spot that \"gives us access to millions of potential visitors\" because of the drivable distance.</p>\n\n<p>According to Klett, 75 percent of Americans don't want to fly at this time, \"they feel safer in their own car, and within a couple hours of home.\"</p>\n\n<p>And since physical distancing has become important to consumers, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.lakeva\">Lake Geneva's</location> outdoor recreation opportunities and nearby state parks give \"room to roam.\"</p>\n\n<p>While VISIT <location>Lake Geneva</location> is focusing on preparing the region from a marketing standpoint to reopen, Klett is asking the state to set aside politics and let everyone be a part of the solution.</p>\n\n<p>\"Character is revealed through crisis, and there is no time for partisan politics,\" she said. \"People are dying and businesses are fighting for their financial lives. Please provide accurate information and a solid plan for re-opening that is neither overly-generalized or vague.\"</p>\n\n<p>As smaller tourism agencies look to the state for leadership, Meaney is asking for help in return to lobby on her behalf to make sure the tourism industry is included in any COVID-19 relief money.</p>\n\n<p>In early April, Meaney briefed more than 130 Wisconsin state legislators and their staff about COVID-19's toll on the tourism industry and how lawmakers could help it lead the economic recovery. In a newsletter to businesses, she encouraged people to talk to their elected leaders about two proposals for \"the kinds of action we need\": <money>$2 million</money> for a regional destination marketing organization grant program; and <money>$3 million</money> for co-op marketing grants.</p>\n\n<p>Later, she asked people to speak with their congressional representative about Paycheck Protection Program eligibility and to sign a letter of support for the Local Chamber, Tourism, and 501&#169;(6) Protection Act of 2020.</p>\n\n<p>\"This bill would allow all types of destination marketing organizations - including both 501&#169;(6) and quasi-governmental entities with less than 300 employees - eligibility into the Paycheck Protection Program,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>The Capitol Report is written by editorial staff at <a href=\"http://WisPolitics.com\">WisPolitics.com</a>, a nonpartisan, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.madisn\">Madison</location>-based news service that specializes in coverage of government and politics, and is distributed for publication by members of the <org>Wisconsin Newspaper Association</org>.</p>",
