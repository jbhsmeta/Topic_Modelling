(See\ntable 1 and chart 2.) The most populated metropolitan area in the country--New\nYork\\--had the highest number of workplace fatalities (209) in 2018. The\nsmallest of the 10 metropolitan areas--Boston\\--had the lowest fatality count\nwith 60 deaths.\n\n* Type of incident\n\nIn the Philadelphia metropolitan area, transportation incidents resulted in 21\nfatal work injuries, followed by contact with objects and equipment which\naccounted for 17 fatalities 2018.

The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI),\npart of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Safety and Health\nStatistics (OSHS) program, compiles a count of all fatal work injuries\noccurring in the U.S. during the calendar year. The CFOI program uses diverse\nstate, federal, and independent data sources to identify, verify, and describe\nfatal work injuries. This ensures counts are as complete and accurate as\npossible. For the 2017 national data, over 23,400 unique source documents were\nreviewed as part of the data collection process. For technical information and\ndefinitions for CFOI, please go to the BLS Handbook of Methods on the BLS\nwebsite at\n[www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/home.htm](http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/home.htm).\n\nFederal/State agency coverage. The CFOI includes data for all fatal work\ninjuries, even those that may be outside the scope of other agencies or\nregulatory coverage. Thus, any comparison between the BLS fatality census\ncounts and those released by other agencies should take into account the\ndifferent coverage requirements and definitions being used by each agency.\nMore on the scope of CFOI can be found at\n[www.bls.gov/iif/cfoiscope.htm](http://www.bls.gov/iif/cfoiscope.htm) and\n[www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/concepts.htm](http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/concepts.htm).\n\nAcknowledgments.

The Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), part of the <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Safety and Health Statistics</org> (OSHS) program, compiles a count of all fatal work injuries occurring in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> during the calendar year. The CFOI program uses diverse state, federal, and independent data sources to identify, verify, and describe fatal work injuries. This ensures counts are as complete and accurate as possible. For the 2017 national data, over 23,400 unique source documents were reviewed as part of the data collection process. For technical information and definitions for CFOI, please go to the BLS Handbook of Methods on the BLS website at <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/home.htm\">www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/home.htm</a>.</p><p>Federal/State agency coverage. The CFOI includes data for all fatal work injuries, even those that may be outside the scope of other agencies or regulatory coverage. Thus, any comparison between the BLS fatality census counts and those released by other agencies should take into account the different coverage requirements and definitions being used by each agency. More on the scope of CFOI can be found at <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/iif/cfoiscope.htm\">www.bls.gov/iif/cfoiscope.htm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/concepts.htm\">www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cfoi/concepts.htm</a>.</p><p>Acknowledgments.
