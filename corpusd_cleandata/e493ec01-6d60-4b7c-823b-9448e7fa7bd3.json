    "text": "Local city and county officials, along with a crowd of residents, gathered in\ndowntown Opelika's courthouse square for a wreath laying memorial for George\nFloyd.\n\nOpelika city councilwoman Patsy Jones organized the event. She wanted to honor\nFloyd's memory, and do to so as a community. Floyd died two weeks ago in\nMinneapolis under the knee of police officer, sparking protests in Lee County\nand the rest of the nation.\n\n\"Our city, as well as all over this nation, have been in a period of\nmourning,\" Jones said. \"But it was important for the public of Lee County to\nsee that all of us in Lee County are wanting to work together to make sure\nwhatever changes that we need to make, that all of us are on one page in doing\nthat.\"\n\nThe small ceremony began with a short procession of city and county personnel\n\u0096 led by Jones and Opelika Mayor Gary Fuller \u0096 to the white column pergola\nnear the courthouse square's fountain. Jones then asked everyone in attendance\nto bow their heads in a moment of reflection for eight minutes and forty-six\nseconds.\n\n\"I think when you're able to be able to talk and when you're able to realize\nwhat has really happened, I think it makes a difference in moving forward,\"\nshe said. \"That was the importance of everyone seeing how long eight minutes\nand forty-six seconds made a difference in George Floyd's life.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers from Opelika, Auburn and the Lee County Sheriff's\noffice were also present. Sergeant Clarence Stewart of the Auburn Police\nDepartment believes that now is a time for self-reflection for everyone.\n\n\"Can we improve? Yes, yes we can. This is a time for everyone to step back and\nsee not only just what police can do or the city can do,\" Stewart said. \"What\ncan you do? What can we do?\"\n\nStewart added that seeing the peaceful protests has been \"a beautiful thing,\"\nbut says that change won't come with if you don't keep it up.\n\n\"You can't come to the table, then leave the table and not do anything after\nthat,\" he said. \"The voice of many is a lot louder than the voice of a few.\"\n\nSarah Gill, owner of Mama Mocha's, also attended the memorial. Right now, she\nsaid, it's \"imperative\" to focus on unity against racism.\n\n\"Also, [it's important] to make their voices known that this needs to stop,\"\nshe said. \"That this is unacceptable, that this is senseless and it's been\ngoing on since Jim Crow and before the 60s in Alabama and we're done.\"",

    "title": "Watch now: Lee County officials gather for Floyd wreath laying",
    "html": "<p>Local city and county officials, along with a crowd of residents, gathered in downtown Opelika's courthouse square for a wreath laying memorial for <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n<p>Opelika city councilwoman <person>Patsy Jones</person> organized the event. She wanted to honor Floyd's memory, and do to so as a community. Floyd died two weeks ago in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> under the knee of police officer, sparking protests in Lee County and the rest of the nation.</p>\n\n<p>\"Our city, as well as all over this nation, have been in a period of mourning,\" Jones said. \"But it was important for the public of Lee County to see that all of us in Lee County are wanting to work together to make sure whatever changes that we need to make, that all of us are on one page in doing that.\"</p>\n\n<p>The small ceremony began with a short procession of city and county personnel &#150; led by Jones and Opelika Mayor <person>Gary Fuller</person> &#150; to the white column pergola near the courthouse square's fountain. Jones then asked everyone in attendance to bow their heads in a moment of reflection for eight minutes and forty-six seconds.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think when you're able to be able to talk and when you're able to realize what has really happened, I think it makes a difference in moving forward,\" she said. \"That was the importance of everyone seeing how long eight minutes and forty-six seconds made a difference in <person>George Floyd's</person> life.\"</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement officers from Opelika, Auburn and the Lee County Sheriff's office were also present. Sergeant <person>Clarence Stewart</person> of the <org>Auburn Police Department</org> believes that now is a time for self-reflection for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>\"Can we improve? Yes, yes we can. This is a time for everyone to step back and see not only just what police can do or the city can do,\" Stewart said. \"What can you do? What can we do?\"</p>\n\n<p>Stewart added that seeing the peaceful protests has been \"a beautiful thing,\" but says that change won't come with if you don't keep it up.</p>\n\n<p>\"You can't come to the table, then leave the table and not do anything after that,\" he said. \"The voice of many is a lot louder than the voice of a few.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Sarah Gill</person>, owner of Mama Mocha's, also attended the memorial. Right now, she said, it's \"imperative\" to focus on unity against racism.</p>\n\n<p>\"Also, [it's important] to make their voices known that this needs to stop,\" she said. \"That this is unacceptable, that this is senseless and it's been going on since Jim Crow and before the 60s in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.al\">Alabama</location> and we're done.\"</p>",
