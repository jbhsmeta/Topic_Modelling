    "text": "UNION COUNTY, N.C. (FOX 46 CHARLOTTE)- Investigators in Union County are\ntrying to figure out if an overnight arson was racially motivated. Charred\npavement was all that remained along Dale Street in Monroe by Friday morning.\n\nInvestigators say three vehicles, including a semi and attached trailer, were\nset on fire. The suspect also tagged the vehicles with \" Black Lives Matter\".\nThe call came in around 11 p.m. Thursday from someone who lived nearby. It\nquickly became apparent the fires were arson.\n\n\"You see the spray painting along the cars and the speed of the which the\nvehicles burned it appears to include some type of flammable liquid,\" said\nTony Underwood from the Union County Sheriff's Department.\n\nInvestigators say a Molotov cocktail was used to start the fires. A nearby\nabandoned grocery store was also spray painted with \"Black Lives Matter\".\n\nInvestigators returned to the shopping center looking for any additional\nevidence including security footage. They say it's common for people from a\nnearby neighborhood to park along the road overnight.\n\nPart of the investigation is trying to determine if this is a crime of\nopportunity, with someone using \"Black Lives Matter\" as a cover-up.\n\n\"At this point anything is possible. We don't have suspects at this point so\nit's too early to say what might be involved,\" said Underwood.\n\nAnyone with information should call the Union County CrimeStoppers at\n704-283-5600.\n\n* Forrest Fenn confirms treasure hidden in the Rocky Mountains has been found\n\n* Q&A: State of Tokyo Olympics 2 1/2 months after postponement\n\n* California woman says rubber bullet fired by police left her blind in one eye, plans to file lawsuit\n\n* Sheriff won't cite N.C. speedway for crowd despite order\n\n* Former NBA All-Star Cliff Robinson wants Portland to apologize for 1997 profiling",

Charred pavement was all that remained along <location>Dale Street</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.monroe\">Monroe</location> by Friday morning.</p>\n<p>Investigators say three vehicles, including a semi and attached trailer, were set on fire. The suspect also tagged the vehicles with \" <org>Black Lives Matter</org>\". The call came in around <chron>11 p.m. Thursday</chron> from someone who lived nearby. It quickly became apparent the fires were arson.</p>\n\n<p>\"You see the spray painting along the cars and the speed of the which the vehicles burned it appears to include some type of flammable liquid,\" said <person>Tony Underwood</person> from the <org>Union County Sheriff's Department</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Investigators say a Molotov cocktail was used to start the fires. A nearby abandoned grocery store was also spray painted with \"Black Lives Matter\".</p>\n\n<p>Investigators returned to the shopping center looking for any additional evidence including security footage. They say it's common for people from a nearby neighborhood to park along the road overnight.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the investigation is trying to determine if this is a crime of opportunity, with someone using \"Black Lives Matter\" as a cover-up.</p>\n\n<p>\"At this point anything is possible. We don't have suspects at this point so it's too early to say what might be involved,\" said Underwood.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone with information should call the Union County CrimeStoppers at 704-283-5600.</p>\n\n<p>* <person>Forrest Fenn</person> confirms treasure hidden in the <location>Rocky Mountains</location> has been found</p>\n\n<p>* Q&amp;A: State of <org>Tokyo Olympics</org> 2 1/2 months after postponement</p>\n\n<p>* <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> woman says rubber bullet fired by police left her blind in one eye, plans to file lawsuit</p>\n\n<p>* Sheriff won't cite N.C. speedway for crowd despite order</p>\n\n<p>* Former NBA All-Star <person>Cliff Robinson</person> wants Portland to apologize for 1997 profiling</p>",
