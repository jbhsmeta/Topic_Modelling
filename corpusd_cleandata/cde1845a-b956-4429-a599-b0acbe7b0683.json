    "text": "PERRY COUNTY \u0096 Nine new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Perry County between\nWednesday and Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 49.\n\nAccording to information from the Perry County Health Department, all five of\nthe new cases are in isolation. Dr. William Marcrum, Perry County health\nofficer, said one of the nine new cases is an inmate at Branchville\nCorrectional Facility (where four staff and eight inmates have previously\ntested positive).\n\nNone are connected to Golden LivingCenters in Tell City and Dr. Marcrum added\nthat those three cases have since tested negative and are believed to be false\npositives, but they're treated as positive just to be safe.\n\n\"The state says if you have a positive test, you are positive,\" Dr. Marcrum\nsaid.\n\nPublic Health Nurse Tara Lucas said the health department is urging local\nresidents to continue to practice good hand hygiene, social distancing and use\nof face masks.\n\n\"Just because we're opening up some doesn't mean that COVID is gone,\" Lucas\nsaid. \"We still need to be aware and cautious.\"\n\nLucas added that a major cause of concern is the possibility that people who\nshould have been self-isolating because of their own exposure might have\nexposed the people who are newly diagnosed. The Indiana State Department of\nHealth surveyed 3,600 Hoosiers and found 45% of them who tested positive for\nactive virus or its antibodies had no symptoms at all. The Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention \u0096 among others \u0096 have confirmed that people can pass\nthe novel coronavirus even without symptoms.\n\n\"If you are ill, please stay home. Do not go to work, to Wal-Mart or anywhere\npublic,\" Lucas said. \"If you are contacted by us because you've been confirmed\nas a close contact of someone who tested positive, you have to stay home.\"\n\nLucas added that the department needs the public to help them prevent the\nvirus from spreading.\n\nIf you've been deemed as a close contact to a known positive and have been put\non isolation, please follow those guidelines. Period,\" Lucas said. \"We need\npeople to work with us. If we've called you and said you're a close contact,\nplease respect that for the common good of the entire county.\"",

Dr. <person>William Marcrum</person>, Perry County health officer, said one of the nine new cases is an inmate at <org>Branchville Correctional Facility</org> (where four staff and eight inmates have previously tested positive).</p>\n\n<p>None are connected to Golden LivingCenters in Tell City and <person>Dr. Marcrum</person> added that those three cases have since tested negative and are believed to be false positives, but they're treated as positive just to be safe.</p>\n\n<p>\"The state says if you have a positive test, you are positive,\" <person>Dr. Marcrum</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>Public Health Nurse <person>Tara Lucas</person> said the health department is urging local residents to continue to practice good hand hygiene, social distancing and use of face masks.</p>\n\n<p>\"Just because we're opening up some doesn't mean that COVID is gone,\" Lucas said. \"We still need to be aware and cautious.\"</p>\n\n<p>Lucas added that a major cause of concern is the possibility that people who should have been self-isolating because of their own exposure might have exposed the people who are newly diagnosed. <org>The Indiana State Department of Health</org> surveyed 3,600 Hoosiers and found 45% of them who tested positive for active virus or its antibodies had no symptoms at all. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</org> &#150; among others &#150; have confirmed that people can pass the novel coronavirus even without symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>\"If you are ill, please stay home. Do not go to work, to Wal-Mart or anywhere public,\" Lucas said. \"If you are contacted by us because you've been confirmed as a close contact of someone who tested positive, you have to stay home.\"</p>\n\n<p>Lucas added that the department needs the public to help them prevent the virus from spreading.</p>\n\n<p>If you've been deemed as a close contact to a known positive and have been put on isolation, please follow those guidelines. Period,\" Lucas said. \"We need people to work with us. If we've called you and said you're a close contact, please respect that for the common good of the entire county.\"</p>",
