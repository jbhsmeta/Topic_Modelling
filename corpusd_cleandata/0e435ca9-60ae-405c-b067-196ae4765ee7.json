    "text": "Washington: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA has\nissued the following order:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 WO\nKAB IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA Jonathan\nMcAllister, Sr., Plaintiff, v. Charles L. Ryan, et al., Defendants. No. CV\n19-00614-PHX-JAT (DMF) ORDER Plaintiff Jonathan McAllister, Sr., who was\nformerly in the custody of the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC), filed\na Second Amended Complaint alleging violations of federal and state law. (Doc.\n8.) Defendants move for summary judgment. (Doc. 45.) Plaintiff was informed of\nhis rights and obligations to respond pursuant to Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d\n952, 962 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (Doc. 47), and he opposes the Motion. (Doc.\n54.) I. Background On screening under 28 U.S.C. SS 1915A(a), the Court\ndetermined that Plaintiff stated federal and state law claims against\nDefendant Ryan in his individual and official capacities regarding ADC\nDirector Ryan's policy allowing the seizure of Veterans' Disability Benefits\nin violation of 38 U.S.C. SS 5301(a) and Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-\n1539(A), and his refusal to return Plaintiff's disability benefits, negligence\nclaims against Defendants Huizar and Valdez for failing to conduct an audit of\nPlaintiffs' inmate account after being informed that deductions violated state\nand federal law and that there were Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56\nFiled 05/26/20 Page 1 of 9 - 2 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 errors in the charges, a claim against Defendant\nRyan in his official capacity for maintaining a policy of removing inmates\nfrom the diet list without notice and without consulting medical staff if an\ninmate fails to attend a meal, and a state-law tort claim against Defendant\nHernandez for charging Plaintiff for a diet card when he was allegedly exempt\nunder state law and for charging Plaintiff for a second diet card when he did\nnot receive one. (Doc. 15.) The Court dismissed the remaining claims and\nDefendants. (Id.) II. Summary Judgment Standard A court must grant summary\njudgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23\n(1986). The movant bears the initial responsibility of presenting the basis\nfor its motion and identifying those portions of the record, together with\naffidavits, if any, that it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. If the movant fails to carry\nits initial burden of production, the nonmovant need not produce anything.\nNissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Co., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03\n(9th Cir. 2000). But if the movant meets its initial responsibility, the\nburden shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate the existence of a factual\ndispute and that the fact in contention is material, i.e., a fact that might\naffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and that the dispute\nis genuine, i.e., the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmovant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248,\n250 (1986); see Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D. Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th\nCir. 1995). The nonmovant need not establish a material issue of fact\nconclusively in its favor, First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391\nU.S. 253, 288-89 (1968); however, it must \"come forward with specific facts\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co.,\nLtd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) (internal citation\nomitted); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). At summary judgment, the judge's\nfunction is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth but to determine\nwhether there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-\nDMF Document 56 Filed 05/26/20 Page 2 of 9 - 3 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 477 U.S. at 249. In its analysis,\nthe court must believe the nonmovant's evidence and draw all inferences in the\nnonmovant's favor. Id. at 255. The court need consider only the cited\nmaterials, but it may consider any other materials in the record. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c)(3). III. Facts1 The ADC provides each inmate with an Inmate Trust\nAccount (ITA), which allows inmates to send and receive money while in the\ncustody of the ADC. (Doc. 46 P 1.) Inmates can spend the money in their ITAs\non a variety of items and services, including, but not limited to, purchases\nfrom the inmate store, legal copies, services, postage, and supplies, which\nare called \"inmate initiated deductions.\" (Id. P 2.) Certain expenditures are\nallowed even if an inmate does not have sufficient funds in his ITA to cover\nthe transaction. (Id. P 3.) Allowable expenditures even when inmates have\ninsufficient funds in their Spendable Account include: legal copies, services,\npostage and supplies, health care fees, inmate legal access to the courts,\nreplacement Inmate Identification Cards, clips or lanyards, re-testing for\nHigh School equivalency, copies of medical records, lost/damaged Inmate\nResource Center/library books, and department-issued clothing. (Id. P 4.) ITAs\nof inmates allowed expenditures when they have insufficient funds in their\nSpendable Account are placed on hold until there are enough funds in the\naccount to cover the charges. (Id. P 5.) If inmates do not repay the ADC for\nholds on inmate-initiated transactions prior to being released, their ITA\nshall remain on hold indefinitely and collection is only attempted if the\ninmate is returned to custody. (Id. PP 7-9.) ADC inmates have the option of\nhaving checks and/or funds from associations like the Administration of\nVeteran Affairs (VA) or the Social Security Administration directly deposited\ninto their ITAs. (Id. P 10.) The ADC requests inmates receiving such benefits\nhave them directly deposited into the ITA so that a special designation can be\nplaced on those funds. (Id. P 11.) This prevents such funds 1 Although the\nCourt provided notice to Plaintiff pursuant to Rand regarding the requirements\nof a response, Plaintiff did not file a controverting statement of facts or\nseparate statement of facts with his Response to Defendants' Motion for\nSummary Judgment. Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed 05/26/20 Page 3\nof 9 - 4 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n26 27 28 from being assigned or seized and provides clarity on the source of\nthe funds. (Id. P 12.) ADC policy is that there are no mandatory deductions on\nfunds received directly from the VA. (Id. P 13.) ADC does not have resources\nto independently verify the source of inmate funds for over 40,000 inmates.\n(Id. P 14.) Plaintiff was in the custody of the ADC from December 2008 to\nApril 2014. (Id. P 15.) During that time, Plaintiff incurred $5,606.99 in\nholds on his ITA. (Id. P 16.) Plaintiff re-entered custody on January 19, 2018\nwith $1,872.39 transferred from his time spent in the custody of the Maricopa\nSheriff's Office (MCSO). (Id. PP 17-18.) ADC suspended the $1,872.39 because\nof the holds of $5,606.99 that remained on Plaintiff's ITA. (Id. P 19.) On\nJanuary 27, 2018, Plaintiff requested that his bank, Arizona Federal Credit\nUnion, issue a cashier's check of $7,000 for Plaintiff to place in his ITA.\n(Id. P 20.) In total, Plaintiff deposited $8,872.39 into his ITA from both his\naccount at MCSO and his cashier's check from his private bank. (Id. P 21.)\nFrom that sum, his prior holds of $5,606.99 were collected along with\nadditional withdrawals he made in 2018 that brought his total withdrawals to\n$6,107.72. (Id. P 22.) Plaintiff started the grievance process regarding these\ntransactions with an informal complaint on January 29, 2018 and indicated that\nbecause the money consisted of VA benefits, it could not be collected. (Id. P\n24.) Correctional Officer (CO) III Cuen responded and informed Plaintiff that\nbecause the money had come from MCSO, inmate banking had deducted money from\nPlaintiff's ITA that he owed from his previous incarceration. (Id. P 25.) On\nFebruary 9, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a formal grievance indicating that the\nmoney was VA benefits and therefore could not be collected. (Id. P 26.)\nAssociate Deputy Warden Pyle responded and informed Plaintiff that monies\ncoming from the MCSO and his private bank would be classified at intake and\nnot as coming from the VA. (Id. P 27.) Pyle also informed Plaintiff that he\nhad the option to have checks from the VA directly posted to his account and\nthat would ensure that no deductions would be taken. (Id. P 28.) Plaintiff has\nnever had the VA directly deposit benefits into his ITA. (Id. P 29.) Plaintiff\nwas released from ADC under community supervision on September 17, 2019. (Id.\nP 30.) Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed 05/26/20 Page 4 of 9 - 5 -\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 IV.\nDiscussion Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as to\nPlaintiff's claims because (1) Plaintiff's negligence claims are barred by\nArizona Revised Statutes section 31-201(F), (2) Plaintiff's official capacity\nclaims are moot because Plaintiff is no longer in custody, (3) Defendants did\nnot violate 38 U.S.C. SS 5301(a) or Arizona Revised Statutes section\n12-1539(A), and (4) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. (Doc. 45.)\nA. Claims relating to Plaintiff's Diet On screening, the Court recognized two\nclaims regarding Plaintiff's diet: an official capacity claim against Ryan\nbased on Plaintiff's allegations that Ryan had a policy of removing inmates\nfrom the diet list without notice and without consulting medical staff if an\ninmate fails to attend a meal, and a state-law tort claim against Defendant\nHernandez for charging Plaintiff for a diet card when he was allegedly exempt\nunder state law and for charging Plaintiff for a second diet card when he did\nnot receive one. 1. The Official Capacity Claim Defendant Shinn, who is the\ncurrent Director of the ADC, was later substituted for Defendant Ryan as to\nthe official capacity claims against Defendant Ryan. Plaintiff's request for\nequitable relief as to these claims is moot because Plaintiff has been\nreleased. \"Once an inmate is removed from the environment in which he is\nsubjected to the challenged policy or practice, absent a claim for damages, he\nno longer has a legally cognizable interest in a judicial decision on the\nmerits of his claim.\" Jones v. Williams, 791 F.3d 1023, 1031 (9th Cir. 2015)\n(quoting Alvarez v. Hill, 667 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2012)). Although there\nis an exception to the mootness doctrine for claims that are capable of\nrepetition, yet evade review, that exception is limited to cases where the\nduration of the challenged action is too short to be fully litigated before it\nceases, and where there is a reasonable expectation that the plaintiff will be\nsubjected to the same action again. Alvarez, 667 F.3d at 1064. The possibility\nthat an inmate may commit another crime and be returned to custody is too\nspeculative a basis on which to conclude that his claims are capable of\nrepetition. Id. at 1064-65. Here, there is no evidence of a non-speculative\nCase 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed 05/26/20 Page 5 of 9 - 6 - 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\nreasonable expectation that Plaintiff will be subjected to the policies\nrelating to Inmate Accounts and diet cards in prison again. Likewise, although\nan exception to mootness has been recognized where a plaintiff is challenging\nongoing policies to which others will continue to be subject, the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals has not extended this exception beyond \"short-lived\npretrial proceedings in criminal prosecutions, where civil class actions would\nnot be conducive to obtaining the relief sought.\" Id. at 1065. 1983 Moreover,\nPlaintiff cannot maintain a claim for damages under SS 1983 against Defendant\nShinn because Shinn, in an official capacity suit for damages, is not a\n\"person\" within the meaning of SS 1983. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27 (1991)\n(\"State officers sued for damages in their official capacity are not 'persons'\nfor purposes of the suit [under SS 1983] because they assume the identity of\nthe government that employs them\" and States are not \"persons\" under SS 1983).\nAccordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Shinn as to\nPlaintiff's SS 1983 claim against him regarding Plaintiff's diet. 2. The\nNegligence Claim Against Hernandez Defendants argue that Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 31-201(F) prohibits Plaintiff's negligence claim against\nHernandez. Arizona Revised Statutes section 31- 201.01(F) provides that \"[a]ny\nand all causes of action which may arise out of tort caused by the director,\nprison officers or employees of the department, within the scope of their\nlegal duty, shall run only against the state.\" Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. SS\n31-201.01(F). There is no dispute that Hernandez was working within the scope\nof legal duty when he allegedly improperly charged Plaintiff $5.00 for a diet\ncard on two occasions. Accordingly, Plaintiff's negligence claim against\nHernandez is barred by Arizona Revised Statutes section 31-201.01(F). Even if\nPlaintiff had named the State as a Defendant to the negligence claim, Arizona\nRevised Statutes section 31-201.01(L) \"limits inmates' tort claims against the\nState to those involving serious physical injury or ones authorized by federal\nstatute.\" Tripati v. State, 16 P.3d 783, 786 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2000); Ariz. Rev.\nStat. SS 31-201.01(L). As such, Plaintiff could not have maintained his\nnegligence claim against Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed 05/26/20\nPage 6 of 9 - 7 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n24 25 26 27 28 the State because he does not allege that he suffered serious\nphysical injury. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of\nDefendants as to Plaintiff's negligence claim against Defendant Hernandez. B.\nPlaintiff's Claims Regarding ITA Deductions Defendants assert that they are\nentitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims regarding ITA deductions\nbecause they did not violate 38 U.S.C. SS 5301 or Arizona Revised Statutes\nsection 12-1539(A). Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. SS 5301, Payments of benefits due or\nto become due under any law administered by the Secretary shall not be\nassignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law, and such\npayments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary shall be exempt from\ntaxation, shall be exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be liable\nto attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process\nwhatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary. 38 U.S.C. SS\n5301. Similarly, Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-1539(A) exempts federal\ndisability benefits awarded to veterans for service-connected disabilities\nfrom claims of creditors and restates that such benefits are not subject to\nattachment, levy, or seizure under any legal or equitable process as provided\nby federal law. Ariz. Rev. Stat. SS 12-1539(A)(1)- (2). . In Nelson v. Heiss,\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that when a prison deducted\nplaintiff's incoming veteran's benefits to pay off holds placed on his ITA,\nthe prison violated 38 U.S.C. SS 5301 because prison officials allowed\nplaintiff to assign his future benefits and then seized those to repay the\nprison system. 271 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir. 2001.) Defendants argue that\nPlaintiff's claim is distinguishable from Nelson because in Nelson, the\nplaintiff's account was funded by payments of Veteran's Disability Benefits\nadministered by the VA, which deposited the funds directly into Plaintiff's\nITA account. Defendants assert that here, despite the ADC's policy of allowing\nVA benefits to be directly deposited into an ITA, Plaintiff chose to withdraw\nfunds from his personal bank Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed\n05/26/20 Page 7 of 9 - 8 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 account and deposit them into his ITA with no\nindication that those funds were Veteran's Benefits. Defendants assert that\nthe ADC's policy of requiring that the VA direct deposit funds into the ITA\nserves the purpose of allowing the prison to put a special designation on\nthose funds to ensure that those funds are not assigned or seized and provides\ncomplete clarity as to the source of funds. The ADC's policy that it does not\nuse money deposited by the VA into a prisoner's account to pay off holds does\nnot violate 38 U.S.C. SS 5301 or Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-1539(A).\nThere is no evidence in the record supporting Plaintiff's official capacity\nclaim against Shinn based on the ADC's policies, practices, or customs\nregarding using VA benefits to pay off holds on ITAs. Further, there is no\nevidence that the ADC or ADC officials knew that Plaintiff was claiming that\nthe money deposited into his ITA was derived from his Veteran's Benefits when\nthe ADC applied the money toward Plaintiff's holds. Plaintiff argues that when\nhe told the ADC that the money was derived from his Veteran's Benefits, they\nshould have immediately reimbursed the money to him. There is no evidence in\nthis record, however, that Plaintiff produced any evidence to the ADC\nsupporting his statement that the money in his ITA was money from the VA.\nIndeed, even in the record before the Court, Plaintiff has not shown that the\nmoney in his ITA consisted of his VA benefits. Plaintiff produces evidence in\nthe form of bank statements between December 1, 2016 and November 1, 2017 that\nthe VA deposited monthly benefits of $1,776.00 into his Arizona Federal Credit\nUnion account. (Doc. 54 at 22-37.) The bank statements also show, however,\nthat this bank account was not solely used for Plaintiff's VA benefits and\nthat deposits from other sources were mixed in with Plaintiff's VA benefits.\n(See id.) As such, even if ADC employees were in possession of Plaintiff's\nArizona Federal Credit Union statements, they would not have been able to\ndiscern which monies subsequently deposited into Plaintiff's ITA originated as\nVA Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed 05/26/20 Page 8 of 9 - 9 - 1 2\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\nbenefits.2 Accordingly, there is no evidence in the record that the ADC's\npolicy regarding Veterans' Disability Benefits and ITA holds violates 38\nU.S.C. SS 5301(a) and Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-1539(A), and there\nis no evidence that Defendants Ryan, Huizar, or Valdez improperly failed to\nreimburse Plaintiff's ITA. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in\nfavor of Defendants as to these claims.3 IT IS ORDERED: (1) The reference to\nthe Magistrate Judge is withdrawn as to Defendants' Motion for Summary\nJudgment (Doc. 45). (2) Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 45) is\ngranted, and the action is terminated with prejudice. The Clerk of Court must\nenter judgment accordingly. Dated this 26th day of May, 2020. 2 Defendants\nalso argue that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. SS 3.665, Plaintiff would have received\nless disability benefits if he had informed the VA of his incarceration, and\nso Plaintiff chose not to have his Veteran's Benefits direct deposited because\nthat would have put the VA on notice that his Veteran's Benefits should be\nreduced. This argument appears to question whether Plaintiff would have\nstanding to recover funds that he was not rightfully entitled to receive if he\nhad informed the VA of his incarceration. Because, as discussed above, the\norigin of the funds in question is based on mere conjecture, the Court cannot\ndetermine whether there is a standing issue on this record. 3 Because the\nCourt finds summary judgment is appropriate, it does not address the remainder\nof Defendants' arguments.

Ryan</person>, et al.,\nDefendants. No. CV 19-00614-PHX-JAT (DMF) ORDER Plaintiff <person>Jonathan\nMcAllister</person>, Sr., who was formerly in the custody of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4082328319\">Arizona\nDepartment of Corrections</org> (ADC), filed a Second Amended Complaint\nalleging violations of federal and state law. (Doc. 8.) Defendants move\nfor summary judgment. (Doc. 45.) Plaintiff was informed of his rights\nand obligations to respond pursuant to Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952,\n962 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (Doc. 47), and he opposes the Motion.\n(Doc. 54.) I. Background On screening under 28 U.S.C. SS 1915A(a), the\nCourt determined that Plaintiff stated federal and state law claims\nagainst Defendant Ryan in his individual and official capacities\nregarding ADC Director Ryan's policy allowing the seizure of\nVeterans' Disability Benefits in violation of 38 U.S.C. SS 5301(a)\nand Arizona Revised Statutes section 12- 1539(A), and his refusal to\nreturn Plaintiff's disability benefits, negligence claims against\nDefendants Huizar and Valdez for failing to conduct an audit of\nPlaintiffs' inmate account after being informed that deductions\nviolated state and federal law and that there were Case\n2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 1 of 9 - 2 - 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\nerrors in the charges, a claim against Defendant Ryan in his official\ncapacity for maintaining a policy of removing inmates from the diet list\nwithout notice and without consulting medical staff if an inmate fails\nto attend a meal, and a state-law tort claim against Defendant Hernandez\nfor charging Plaintiff for a diet card when he was allegedly exempt\nunder state law and for charging Plaintiff for a second diet card when\nhe did not receive one. (Doc. 15.) The Court dismissed the remaining\nclaims and Defendants. (Id.) II. Summary Judgment Standard A court must\ngrant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. <person>R. Civ</person>. P. 56(a); see also\n<org>Celotex Corp.</org> v. Catrett, <location>477 U.S. 317</location>, 322-23 (1986). The movant bears\nthe initial responsibility of presenting the basis for its motion and\nidentifying those portions of the record, together with affidavits, if\nany, that it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4036310804\">Celotex</org>, 477 U.S. at 323. If the movant fails to carry\nits initial burden of production, the nonmovant need not produce\nanything. <person>Nissan Fire</person> &amp; Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1366520374\">Fritz Co., Inc.</org>,\n210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). But if the movant meets its\ninitial responsibility, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to\ndemonstrate the existence of a factual dispute and that the fact in\ncontention is material, i.e., a fact that might affect the outcome of\nthe suit under the governing law, and that the dispute is genuine, i.e.,\nthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for\nthe nonmovant. Anderson v. <org>Liberty Lobby, Inc.</org>, <location>477 U.S. 242</location>, 248, 250\n(1986); see <org>Triton Energy Corp.</org> v. <org>Square D. Co.</org>, 68 F.3d 1216, 1221\n(9th Cir. 1995). The nonmovant need not establish a material issue of\nfact conclusively in its favor, First Nat'l <org>Bank of Ariz</org>. v. Cities\nServ. Co., <location>391 U.S. 253</location>, 288-89 (1968); however, it must \"come\nforward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\ntrial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. <org>Zenith Radio Corp.</org>,\n<location>475 U.S. 574</location>, 587 (1986) (internal citation omitted); see Fed. <person>R. Civ</person>.\nP. 56(c)(1). At summary judgment, the judge's function is not to\nweigh the evidence and determine the truth but to determine whether\nthere is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF\nDocument 56 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 2 of 9 - 3 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 477 U.S. at 249. In its\nanalysis, the court must believe the nonmovant's evidence and draw\nall inferences in the nonmovant's favor. Id. at 255. The court need\nconsider only the cited materials, but it may consider any other\nmaterials in the record. Fed. <person>R. Civ</person>. P. 56(c)(3). III. Facts1 The ADC\nprovides each inmate with an Inmate Trust Account (ITA), which allows\ninmates to send and receive money while in the custody of the ADC. (Doc.\n46 P 1.) Inmates can spend the money in their ITAs on a variety of items\nand services, including, but not limited to, purchases from the inmate\nstore, legal copies, services, postage, and supplies, which are called\n\"inmate initiated deductions.\" (Id. P 2.) Certain expenditures\nare allowed even if an inmate does not have sufficient funds in his ITA\nto cover the transaction. (Id. P 3.) Allowable expenditures even when\ninmates have insufficient funds in their Spendable Account include:\nlegal copies, services, postage and supplies, health care fees, inmate\nlegal access to the courts, replacement Inmate Identification Cards,\nclips or lanyards, re-testing for High School equivalency, copies of\nmedical records, lost/damaged <org>Inmate Resource Center</org>/library books, and\ndepartment-issued clothing. (Id. P 4.) ITAs of inmates allowed\nexpenditures when they have insufficient funds in their Spendable\nAccount are placed on hold until there are enough funds in the account\nto cover the charges. (Id. P 5.) If inmates do not repay the ADC for\nholds on inmate-initiated transactions prior to being released, their\nITA shall remain on hold indefinitely and collection is only attempted\nif the inmate is returned to custody. (Id. PP 7-9.) ADC inmates have the\noption of having checks and/or funds from associations like the\n<org>Administration of Veteran Affairs</org> (VA) or the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1080606992\">Social Security\nAdministration</org> directly deposited into their ITAs. (Id. P 10.) The ADC\nrequests inmates receiving such benefits have them directly deposited\ninto the ITA so that a special designation can be placed on those funds.\n(Id. P 11.) This prevents such funds 1 Although the Court provided\nnotice to Plaintiff pursuant to Rand regarding the requirements of a\nresponse, Plaintiff did not file a controverting statement of facts or\nseparate statement of facts with his Response to Defendants' Motion\nfor Summary Judgment.

(Id. P 12.) ADC policy is that there\nare no mandatory deductions on funds received directly from the <org>VA</org>. (Id.\nP 13.) ADC does not have resources to independently verify the source of\ninmate funds for over 40,000 inmates. (Id. P 14.) Plaintiff was in the\ncustody of the ADC from <chron>December 2008</chron> to <chron>April 2014</chron>. (Id. P 15.) During\nthat time, Plaintiff incurred <money>$5,606.99</money> in holds on his ITA. (Id. P 16.)\nPlaintiff re-entered custody on <chron>January 19, 2018</chron> with <money>$1,872.39</money>\ntransferred from his time spent in the custody of the <org>Maricopa\nSheriff's Office</org> (MCSO). (Id. PP 17-18.) ADC suspended the\n<money>$1,872.39</money> because of the holds of <money>$5,606.99</money> that remained on\nPlaintiff's ITA. (Id. P 19.) On <chron>January 27, 2018</chron>, Plaintiff\nrequested that his bank, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3154697474\">Arizona Federal Credit Union</org>, issue a\ncashier's check of <money>$7,000</money> for Plaintiff to place in his ITA. (Id. P\n20.) In total, Plaintiff deposited <money>$8,872.39</money> into his ITA from both his\naccount at MCSO and his cashier's check from his private bank. (Id.\nP 21.) From that sum, his prior holds of <money>$5,606.99</money> were collected along\nwith additional withdrawals he made in 2018 that brought his total\nwithdrawals to <money>$6,107.72</money>. (Id. P 22.) Plaintiff started the grievance\nprocess regarding these transactions with an informal complaint on\n<chron>January 29, 2018</chron> and indicated that because the money consisted of <org>VA</org>\nbenefits, it could not be collected. (Id. P 24.) Correctional Officer\n(CO) III Cuen responded and informed Plaintiff that because the money\nhad come from MCSO, inmate banking had deducted money from\nPlaintiff's ITA that he owed from his previous incarceration. (Id.\nP 25.) On <chron>February 9, 2018</chron>, Plaintiff submitted a formal grievance\nindicating that the money was <org>VA</org> benefits and therefore could not be\ncollected. (Id. P 26.) Associate Deputy Warden Pyle responded and\ninformed Plaintiff that monies coming from the MCSO and his private bank\nwould be classified at intake and not as coming from the <org>VA</org>. (Id. P 27.)\nPyle also informed Plaintiff that he had the option to have checks from\nthe <org>VA</org> directly posted to his account and that would ensure that no\ndeductions would be taken. (Id. P 28.) Plaintiff has never had the <org>VA</org>\ndirectly deposit benefits into his ITA. (Id. P 29.) Plaintiff was\nreleased from ADC under community supervision on <chron>September 17, 2019</chron>.\n(Id.

Discussion Defendants argue that they are entitled to\nsummary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims because (1)\nPlaintiff's negligence claims are barred by Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 31-201(F), (2) Plaintiff's official capacity\nclaims are moot because Plaintiff is no longer in custody, (3)\nDefendants did not violate 38 U.S.C. SS 5301(a) or Arizona Revised\nStatutes section 12-1539(A), and (4) Defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity. (Doc. 45.) A. Claims relating to Plaintiff's\nDiet On screening, the Court recognized two claims regarding\nPlaintiff's diet: an official capacity claim against Ryan based on\nPlaintiff's allegations that Ryan had a policy of removing inmates\nfrom the diet list without notice and without consulting medical staff\nif an inmate fails to attend a meal, and a state-law tort claim against\nDefendant Hernandez for charging Plaintiff for a diet card when he was\nallegedly exempt under state law and for charging Plaintiff for a second\ndiet card when he did not receive one. 1. The Official Capacity Claim\nDefendant Shinn, who is the current Director of the ADC, was later\nsubstituted for Defendant Ryan as to the official capacity claims\nagainst Defendant Ryan. Plaintiff's request for equitable relief as\nto these claims is moot because Plaintiff has been released. \"Once\nan inmate is removed from the environment in which he is subjected to\nthe challenged policy or practice, absent a claim for damages, he no\nlonger has a legally cognizable interest in a judicial decision on the\nmerits of his claim.\" Jones v. Williams, 791 F.3d 1023, 1031 (9th\nCir. 2015) (quoting Alvarez v. Hill, 667 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.\n2012)). Although there is an exception to the mootness doctrine for\nclaims that are capable of repetition, yet evade review, that exception\nis limited to cases where the duration of the challenged action is too\nshort to be fully litigated before it ceases, and where there is a\nreasonable expectation that the plaintiff will be subjected to the same\naction again. Alvarez, 667 F.3d at 1064. The possibility that an inmate\nmay commit another crime and be returned to custody is too speculative a\nbasis on which to conclude that his claims are capable of repetition.\nId. at 1064-65. Here, there is no evidence of a non-speculative Case\n2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 5 of 9 - 6 - 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\nreasonable expectation that Plaintiff will be subjected to the policies\nrelating to Inmate Accounts and diet cards in prison again. Likewise,\nalthough an exception to mootness has been recognized where a plaintiff\nis challenging ongoing policies to which others will continue to be\nsubject, the <org>Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</org> has not extended this\nexception beyond \"short-lived pretrial proceedings in criminal\nprosecutions, where civil class actions would not be conducive to\nobtaining the relief sought.\" Id. at 1065. 1983 Moreover, Plaintiff\ncannot maintain a claim for damages under SS 1983 against Defendant\nShinn because Shinn, in an official capacity suit for damages, is not a\n\"person\" within the meaning of SS 1983. Hafer v. Melo, <location>502\nU.S. 21</location>, 27 (1991) (\"State officers sued for damages in their\nofficial capacity are not 'persons' for purposes of the suit\n[under SS 1983] because they assume the identity of the government that\nemploys them\" and States are not \"persons\" under SS\n1983). Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Shinn\nas to Plaintiff's SS 1983 claim against him regarding\nPlaintiff's diet. 2. The Negligence Claim Against Hernandez\nDefendants argue that Arizona Revised Statutes section 31-201(F)\nprohibits Plaintiff's negligence claim against Hernandez. Arizona\nRevised Statutes section 31- 201.01(F) provides that \"[a]ny and all\ncauses of action which may arise out of tort caused by the director,\nprison officers or employees of the department, within the scope of\ntheir legal duty, shall run only against the state.\" Ariz. <person>Rev.\nStat</person>. Ann. SS 31-201.01(F). There is no dispute that Hernandez was\nworking within the scope of legal duty when he allegedly improperly\ncharged Plaintiff <money>$5.00</money> for a diet card on two occasions. Accordingly,\nPlaintiff's negligence claim against Hernandez is barred by Arizona\nRevised Statutes section 31-201.01(F). Even if Plaintiff had named the\nState as a Defendant to the negligence claim, Arizona Revised Statutes\nsection 31-201.01(L) \"limits inmates' tort claims against the\nState to those involving serious physical injury or ones authorized by\nfederal statute.\" Tripati v. State, 16 P.3d 783, 786 (Ariz. Ct.\nApp. 2000); Ariz. <person>Rev. Stat</person>. SS 31-201.01(L). As such, Plaintiff could\nnot have maintained his negligence claim against Case\n2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 6 of 9 - 7 - 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 the\nState because he does not allege that he suffered serious physical\ninjury. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of\nDefendants as to Plaintiff's negligence claim against Defendant\nHernandez. B. Plaintiff's Claims Regarding ITA Deductions\nDefendants assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on\nPlaintiff's claims regarding ITA deductions because they did not\nviolate 38 U.S.C. SS 5301 or Arizona Revised Statutes section\n12-1539(A). Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. SS 5301, Payments of benefits due or\nto become due under any law administered by the Secretary shall not be\nassignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law, and such\npayments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary shall be exempt from\ntaxation, shall be exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be\nliable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or\nequitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the\nbeneficiary. 38 U.S.C. SS 5301. Similarly, Arizona Revised Statutes\nsection 12-1539(A) exempts federal disability benefits awarded to\nveterans for service-connected disabilities from claims of creditors and\nrestates that such benefits are not subject to attachment, levy, or\nseizure under any legal or equitable process as provided by federal law.\nAriz. <person>Rev. Stat</person>. SS 12-1539(A)(1)- (2). . In Nelson v. Heiss, the <org>Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals</org> held that when a prison deducted\nplaintiff's incoming veteran's benefits to pay off holds\nplaced on his ITA, the prison violated 38 U.S.C. SS 5301 because prison\nofficials allowed plaintiff to assign his future benefits and then\nseized those to repay the prison system. 271 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir.\n2001.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claim is distinguishable\nfrom Nelson because in Nelson, the plaintiff's account was funded\nby payments of Veteran's Disability Benefits administered by the\n<org>VA</org>, which deposited the funds directly into Plaintiff's ITA\naccount. Defendants assert that here, despite the ADC's policy of\nallowing <org>VA</org> benefits to be directly deposited into an ITA, Plaintiff\nchose to withdraw funds from his personal bank Case\n2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF Document 56 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 7 of 9 - 8 - 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\naccount and deposit them into his ITA with no indication that those\nfunds were Veteran's Benefits. Defendants assert that the\nADC's policy of requiring that the <org>VA</org> direct deposit funds into the\nITA serves the purpose of allowing the prison to put a special\ndesignation on those funds to ensure that those funds are not assigned\nor seized and provides complete clarity as to the source of funds. The\nADC's policy that it does not use money deposited by the <org>VA</org> into a\nprisoner's account to pay off holds does not violate 38 U.S.C. SS\n5301 or Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-1539(A). There is no\nevidence in the record supporting Plaintiff's official capacity\nclaim against Shinn based on the ADC's policies, practices, or\ncustoms regarding using <org>VA</org> benefits to pay off holds on ITAs. Further,\nthere is no evidence that the ADC or ADC officials knew that Plaintiff\nwas claiming that the money deposited into his ITA was derived from his\nVeteran's Benefits when the ADC applied the money toward\nPlaintiff's holds. Plaintiff argues that when he told the ADC that\nthe money was derived from his Veteran's Benefits, they should have\nimmediately reimbursed the money to him. There is no evidence in this\nrecord, however, that Plaintiff produced any evidence to the ADC\nsupporting his statement that the money in his ITA was money from the\n<org>VA</org>. Indeed, even in the record before the Court, Plaintiff has not shown\nthat the money in his ITA consisted of his <org>VA</org> benefits. Plaintiff\nproduces evidence in the form of bank statements between <chron>December 1,\n2016</chron> and <chron>November 1, 2017</chron> that the <org>VA</org> deposited monthly benefits of\n<money>$1,776.00</money> into his <org>Arizona Federal Credit Union</org> account. (Doc. 54 at\n22-37.) The bank statements also show, however, that this bank account\nwas not solely used for Plaintiff's <org>VA</org> benefits and that deposits\nfrom other sources were mixed in with Plaintiff's <org>VA</org> benefits. (See\nid.) As such, even if ADC employees were in possession of\nPlaintiff's <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3154697474\">Arizona Federal Credit Union</org> statements, they would not\nhave been able to discern which monies subsequently deposited into\nPlaintiff's ITA originated as VA Case 2:19-cv-00614-JAT-DMF\nDocument 56 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 8 of 9 - 9 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 benefits.2 Accordingly,\nthere is no evidence in the record that the ADC's policy regarding\nVeterans' Disability Benefits and ITA holds violates 38 U.S.C. SS\n5301(a) and Arizona Revised Statutes section 12-1539(A), and there is no\nevidence that Defendants Ryan, Huizar, or Valdez improperly failed to\nreimburse Plaintiff's ITA. Accordingly, summary judgment will be\ngranted in favor of Defendants as to these claims.3 IT IS ORDERED: (1)\nThe reference to the Magistrate Judge is withdrawn as to\nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 45). (2)\nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 45) is granted, and\nthe action is terminated with prejudice. The Clerk of Court must enter\njudgment accordingly. Dated this 26th day of May, 2020. 2 Defendants\nalso argue that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. SS 3.665, Plaintiff would have\nreceived less disability benefits if he had informed the <org>VA</org> of his\nincarceration, and so Plaintiff chose not to have his Veteran's\nBenefits direct deposited because that would have put the <org>VA</org> on notice\nthat his Veteran's Benefits should be reduced. This argument\nappears to question whether Plaintiff would have standing to recover\nfunds that he was not rightfully entitled to receive if he had informed\nthe <org>VA</org> of his incarceration. Because, as discussed above, the origin of\nthe funds in question is based on mere conjecture, the Court cannot\ndetermine whether there is a standing issue on this record. 3 Because\nthe Court finds summary judgment is appropriate, it does not address the\nremainder of Defendants' arguments.
