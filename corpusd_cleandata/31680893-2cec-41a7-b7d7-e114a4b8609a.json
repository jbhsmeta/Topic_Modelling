    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Politics, Law\n& Government Daily \\-- Research findings on International Development are\ndiscussed in a new report. According to news reporting originating from\nSylhet, Bangladesh, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This paper\nexamines microfinance conditionalities of the Bangladesh Rural Development\nBoard in Bangladesh from clients' and providers' perspectives based on a\nqualitative case study. The study reveals that the credit is less poor focus\nin terms of amount and disbursement procedure.\"\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Shahjalal\nUniversity of Science and Technology, \"Additionally, group liability and\ncooperatives are used as tactics for surveillance and punishment instead of\ninvigorating collective effort. Saving and share work as disciplinary\ninstruments instead of capital accumulation. Besides, service is regarded as a\nconditional commodity, and skill development becomes individual\nresponsibility.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study implies\nlistening to the voice of the poor and redesigning antipoverty programmes\nbased on the need felt by them.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Conditionalities of Public\nMicrofinance and the Rural Poor: Voices From the Below. _Journal of\nInternational Development_ , 2020;32(4):526-542. _Journal of International\nDevelopment_ can be contacted at: Wiley, 111 River St, Hoboken 07030-5774, NJ,\nUSA.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at Politics, <org>Law &amp; Government Daily</org> -- Research findings on International Development are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting originating from Sylhet, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/bd\">Bangladesh</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;This paper examines microfinance conditionalities of the <org>Bangladesh Rural Development Board</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/bd\">Bangladesh</location> from clients&#8217; and providers&#8217; perspectives based on a qualitative case study. The study reveals that the credit is less poor focus in terms of amount and disbursement procedure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the <org>Shahjalal University</org> of Science and Technology, &#8220;Additionally, group liability and cooperatives are used as tactics for surveillance and punishment instead of invigorating collective effort. Saving and share work as disciplinary instruments instead of capital accumulation. Besides, service is regarded as a conditional commodity, and skill development becomes individual responsibility.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;The study implies listening to the voice of the poor and redesigning antipoverty programmes based on the need felt by them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Conditionalities of Public Microfinance and the Rural Poor: Voices From the Below. <em><org>Journal of International Development</org></em>, 2020;32(4):526-542. <em><org>Journal of International Development</org></em> can be contacted at: Wiley, <location>111 River St</location>, Hoboken 07030-5774, NJ, USA.
