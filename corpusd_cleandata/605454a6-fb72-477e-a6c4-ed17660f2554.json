    "text": "Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said on Friday that 's effort to suppress\nCOVID-19 could be set back by the planned rally which is expected to attract\ntens of thousands of people.But representatives of the group Warriors of the\nAboriginal Resistance, who have organised the demonstration to highlight\nAboriginal deaths in custody and the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd at\nthe hands of police, have vowed to continue while urging protesters to take\nprecautions.At a press conference on Friday afternoon Meriki Onus from WAR\nurged those attending the event on Saturday to bring masks and said community\nsafety was \"paramount\".\"Do not protest in groups of more than 20 and within\nyour group of 20 you are to remain 1.5 metres apart and ensure there is\ndistance between each group of 20,\" she said.She also urged attendees to bring\nhand sanitiser and use it regularly.\"This is a global and historic movement, a\nproduct of hundreds of years of systemic racism and policing that the state\nhas contributed to. Every time we rally, the state and police attempt to stop\nus by force,\" she said.\"Police in South Australia have acknowledged that this\nmust go ahead and are working with organisers to ensure safety for people\nattending. This is what we are asking.\"Governments and police are trying to\ndeflect from their failures and responsibility. Since 1992, 432 Aboriginal\npeople have died in custody with countless more before then. No-one has never\nbeen convicted for their deaths.\"Protest is not a choice when so many of our\npeople are murdered at the hands of police and prison guards. We stress that\nthe safety of our community is paramount.\"The organisers then read out a list\nof 12 demands, which included the dismantling of the police and justice\nsystem, an end to \"police brutality and racist policing practices\", and the\nreopening of inquests and cases of Aboriginal deaths in custody to be overseen\nby independent bodies.Police are resigned to not being able to fine everyone\nwho turns up given the impracticality of doing so. However, they would fine\nsome organisers and may send infringement notices to people after the event,\nMr Patton said.\"We don't want it to happen,\" he said.LoadingReplay\"We don't\nwant to be applying any use of force whatsoever \u2026 we don't even want this to\ngo ahead, but if it does we will try and have a peaceful [event], but people\nhave to be accountable for their actions.\"If it goes ahead we'll probably have\nto apply a lot of discretion because you can't practically issue thousands and\nthousands of infringements.\"Mr Patton said if the protest became unruly and if\npolice were physically confronted by protesters, they would arrest attendees.\nPolice could issue a declaration to perform searches on protesters if\nnecessary, he said.\"We will do what we can,\" he said. \"My message is 'don't\ngo', it will be illegal because of the Chief Health Officer's directions.\"Do\nit online, do it at home, post something in solidarity online.\"A statement\nissued by Police on Friday afternoon reinforced Mr Patton's message: \"There\nare obvious and potentially dire public health consequences should this event\nlead to an outbreak of coronavirus.\" Police statementClaims in the media this\nweek that Police will not be issuing infringement notices to people who breach\nChief Health Officer directions at tomorrow's planned protest in the CBD are\nwrong. In the exercise of police discretion, those who intentionally break the\nlaw will be held to account, and we have again contacted the organisers of the\nprotest this morning to ensure this point is understood.As Assistant\nCommissioner Luke Cornelius made clear earlier this week, it is our strong\npreference that the protest does not occur at this time, while the\nrestrictions in relation to public gatherings remain in place.If it is to\nproceed then it must be conducted in a manner which does not breach the Chief\nHealth Officer directions.We have also been clear that it would not be\npractical to issue infringements to thousands of persons congregating for a\nprotest. We wish to keep the protest a peaceful one.That said, after the event\nand as per other recent protests, we will assess the evidence of the protest\nand if it did breach CHO guidelines we will not hesitate to issue infringement\nnotices to the organisers. We will also consider other persons whom it may be\nappropriate to infringe.Meanwhile, Police are taking the organisers ofSydney's\nsimultaneous protest to the Supreme Court Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it\n\"never was and never will be\" the state's intention to allow thousands of\npeople to be \"flagrantly disregarding the [state's] health orders\".Prime\nMinister Scott Morrison also urged people not to attend protests which are\nplanned to take place across the country.\"Our message is very clear,\" Mr\nMorrison said. \"The health risks and the risks of people coming into close\nproximity are real, and Australians have worked incredibly hard in recent\nmonths and undergone great sacrifices to protect the health of the most\nvulnerable, and that has included our Indigenous communities.\"Gatherings of\nmore than 20 people are not permitted under 's current regulations but more\nthan 30,000 people have indicated they will attend or are interested in this\nweekend's march against police brutality.A rally in London last\nweekend.Credit:Organisers have asked people to wear masks, bring hand\nsanitiser and self-isolate afterwards if they can, but Dr Sutton said now was\nnot the time to hold a protest.\"There is a risk that all of the gains that we\nhave made are put at risk by people gathering in large numbers,\" he said.\"It\ntakes a single individual who is infectious to potentially transmit to many\nothers in a mass gathering setting.\"I am advising people not to attend. There\nare other ways to protest.\"Dr Sutton said anyone who ignores advice to not\nattend should stay 1.5 metres apart and wear a mask if they can.However, he\nsaid this would be difficult when people are protesting loudly.\"That's what\nprotests do so that adds to my concern about the risk of transmission,\" he\nsaid.Premier Daniel Andrews has one clear message to protesters: \"Don't go\"\nand find a safer way to make the same point.\"We are in the middle of a global\npandemic. This is serious,\" Mr Andrews said.\"We don't want all the hard work,\nall the sacrifice that ns have made, frittered away by people gathering to\nmake an important point, but it is not the only way to make that point.\"There\nwere three new COVID-19 cases in recorded overnight, taking the total number\nof people who have had the virus to 1681. There are currently 74 active cases\nin the state.Of the new cases, two were returned travellers in hotel\nquarantine and one was a prep student from Newbury Primary School in\nCraigieburn.The student had no symptoms last week and developed symptoms over\nthe weekend.The school is closed for cleaning and will reopen next week.Mr\nMorrison said one of the government's biggest worries at the start of the\ncoronavirus outbreak was the potential impact on Indigenous communities.\"This\nisn't about people's ability to express themselves and engage in protest\nactivity, we all respect that,\" he said.But Mr Morrison urged protesters to\nfind another way to express their views without putting their health and that\nof others at risk, along with \"the great gains we have been able to make as a\ncountry in recent months\".\"I encourage people not to attend for those reasons\nand those reasons only,\" he said.The Australian Health Protection Principal\nCommittee, made up of federal, state and territory chief health officers,\nreleased a statement after its meeting on Friday afternoon stating that the\nexpert body \"is extremely concerned about proposed large gatherings for\nprotests over the coming weekend and beyond\".\"Australians are reminded that in\nour recent past a single person infected more than 35 others,\" the statement\nsaid.\"This virus is very, very infectious.\"Sign up to our Coronavirus Update\nnewsletterGet our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial\ndevelopments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers\nare saying.

    "html": "<p>Chief Health Officer <person>Brett Sutton</person> said on Friday that 's effort to suppress COVID-19 could be set back by the planned rally which is expected to attract tens of thousands of people.But representatives of the group Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, who have organised the demonstration to highlight Aboriginal deaths in custody and the death of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> man <person>George Floyd</person> at the hands of police, have vowed to continue while urging protesters to take precautions.At a press conference on Friday afternoon Meriki Onus from WAR urged those attending the event on Saturday to bring masks and said community safety was &#8220;paramount&#8221;.&#8220;Do not protest in groups of more than 20 and within your group of 20 you are to remain 1.5 metres apart and ensure there is distance between each group of 20,&#8221; she said.She also urged attendees to bring hand sanitiser and use it regularly.&#8220;This is a global and historic movement, a product of hundreds of years of systemic racism and policing that the state has contributed to. Every time we rally, the state and police attempt to stop us by force,&#8221; she said.&#8220;Police in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..soaust\">South Australia</location> have acknowledged that this must go ahead and are working with organisers to ensure safety for people attending. This is what we are asking.&#8220;Governments and police are trying to deflect from their failures and responsibility. Since 1992, 432 Aboriginal people have died in custody with countless more before then. No-one has never been convicted for their deaths.&#8220;Protest is not a choice when so many of our people are murdered at the hands of police and prison guards. We stress that the safety of our community is paramount.&#8221;The organisers then read out a list of 12 demands, which included the dismantling of the police and justice system, an end to &#8220;police brutality and racist policing practices&#8221;, and the reopening of inquests and cases of Aboriginal deaths in custody to be overseen by independent bodies.Police are resigned to not being able to fine everyone who turns up given the impracticality of doing so. However, they would fine some organisers and may send infringement notices to people after the event, <person>Mr Patton</person> said.\"We don&#8217;t want it to happen,\" he said.LoadingReplay\"We don&#8217;t want to be applying any use of force whatsoever &#8230; we don&#8217;t even want this to go ahead, but if it does we will try and have a peaceful [event], but people have to be accountable for their actions.\"If it goes ahead we'll probably have to apply a lot of discretion because you can't practically issue thousands and thousands of infringements.\"<person>Mr Patton</person> said if the protest became unruly and if police were physically confronted by protesters, they would arrest attendees. Police could issue a declaration to perform searches on protesters if necessary, he said.\"We will do what we can,\" he said. \"My message is 'don&#8217;t go', it will be illegal because of the Chief Health Officer&#8217;s directions.\"Do it online, do it at home, post something in solidarity online.\"A statement issued by  Police on Friday afternoon reinforced <person>Mr Patton's</person> message: \"There are obvious and potentially dire public health consequences should this event lead to an outbreak of coronavirus.\" Police statementClaims in the media this week that  Police will not be issuing infringement notices to people who breach Chief Health Officer directions at tomorrow&#8217;s planned protest in the CBD are wrong. In the exercise of police discretion, those who intentionally break the law will be held to account, and we have again contacted the organisers of the protest this morning to ensure this point is understood.As Assistant Commissioner <person>Luke Cornelius</person> made clear earlier this week, it is our strong preference that the protest does not occur at this time, while the restrictions in relation to public gatherings remain in place.If it is to proceed then it must be conducted in a manner which does not breach the Chief Health Officer directions.We have also been clear that it would not be practical to issue infringements to thousands of persons congregating for a protest. We wish to keep the protest a peaceful one.That said, after the event and as per other recent protests, we will assess the evidence of the protest and if it did breach CHO guidelines we will not hesitate to issue infringement notices to the organisers. We will also consider other persons whom it may be appropriate to infringe.Meanwhile,  Police are taking the organisers ofSydney's simultaneous  protest to the Supreme Court Premier <person>Gladys Berejiklian</person> said it \"never was and never will be\" the state's intention to allow thousands of people to be \"flagrantly disregarding the [state's] health orders\".Prime Minister <person>Scott Morrison</person> also urged people not to attend protests which are planned to take place across the country.\"Our message is very clear,\" <person>Mr Morrison</person> said. \"The health risks and the risks of people coming into close proximity are real, and Australians have worked incredibly hard in recent months and undergone great sacrifices to protect the health of the most vulnerable, and that has included our Indigenous communities.\"Gatherings of more than 20 people are not permitted under 's current regulations but more than 30,000 people have indicated they will attend or are interested in this weekend's march against police brutality.A  rally in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> last weekend.Credit:Organisers have asked people to wear masks, bring hand sanitiser and self-isolate afterwards if they can, but <person>Dr Sutton</person> said now was not the time to hold a protest.\"There is a risk that all of the gains that we have made are put at risk by people gathering in large numbers,\" he said.\"It takes a single individual who is infectious to potentially transmit to many others in a mass gathering setting.\"I am advising people not to attend. There are other ways to protest.\"<person>Dr Sutton</person> said anyone who ignores advice to not attend should stay 1.5 metres apart and wear a mask if they can.However, he said this would be difficult when people are protesting loudly.\"That's what protests do so that adds to my concern about the risk of transmission,\" he said.Premier <person>Daniel Andrews</person> has one clear message to protesters: \"Don't go\" and find a safer way to make the same point.\"We are in the middle of a global pandemic. This is serious,\" <person>Mr Andrews</person> said.\"We don't want all the hard work, all the sacrifice that ns have made, frittered away by people gathering to make an important point, but it is not the only way to make that point.\"There were three new COVID-19 cases in  recorded overnight, taking the total number of people who have had the virus to 1681. There are currently 74 active cases in the state.Of the new cases, two were returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one was a prep student from <org>Newbury Primary School</org> in Craigieburn.The student had no symptoms last week and developed symptoms over the weekend.The school is closed for cleaning and will reopen next week.<person>Mr Morrison</person> said one of the government's biggest worries at the start of the coronavirus outbreak was the potential impact on Indigenous communities.\"This isn't about people's ability to express themselves and engage in protest activity, we all respect that,\" he said.But <person>Mr Morrison</person> urged protesters to find another way to express their views without putting their health and that of others at risk, along with \"the great gains we have been able to make as a country in recent months\".\"I encourage people not to attend for those reasons and those reasons only,\" he said.The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, made up of federal, state and territory chief health officers, released a statement after its meeting on Friday afternoon stating that the expert body \"is extremely concerned about proposed large gatherings for protests over the coming weekend and beyond\".\"Australians are reminded that in our recent past a single person infected more than 35 others,\" the statement said.\"This virus is very, very infectious.\"Sign up to our Coronavirus Update newsletterGet our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.
