They then met up and exited the building and the next graduate entered with their family. The ceremonies began at <chron>3 p.m.</chron> and were followed by graduates from <org>Franklin County High</org> who followed the same pattern. A parade in their honor was held at <chron>7 p.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>At <org>West Side High</org>, wind and rain changed plans to hold the graduation ceremony on the school's football field to in the <org>Dahle Fine Arts Center</org>. Graduates were seated six feet apart on the stage while groups of four supporters were invited to sit separated from others in the auditorium.</p>\n\n<p>The graduation ceremonies were live-streamed and recorded. They can be found on YouTube.</p>",
