    "text": "NORTH CHICAGO, Illinois, June 4 \\-- AbbVie issued the following news release:\n\n\\- Long-term results from the SELECT-COMPARE and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY studies\nshowed that RINVOQ\u2122 (upadacitinib, 15 mg) continued to improve signs and\nsymptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis through 72 and 84 weeks,\nrespectively[1,2]\n\n\\- Results from SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE showed RINVOQ inhibited\nstructural joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving RINVOQ as\nmonotherapy or in combination with MTX at almost two years[3]\n\n\\- RINVOQ's safety profile was consistent across the pivotal Phase 3 program,\nwith no new safety signals identified[1-5]\n\nAbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today\nannounced new long-term results showing that once daily upadacitinib continued\nto improve signs and symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at 72 and\n84 weeks in the SELECT-COMPARE (upadacitinib, 15 mg in combination with\nmethotrexate [MTX]) and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY (upadacitinib, 15 mg and 30 mg)\nPhase 3 clinical trials, respectively.[1,2] The safety profile of upadacitinib\n(15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy or upadacitinib (15 mg) in combination with MTX\nwas consistent with that observed in the previously reported integrated Phase\n3 safety analysis in rheumatoid arthritis, with no new safety risks\ndetected.[1-5]\n\nAdditionally, approximate two-year data (96 weeks) from the SELECT-EARLY\n(upadacitinib, 15 mg and 30 mg) and SELECT-COMPARE clinical trials showed that\nupadacitinib was effective in inhibiting structural joint damage as\nmonotherapy or in combination with MTX.3 Full results were presented today at\nthe 2020\n\nAnnual European E-Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR).\n\nRINVOQ\u2122, a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor discovered and developed by\nAbbVie, is approved as an oral, once daily, 15 mg therapy for adults with\nmoderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis.[1-5]\n\n\"These new long-term data showcase the potential of RINVOQ to provide relief\nfrom the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, both as a monotherapy and\nin combination with methotrexate,\" said Isidro Villanueva, vice president,\nmedical affairs immunology, AbbVie. \"We are excited to share these results\nwith the rheumatology community reinforcing RINVOQ as an important treatment\noption that may help more patients living with rheumatoid arthritis reach\ntheir goals in disease management.\"\n\nSELECT-COMPARE Results at 72 Weeks\n\nResults of this Long-Term Extension (LTE) of the SELECT-COMPARE study show\nthat RINVOQ plus MTX maintained higher levels of clinical response, including\nremission compared to adalimumab plus MTX, through week 72.[1]\n\nDisclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at\n<https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/new-long-term-data-from-rinvoq-\nupadacitinib-15-mg-phase-3-studies-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-presented-\nat-2020-annual-european-e-congress-rheumatology-eular.htm>)\n\nThe safety profile of RINVOQ (15 mg) in combination with MTX was generally\nconsistent with that observed in the previously reported integrated Phase 3\nsafety analysis in rheumatoid arthritis, with no new safety risks detected.1,4\nThrough the data cut-off, serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred at 12.7\nevents/100PY (per 100 patient years) on RINVOQ (15 mg) in combination with\nMTX, compared to 15.9 events/100PY on adalimumab in combination with MTX.[1]\nThe rate of serious infections was 3.7 events/100PY on RINVOQ (15 mg) plus MTX\nand 4.3 events/100PY on adalimumab plus MTX.[1] There were eight deaths on\nRINVOQ (0.6/100PY) and six deaths on adalimumab (1.2/100PY), including non-\ntreatment emergent deaths.1 There were eight major adverse cardiac events\n(MACE) through the study duration, including five on RINVOQ (0.4/100PY) and\nthree on adalimumab (0.6/100PY).[1] There were four patients with venous\nthromboembolic events (VTE) reported on RINVOQ (0.3/100PY) and five reported\non adalimumab (1.0/100 PY).[1]\n\nSELECT-MONOTHERAPY Results at 84 Weeks\n\nIn this LTE of the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study, patients who received continued\nMTX in the first phase of the study were switched to receive blinded\nupadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg) at week 14 based on pre-specified assignment at\nbaseline.[2] Results of this LTE show that upadacitinib monotherapy resulted\nin continued improvements in rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms through\n84 weeks.[2]\n\nDisclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at\n<https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/new-long-term-data-from-rinvoq-\nupadacitinib-15-mg-phase-3-studies-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-presented-\nat-2020-annual-european-e-congress-rheumatology-eular.htm>)\n\nThe safety profile of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy at week 84\nwas generally consistent with that observed in the previously reported\nintegrated Phase 3 safety analysis in rheumatoid arthritis, with no new safety\nrisks detected.[2,4] Through week 84, SAEs occurred at 18.5 events/100PY (per\n100 patient years) on upadacitinib 15 mg and 16.9 events/100PY on upadacitinib\n30 mg.[2] The most common SAE was pneumonia.[2] Events of herpes zoster,\nhepatic disorder and creatine phosphokinase elevations were higher among\npatients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, while rates of serious infection and\nmalignancy were comparable between upadacitinib 30 mg and 15 mg.[2] Seven\npatients experienced MACE (15 mg, 0.5/100 PY; 30 mg, 1.2/100 PY) and there\nwere five VTE (15 mg, 0.9/100 PY; 30 mg, 0.2/100 PY).[2] All MACE and VTE\noccurred in patients with underlying risk factors.[2] There were three deaths\neach (0.7/100PY) on upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg, including non-treatment\nemergent deaths.[2]\n\nRadiographic Inhibition at Approximately Two Years: SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-\nCOMPARE\n\nBoth SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE enrolled rheumatoid arthritis patients at\nhigh risk for progressive structural damage with baseline erosive joint damage\nand/or seropositivity.[3] RINVOQ inhibited structural joint damage in MTX-\nnaive patients receiving RINVOQ monotherapy and in patients with an inadequate\nresponse to MTX in combination with MTX.[3]\n\nDisclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed

RINVOQ\u2122 (upadacitinib, 15 mg)\n\nDiscovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and\nreversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated\ninflammatory diseases.5-14 In August 2019, RINVOQ received U.S. FDA approval\nfor adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who\nhave had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In December\n2019, RINVOQ was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of\nadult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have\nresponded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-\nmodifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid\narthritis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis,\npsoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, atopic\ndermatitis, ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis are ongoing.1-3,7-14\n\nAbout SELECT-COMPARE[1]\n\nSELECT-COMPARE is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study\ndesigned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RINVOQ compared to placebo and\nadalimumab in adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid\narthritis who had an inadequate response to methotrexate and continued a\nstable background of MTX. Patients received background MTX and were randomized\n2:2:1 to receive RINVOQ (15 mg, once daily), placebo or adalimumab (given as a\nsubcutaneous injection of 40 mg every other week).\n\nThe primary endpoints of the first phase included the percentage of subjects\nachieving ACR20 and clinical remission (based on DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of\ntreatment compared to placebo. Ranked secondary endpoints included change in\nthe mTSS compared to placebo and a comparison versus adalimumab in percentage\nof subjects achieving ACR50, low disease activity, changes in pain as measured\nby the Patient's Assessment of Pain (based on VAS) and changes in physical\nfunction, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability-Index\n(HAQ-DI). The trial is ongoing and included a 48-week randomized, double-blind\ntreatment period followed by a long-term extension study of up to five years.\n\nMore information on this trial can be found at\n[www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT02629159).\n\nAbout SELECT-MONOTHERAPY[2]\n\nSELECT-MONOTHERAPY is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,\nparallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of\nupadacitinib monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe active\nrheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to a stable dose of\nmethotrexate. Patients were randomized to switch from MTX to upadacitinib\nmonotherapy (15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) or continue on their prior stable\ndose of MTX in a blinded manner.\n\nThe primary endpoints of the first phase included the percentage of patients\nachieving an ACR20 response and low disease activity after 14 weeks of\ntreatment. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving\nACR50, ACR70 and clinical remission at week 14, HAQ-DI, duration of morning\nstiffness and health-related quality of life (QoL) by SF-36. The trial is\nongoing, and the second phase is a blinded long-term extension period to\nevaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of the two once daily\ndoses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy in patients who have\ncompleted the first phase.\n\nMore information on this trial can be found at\n[www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT02706951).\n\nAbout SELECT-EARLY[3]\n\nSELECT-EARLY is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-\ngroup, active comparator controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and\nefficacy of upadacitinib monotherapy compared to MTX monotherapy in adult\npatients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who are MTX-\nnaive. In the first phase of the study, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to\nreceive upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) or MTX. It includes a Japan\nsub-study in which subjects were randomized 2:1:1:1 to receive upadacitinib\n(7.5 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) or MTX.\n\nThe primary endpoints included the percentage of subjects achieving ACR50\nresponse and clinical remission (based on DAS28-CRP) compared to MTX after 12\nweeks and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively. Ranked secondary endpoints\nincluded the percentage of patients achieving ACR20 response, ACR70 response\nand low disease activity, as well as changes in the mTSS and HAQ-DI. The trial\nis ongoing and includes a 48-week randomized, double-blind treatment period\nfollowed by a long-term extension period for up to an additional four years.\n\nMore information on this trial can be found at\n[www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT02706873).\n\nImportant EU Safety Information about RINVOQ\u2122 (upadacitinib)[5]\n\nRINVOQ is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance\nor to any of the excipients, in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or\nactive serious infections, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and\nduring pregnancy.\n\nUse in combination with other potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.\n\nSerious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients\nreceiving upadacitinib. The most frequent serious infections reported included\npneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported.\nAmong opportunistic infections, TB, multidermatomal herpes zoster,\noral/oesophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with\nupadacitinib. Prior to initiating upadacitinib, consider the risks and\nbenefits of treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infection or with\na history of a serious or opportunistic infection, in patients who have been\nexposed to TB or have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic\nmycoses, and in patients with underlying conditions that may predispose them\nto infection. Upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted if a patient develops\na serious or opportunistic infection. As there is a higher incidence of\ninfections in patients \u226575 years of age, caution should be used when treating\nthis population.\n\nPatients should be screened for TB before starting upadacitinib therapy. Anti-\nTB therapy should be considered prior to initiation of upadacitinib in\npatients with previously untreated latent TB or in patients with risk factors\nfor TB infection.\n\nViral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, were reported in\nclinical studies. Consider interruption of therapy if a patient develops\nherpes zoster until the episode resolves. Screening for viral hepatitis and\nmonitoring for reactivation should be performed before starting and during\ntherapy with upadacitinib.\n\nThe use of live, attenuated vaccines during, or immediately prior to therapy\nis not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with\nall immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to\ninitiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.\n\nThe risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with\nrheumatoid arthritis (RA). Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase\nthe risk of malignancies, including lymphoma. The clinical data are currently\nlimited and long-term studies are ongoing. Malignancies, including non-\nmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with\nupadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior\nto initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a\nsuccessfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy\nin patients who develop a malignancy. Periodic skin examination is recommended\nfor patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count\n&lt;500 cells/mm3, or haemoglobin levels &lt;8 g/dL were reported in &lt;1% of\npatients in clinical trials. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be\ntemporarily interrupted, in patients with these haematological abnormalities\nobserved during routine patient management.\n\nRA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients\ntreated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension,\nhyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.\n\nUpadacitinib treatment was associated with increases in lipid parameters,\nincluding total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol. The effect of these lipid parameter\nelevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\nTreatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of\nliver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. If increases in ALT or AST are\nobserved during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is\nsuspected, upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted until this diagnosis is\nexcluded.\n\nEvents of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been\nreported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib.\nUpadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE.\nRisk factors that should be considered in determining the patient's risk for\nDVT/PE include older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, patients\nundergoing major surgery, and prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features\nof DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment should be discontinued and patients\nshould be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment.\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse drug reactions are upper respiratory tract\ninfections (13.5%), nausea (3.5%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase\n(2.5%), and cough (2.2%). The most common serious adverse reactions were\nserious infections.\n\nPlease see the full SmPC for complete prescribing information at\nwww.EMA.europa.eu. Globally, prescribing information varies; refer to the\nindividual country product label for complete information.\n\nAbout HUMIRA\u00ae in the European Union[15]\n\nHUMIRA, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of\nmoderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the\nresponse to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including methotrexate,\nhas been inadequate.\n\nImportant EU Safety Information about HUMIRA\u00ae (adalimumab)[15]\n\nHUMIRA is contraindicated in patients with active tuberculosis or other severe\ninfections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections and in patients with\nmoderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV). It is also\ncontraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any\nof the excipients; serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been\nreported. The use of HUMIRA increases the risk of developing serious\ninfections, including hepatitis B reactivation, which may, in rare cases, be\nlife-threatening. Rare cases of lymphoma and leukemia have been reported in\npatients treated with HUMIRA. On rare occasions, a severe type of cancer\ncalled hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been observed and often results in\ndeath. A risk for the development of malignancies in patients treated with\nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. Rare cases of pancytopenia, aplastic\nanaemia, demyelinating disease, lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-\nJohnson syndrome have been reported in patients treated with HUMIRA. The most\nfrequently reported adverse events across all indications included respiratory\ninfections, injection site reactions, headache and musculoskeletal pain.\n\nAbout AbbVie in Rheumatology\n\nFor more than 20 years, AbbVie has been dedicated to improving care for people\nliving with rheumatic diseases.

results from the SELECT-COMPARE and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY studies showed that RINVOQ&#8482; (upadacitinib, 15 mg) continued to improve signs and symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis through 72 and 84 weeks, respectively[1,2]</p><p>- Results from SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE showed RINVOQ inhibited structural joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving RINVOQ as monotherapy or in combination with MTX at almost two years[3]</p><p>- RINVOQ's safety profile was consistent across the pivotal Phase 3 program, with no new safety signals identified[1-5]</p><p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:ABBV\">AbbVie</org> (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, today announced new long-term results showing that once daily upadacitinib continued to improve signs and symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at 72 and 84 weeks in the SELECT-COMPARE (upadacitinib, 15 mg in combination with methotrexate [MTX]) and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY (upadacitinib, 15 mg and 30 mg) Phase 3 clinical trials, respectively.[1,2] The safety profile of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy or upadacitinib (15 mg) in combination with MTX was consistent with that observed in the previously reported integrated Phase 3 safety analysis in rheumatoid arthritis, with no new safety risks detected.[1-5]</p><p>Additionally, approximate two-year data (96 weeks) from the SELECT-EARLY (upadacitinib, 15 mg and 30 mg) and SELECT-COMPARE clinical trials showed that upadacitinib was effective in inhibiting structural joint

deaths on RINVOQ (0.6/100PY) and six deaths on adalimumab (1.2/100PY), including non-treatment emergent deaths.1 There were eight major adverse cardiac events (MACE) through the study duration, including five on RINVOQ (0.4/100PY) and three on adalimumab (0.6/100PY).[1] There were four patients with venous thromboembolic events (VTE) reported on RINVOQ (0.3/100PY) and five reported on adalimumab (1.0/100 PY).[1]</p><p>SELECT-MONOTHERAPY Results at 84 Weeks</p><p>In this LTE of the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study, patients who received continued MTX in the first phase of the study were switched to receive blinded upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg) at week 14 based on pre-specified assignment at baseline.[2] Results of this LTE show that upadacitinib monotherapy resulted in continued

safety profile of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy at week 84 was generally consistent with that observed in the previously reported integrated Phase 3 safety analysis in rheumatoid arthritis, with no new safety risks detected.[2,4] Through week 84, SAEs occurred at 18.5 events/100PY (per 100 patient years) on upadacitinib 15 mg and 16.9 events/100PY on upadacitinib 30 mg.[2] The most common SAE was pneumonia.[2] Events of herpes zoster, hepatic disorder and creatine phosphokinase elevations were higher among patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, while rates of serious infection and malignancy were comparable between upadacitinib 30 mg and 15 mg.[2] Seven patients experienced MACE (15 mg, 0.5/100 PY; 30 mg, 1.2/100 PY) and there were five VTE (15 mg, 0.9/100 PY; 30 mg, 0.2/100 PY).[2] All MACE and VTE occurred in patients with underlying risk factors.[2] There were three deaths each (0.7/100PY) on upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg, including non-treatment emergent deaths.[2]</p><p>Radiographic Inhibition at Approximately Two Years: SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE</p><p>Both SELECT-EARLY and SELECT-COMPARE enrolled rheumatoid arthritis patients at high risk for progressive structural damage with baseline erosive joint damage and/or seropositivity.[3] RINVOQ inhibited structural joint damage in MTX-na&#239;ve patients receiving RINVOQ monotherapy and in

RINVOQ&#8482; (upadacitinib, 15 mg)</p><p>Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.5-14 In <chron>August 2019</chron>, RINVOQ received <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> FDA approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In <chron>December 2019</chron>, RINVOQ was approved by the <org>European Commission</org> for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The approved dose for RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis is 15 mg. Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis are ongoing.1-3,7-14</p><p>About SELECT-COMPARE[1]</p><p>SELECT-COMPARE is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RINVOQ compared to placebo and adalimumab in adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to methotrexate and continued a stable background of MTX. Patients received background MTX and were randomized 2:2:1 to receive RINVOQ (15 mg, once daily), placebo or adalimumab (given as a subcutaneous injection of 40 mg every other week).</p><p>The primary endpoints of the first phase included the percentage of subjects achieving ACR20 and clinical remission (based on DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. Ranked secondary endpoints included change in the mTSS compared to placebo and a comparison versus adalimumab in percentage of subjects achieving ACR50, low disease activity, changes in pain as measured by the Patient's Assessment of Pain (based on VAS) and changes in physical function, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability-Index (HAQ-DI). The trial is ongoing and included a 48-week randomized, double-blind treatment period followed by a long-term extension study of up to five years.</p><p>More information on this trial can be found at <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> (NCT02629159).</p><p>About SELECT-MONOTHERAPY[2]</p><p>SELECT-MONOTHERAPY is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to a stable dose of methotrexate. Patients were randomized to switch from MTX to upadacitinib monotherapy (15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) or continue on their prior stable dose of MTX in a blinded manner.</p><p>The primary endpoints of the first phase included the percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response and low disease activity after 14 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving ACR50, ACR70 and clinical remission at week 14, HAQ-DI, duration of morning stiffness and health-related quality of life (QoL) by SF-36. The trial is ongoing, and the second phase is a blinded long-term extension period to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of the two once daily doses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg) monotherapy in patients who have completed the first phase.</p><p>More information on this trial can be found at <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a> (NCT02706951).</p><p>About SELECT-EARLY[3]</p><p>SELECT-EARLY is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active comparator controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib monotherapy compared to MTX monotherapy in adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who are MTX-na&#239;ve. In the first phase of the study, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) or MTX. It includes a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> sub-study in which subjects were randomized 2:1:1:1 to receive upadacitinib (7.5 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg, once daily) or MTX.</p><p>The primary endpoints included the percentage of subjects achieving ACR50 response and clinical remission (based on DAS28-CRP) compared to MTX after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment, respectively.

The most frequent serious infections reported included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of bacterial meningitis have been reported. Among opportunistic infections, TB, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/oesophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis have been reported with upadacitinib. Prior to initiating upadacitinib, consider the risks and benefits of treatment in patients with chronic or recurrent infection or with a history of a serious or opportunistic infection, in patients who have been exposed to TB or have resided or travelled in areas of endemic TB or endemic mycoses, and in patients with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. As there is a higher incidence of infections in patients &#8805;75 years of age, caution should be used when treating this population.</p><p>Patients should be screened for TB before starting upadacitinib therapy. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior to initiation of upadacitinib in patients with previously untreated latent TB or in patients with risk factors for TB infection.</p><p>Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes zoster, were reported in clinical studies. Consider interruption of therapy if a patient develops herpes zoster until the episode resolves. Screening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed before starting and during therapy with upadacitinib.</p><p>The use of live, attenuated vaccines during, or immediately prior to therapy is not recommended. It is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, prior to initiating upadacitinib, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.</p><p>The risk of malignancies, including lymphoma is increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancies, including lymphoma. The clinical data are currently limited and long-term studies are ongoing. Malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported in patients treated with upadacitinib. Consider the risks and benefits of upadacitinib treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or when considering continuing upadacitinib therapy in patients who develop a malignancy. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.</p><p>Absolute neutrophil count &amp;lt;1000 cells/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count &amp;lt;500 cells/mm3, or haemoglobin levels &amp;lt;8 g/dL were reported in &amp;lt;1% of patients in clinical trials. Treatment should not be initiated, or should be temporarily interrupted, in patients with these haematological abnormalities observed during routine patient management.</p><p>RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. Patients treated with upadacitinib should have risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.</p><p>Upadacitinib treatment was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p><p>Treatment with upadacitinib was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, upadacitinib therapy should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.</p><p>Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib. Upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients at high risk for DVT/PE. Risk factors that should be considered in determining the patient's risk for DVT/PE include older age, obesity, a medical history of DVT/PE, patients undergoing major surgery, and prolonged immobilisation. If clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment.</p><p>The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (13.5%), nausea (3.5%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (2.5%), and cough (2.2%). The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections.</p><p>Please see the full SmPC for complete prescribing information at www.EMA.europa.eu. Globally, prescribing information varies; refer to the individual country product label for complete information.</p><p>About HUMIRA&#174; in the European Union[15]</p><p>HUMIRA, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including methotrexate, has been inadequate.</p><p>Important EU Safety Information about HUMIRA&#174; (adalimumab)[15]</p><p>HUMIRA is contraindicated in patients with active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, and opportunistic infections and in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV). It is also contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to the active substance or to any of the excipients; serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported. The use of HUMIRA increases the risk of developing serious infections, including hepatitis B reactivation, which may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. Rare cases of lymphoma and leukemia have been reported in patients treated with HUMIRA. On rare occasions, a severe type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been observed and often results in death. A risk for the development of malignancies in patients treated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. Rare cases of pancytopenia, aplastic anaemia, demyelinating disease, lupus, lupus-related conditions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported in patients treated with HUMIRA. The most frequently reported adverse events across all indications included respiratory infections, injection site reactions, headache and musculoskeletal pain.</p><p>About AbbVie in Rheumatology</p><p>For more than 20 years, AbbVie has been dedicated to improving care for people living with rheumatic diseases.
