    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Chemicals &\nChemistry Business Daily Business Daily Daily \\-- From Washington, D.C.,\nNewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Alberti,\nCarlo (Fabriano, IT); Gasparini, Alberto (Fabriano, IT); Lacche, Tiziano\n(Matelica, IT), filed on January 21, 2020, was made available online on May\n21, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee is WHIRLPOOL EMEA S.P.A. (Pero (MI), Italy).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"At present, several typologies of cooking tops are\navailable on the market, the most widespread typology using one or more gas\nburners, wherein the amount of heat necessary for cooking food is generated\nthrough combustion of a gas appropriately mixed with air.\n\n\"Systems of burners are also known in the art, which have a substantially\ncircular shape and have two concentric burners, typically an outer burner and\nan inner burner.\n\n\"Such systems of burners are known as 'double-crown', and include gas supply\nmeans, said supply means comprising, for example, a pair of gas inlet ducts\nassociated with independent control valves, so that the two burners (i.e. the\nouter burner and the inner burner) can be used either together or separately\nin order to achieve good variability and a homogeneous distribution of the\nheat to be supplied to the cooking containers. As an alternative, both\nconcentric burners may be fed by a single gas inlet duct, with an associated\ntap, which simultaneously feeds the different intake channels that supply the\nair-gas mixture to the concentric burners.\n\n\"Such systems of burners further include a cup comprising at least one first\nchamber for supplying the air-gas mixture to the inner burner and at least one\nsecond chamber for supplying said air-gas mixture to the outer burner, said\ncup being associated with the supply means and with at least one flame divider\n(or cap).\n\n\"The cup and the flame divider may be positioned on the cooking top where the\nsystem of burners is installed, and use the air above the cooking top as\nprimary air to be mixed with the gas.\n\n\"Also, the cup is usually made of die-cast aluminum, while the flame divider\nor cap is usually made of enameled cast iron (or brass alloy or steel) and\nacts as a cup closing element.\n\n\"These systems of burners known in the art typically propagate a flame known\nas 'crown flame'; a 'crown flame' is a flame with a substantially radial\ndirection of propagation, i.e., a flame that propagates outwards from the gas\nburner in a substantially radial direction with respect to the burner axis,\nand therefore in a direction which is substantially tangential to a visible\nsurface of the cooking top. Said 'crown flame', when emitted at an\ninsufficient height above the cooking top, may cause low-CO.sub.2 combustion,\nresulting in the generation of a high level of unburnt products (CO and\nNO.sub.x).\n\n\"Systems of burners are also known in the art which have a flame divider or\ncap with a plurality of apertures adapted to generate a 'carpet flame', i.e.,\na flame that propagates out of the system of burners in a substantially axial\ndirection with respect to the axis of the system of burners, and therefore in\na direction which is substantially orthogonal to a visible surface of the\ncooking top.\n\n\"A carpet flame may be a total carpet flame or a perimetric carpet flame,\ndepending on whether it covers a geometric figure (generally a circle)\nentirely or just the peripheral portion of said geometric figure (generally a\ncircular crown).\n\n\"Also in the case of a perimetric carpet flame, a plurality of concentric rows\nof apertures can generate a 'carpet flame', in particular for the purpose of\noptimally heating also the central portion of the base of a cooking vessel\npositioned over the gas burner.\n\n\"However, the solutions known in the art suffer from a few drawbacks.\n\n\"In particular, in the solutions known in the art, the components of the\nsystem of burners are substantially made by die casting, being typically made\nof die-cast aluminum alloys; it is clear that this solution is an expensive\none, and therefore a cooking top comprising such a system of burners will\nimplement solutions that are not very effective in economical terms.\n\n\"Furthermore, in the solutions known in the art, the flame divider is\npositioned flush with the visible surface of the cooking top. When the system\nof burners is in use, it has been noticed that such a realization may cause\noverheating of that area of the visible surface of the cooking top which is\nclosest to the system of burners; it is clear that this overheating may also\ncause damages to the cooking top, particularly when the latter is made from\nglassy materials or the like.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for\nthis patent application: \"It is an object of the present device to provide a\nsystem of gas burners, in particular for a cooking top for household use, and\nan associated cooking top which are adapted to overcome the drawbacks of\nprior-art solutions.\n\n\"Consequently, it is one object of the present device to provide a system of\ngas burners and an associated cooking top which are so realized as to prove\nparticularly efficient and economical.\n\n\"In particular, it is one object of the present device to provide a system of\ngas burners which is so realized as to ensure optimal gas efficiency while at\nthe same time lowering its production costs.\n\n\"It is another object of the present device to provide a system of gas burners\nwhich is so realized as to prevent overheating of the region of the cooking\ntop proximal to the system of burners, and to avoid possible damage to the\ncooking top, particularly when the latter is made from glassy materials or the\nlike.\n\n\"Said objects are achieved by the present device through a system of gas\nburners, in particular for a cooking top for household use, and an associated\ncooking top incorporating the features set out in the appended claims, which\nare intended to be an integral part of the present description.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Chemicals &amp; Chemistry Business Daily Business Daily Daily</org> -- From <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, D.C.</location>, NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Alberti, Carlo (Fabriano, IT); Gasparini, Alberto (Fabriano, IT); Lacche, Tiziano (Matelica, IT), filed on <chron>January 21, 2020</chron>, was made available online on <chron>May 21, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The patent&#8217;s assignee is <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2709574955\">WHIRLPOOL EMEA S.P.A</org>. (Pero (MI), <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location>).</p>\n<p>News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;At present, several typologies of cooking tops are available on the market, the most widespread typology using one or more gas burners, wherein the amount of heat necessary for cooking food is generated through combustion of a gas appropriately mixed with air.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Systems of burners are also known in the art, which have a substantially circular shape and have two concentric burners, typically an outer burner and an inner burner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such systems of burners are known as &#8216;double-crown&#8217;, and include gas supply means, said supply means comprising, for example, a pair of gas inlet ducts associated with independent control valves, so that the two burners (i.e. the outer burner and the inner burner) can be used either together or separately in order to achieve good variability and a homogeneous distribution of the heat to be supplied to the cooking containers. As an alternative, both concentric burners may be fed by a single gas inlet duct, with an associated tap, which simultaneously feeds the different intake channels that supply the air-gas mixture to the concentric burners.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such systems of burners further include a cup comprising at least one first chamber for supplying the air-gas mixture to the inner burner and at least one second chamber for supplying said air-gas mixture to the outer burner, said cup being associated with the supply means and with at least one flame divider (or cap).</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cup and the flame divider may be positioned on the cooking top where the system of burners is installed, and use the air above the cooking top as primary air to be mixed with the gas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, the cup is usually made of die-cast aluminum, while the flame divider or cap is usually made of enameled cast iron (or brass alloy or steel) and acts as a cup closing element.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These systems of burners known in the art typically propagate a flame known as &#8216;crown flame&#8217;; a &#8216;crown flame&#8217; is a flame with a substantially radial direction of propagation, i.e., a flame that propagates outwards from the gas burner in a substantially radial direction with respect to the burner axis, and therefore in a direction which is substantially tangential to a visible surface of the cooking top. Said &#8216;crown flame&#8217;, when emitted at an insufficient height above the cooking top, may cause low-CO.sub.2 combustion, resulting in the generation of a high level of unburnt products (CO and NO.sub.x).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Systems of burners are also known in the art which have a flame divider or cap with a plurality of apertures adapted to generate a &#8216;carpet flame&#8217;, i.e., a flame that propagates out of the system of burners in a substantially axial direction with respect to the axis of the system of burners, and therefore in a direction which is substantially orthogonal to a visible surface of the cooking top.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A carpet flame may be a total carpet flame or a perimetric carpet flame, depending on whether it covers a geometric figure (generally a circle) entirely or just the peripheral portion of said geometric figure (generally a circular crown).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also in the case of a perimetric carpet flame, a plurality of concentric rows of apertures can generate a &#8216;carpet flame&#8217;, in particular for the purpose of optimally heating also the central portion of the base of a cooking vessel positioned over the gas burner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, the solutions known in the art suffer from a few drawbacks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In particular, in the solutions known in the art, the components of the system of burners are substantially made by die casting, being typically made of die-cast aluminum alloys; it is clear that this solution is an expensive one, and therefore a cooking top comprising such a system of burners will implement solutions that are not very effective in economical terms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Furthermore, in the solutions known in the art, the flame divider is positioned flush with the visible surface of the cooking top. When the system of burners is in use, it has been noticed that such a realization may cause overheating of that area of the visible surface of the cooking top which is closest to the system of burners; it is clear that this overheating may also cause damages to the cooking top, particularly when the latter is made from glassy materials or the like.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;It is an object of the present device to provide a system of gas burners, in particular for a cooking top for household use, and an associated cooking top which are adapted to overcome the drawbacks of prior-art solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Consequently, it is one object of the present device to provide a system of gas burners and an associated cooking top which are so realized as to prove particularly efficient and economical.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In particular, it is one object of the present device to provide a system of gas burners which is so realized as to ensure optimal gas efficiency while at the same time lowering its production costs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is another object of the present device to provide a system of gas burners which is so realized as to prevent overheating of the region of the cooking top proximal to the system of burners, and to avoid possible damage to the cooking top, particularly when the latter is made from glassy materials or the like.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Said objects are achieved by the present device through a system of gas burners, in particular for a cooking top for household use, and an associated cooking top incorporating the features set out in the appended claims, which are intended to be an integral part of the present description.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
