    "text": "Transition in McSherrystown\n\nEditor, Gettysburg Times,\n\nMcSherrystown Borough has been advised that neither it nor its officials\nshould publicly disclose personnel matters.\n\nDespite that advice, at the May 27, 2020 Borough Council meeting, a council\nmember chose to ignore that advice and launched into his own commentary\nregarding a personnel issue which, I believe, was misinformed.\n\nA second council member took advantage of the chaos created by the outburst,\nalso ignoring those instructions. In my opinion, sensitive and potentially\nlegally-protected information concerning current and past borough personnel\nwas discussed publicly. During these statements, the technology used to host\nthe meeting did not permit me, as the council president to comment, to caution\nor otherwise interact with these council members. Although order was\neventually restored, it is my opinion that the civility and decorum residents\nexpect from their council was lost.\n\nEqually concerning to me is that employees may feel as if the privacy, to\nwhich they are entitled as employees, was compromised. While we are grateful\nfor the ability technology grants us to bring these meetings to you, the\nunfortunate circumstances that occurred during this meeting has resulted in\nnew measures that we will be implementing immediately to assure, should there\nbe an additional attempt by any member(s) to cause a disruption, there will be\nimmediate actions to stop disturbances followed swiftly by any corrective\naction which the Borough Code may permit.\n\nThe Borough's response to an evolving personnel situation was meant to be\ndeliberate and transparent, and we will attempt to regain the composure,\nresolve, and patience needed to do what is best for our Borough, which\nincludes its taxpayers, residents, staff, and its elected officials.\n\nSometimes what is best for all stakeholders takes times and patience to\ndiscern clearly. We are currently researching options and developing a plan to\nmove forward, cautiously, and deliberately. Our focus is to assess our current\nstrengths while creating a comprehensive overview, which will outline the\nqualifications which will best serve the needs of our borough moving forward.\nWhen we are ready to advertise for this position, we will notify the community\nand publish the qualifications we are seeking. In the meantime, our staff and\ncouncil will manage affairs appropriately and effectively. Thank you for your\nunderstanding and patience as we navigate this period of transition.\n\nWilliam F. Smith Jr.,\n\nMcSherrystown",

In my opinion, sensitive and potentially legally-protected information concerning current and past borough personnel was discussed publicly. During these statements, the technology used to host the meeting did not permit me, as the council president to comment, to caution or otherwise interact with these council members. Although order was eventually restored, it is my opinion that the civility and decorum residents expect from their council was lost.</p>\n\n<p>Equally concerning to me is that employees may feel as if the privacy, to which they are entitled as employees, was compromised. While we are grateful for the ability technology grants us to bring these meetings to you, the unfortunate circumstances that occurred during this meeting has resulted in new measures that we will be implementing immediately to assure, should there be an additional attempt by any member(s) to cause a disruption, there will be immediate actions to stop disturbances followed swiftly by any corrective action which the Borough Code may permit.</p>\n\n<p>The Borough's response to an evolving personnel situation was meant to be deliberate and transparent, and we will attempt to regain the composure, resolve, and patience needed to do what is best for our Borough, which includes its taxpayers, residents, staff, and its elected officials.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes what is best for all stakeholders takes times and patience to discern clearly. We are currently researching options and developing a plan to move forward, cautiously, and deliberately. Our focus is to assess our current strengths while creating a comprehensive overview, which will outline the qualifications which will best serve the needs of our borough moving forward. When we are ready to advertise for this position, we will notify the community and publish the qualifications we are seeking. In the meantime, our staff and council will manage affairs appropriately and effectively. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we navigate this period of transition.</p>\n\n<p><person>William F.
