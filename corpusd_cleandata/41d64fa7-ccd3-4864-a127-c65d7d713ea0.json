    "text": "Impressive is an understatement.\n\nBy now, you know that our reviews are predominantly of higher-end vehicles --\nwith higher-end packages and loaded to the roofline with options. Fact is, we\ncan only test and review the vehicles that show up.\n\nThis week, Mazda wanted a piece of the review pie and delivered its economical\nMazda3.\n\nThis four-door sedan blew me away, starting with a base price of only $21,500.\nFour package options include Base, Select, Preferred and Premium. All-wheel-\ndrive was also a drive-train selection.\n\nRegardless of package selection, the 3 comes with a 2.5L SKYACTIV dual-\noverhead-cam,16-valve, four-cylinder engine providing 186 horsepower and 186\nft.-lb. of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission with sport mode is\nstandard. The i-Active-All-Wheel-Drive system is a few thousand dollars more,\nbut well worth the spend. Our Mazda3 AWD Premium sported a bunch of standard\npackage features: Bose 12-speaker premium sound, heated front seats, SiriusXM\nradio, 18-inch wheels, leather seats and a power moon roof. All pretty upscale\nif you ask me.\n\nThe Mazda3 has what I like to call a shark-like exterior. It is really\nappealing and serves its purpose; providing an easy-on-the-eyes, inexpensive\nride for the average consumer.\n\nThe Mazda Connect infotainment system is simple and requires no thought at\nall. Protruding from the dash, it delivers easy-to-use and friendly\ncommunication setup, radio favorites and adjustable settings. Its center\nconsole turn dial is really easy to use and models BMW's set-up, serving the\ndriver easily (without the added chrome of course).\n\nPush-button ignition was also standard on our Machine Grey Metallic premium\ntester. The ride was quiet, the seats were comfortable (although the cabin was\nsmall). The 3 compares to a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla in the compact sedan\nclass.\n\nFor Mazda, I get it. Provide a competitive alternative to Honda and Toyota\nwhile offering a great-looking, reliable and inexpensive option to the\nconsumer. I have to give them credit, not only did they deliver on that, but\nthey blew me away while doing it.\n\nI assure you, Mazda has come to the table with nothing but the diamonds. Test\none and you'll be just as impressed.\n\nMazda3\n\nMSRP: $27,900\n\nAs tested: $28,000\n\nMPG: 27 city, 33 highway, 30.9 as tested",

    "html": "<p>Impressive is an understatement.</p>\n<p>By now, you know that our reviews are predominantly of higher-end vehicles -- with higher-end packages and loaded to the roofline with options. Fact is, we can only test and review the vehicles that show up.</p>\n\n<p>This week, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Tokyo:7261\">Mazda</org> wanted a piece of the review pie and delivered its economical Mazda3.</p>\n\n<p>This four-door sedan blew me away, starting with a base price of only <money>$21,500</money>. Four package options include Base, Select, Preferred and Premium. All-wheel-drive was also a drive-train selection.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of package selection, the 3 comes with a 2.5L SKYACTIV dual-overhead-cam,16-valve, four-cylinder engine providing 186 horsepower and 186 ft.-lb. of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission with sport mode is standard. The i-Active-All-Wheel-Drive system is a few thousand dollars more, but well worth the spend. Our Mazda3 AWD Premium sported a bunch of standard package features: Bose 12-speaker premium sound, heated front seats, <org>SiriusXM</org> radio, 18-inch wheels, leather seats and a power moon roof. All pretty upscale if you ask me.</p>\n\n<p>The Mazda3 has what I like to call a shark-like exterior. It is really appealing and serves its purpose; providing an easy-on-the-eyes, inexpensive ride for the average consumer.</p>\n\n<p>The Mazda Connect infotainment system is simple and requires no thought at all. Protruding from the dash, it delivers easy-to-use and friendly communication setup, radio favorites and adjustable settings. Its center console turn dial is really easy to use and models <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Frankfurt:BMW3\">BMW's</org> set-up, serving the driver easily (without the added chrome of course).</p>\n\n<p>Push-button ignition was also standard on our Machine <person>Grey Metallic</person> premium tester. The ride was quiet, the seats were comfortable (although the cabin was small). The 3 compares to a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla in the compact sedan class.</p>\n\n<p>For <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Tokyo:7261\">Mazda</org>, I get it. Provide a competitive alternative to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Tokyo:7267\">Honda</org> and <org>Toyota</org> while offering a great-looking, reliable and inexpensive option to the consumer. I have to give them credit, not only did they deliver on that, but they blew me away while doing it.</p>\n\n<p>I assure you, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Tokyo:7261\">Mazda</org> has come to the table with nothing but the diamonds. Test one and you'll be just as impressed.</p>\n\n<p>Mazda3</p>\n\n<p>MSRP: <money>$27,900</money></p>\n\n<p>As tested: <money>$28,000</money></p>\n\n<p>MPG: 27 city, 33 highway, 30.9 as tested</p>",
