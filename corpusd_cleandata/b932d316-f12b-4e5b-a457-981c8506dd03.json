Charlie\nBaker's directives, as well as those of the Board of Health.\n\n\"Once these standards are created, the committee will work with department\nheads to gain input, as well as to address department specific requirements,\"\nDiNatale said. \"As these plans are formulated, we will be able to determine\nand provide specifics, as well as a timeline for implementation.\"\n\nResidents can visit the city's COVID-19 resource page for the full list of\npeople serving on the committees.\n\nThe mayor also gave an update regarding the virus during his briefing, saying\nthat 712 people had tested positive for the virus as of Friday.\n\nThere have been 52 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the city.\n\nHowever, DiNatale noted, this is the number of individuals who have died and\nwere positive for the virus, but the death records may vary as the virus may\nnot be the official cause of death.\n\nDiNatale encouraged residents to use the state's test site locator map, at\n[mass.gov](http://mass.gov), to find testing facilities nearby.",
