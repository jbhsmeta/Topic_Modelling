    "text": "DESLOGE \u0096 The Mineral Area 19u Orioles continued the trend from their first\nfour games by struggling to bunch several hits within a promising threat.\n\nBut a superb recovery from a rocky first inning by right-hander Blane Worley\nwas enough for his squad to complete a gradual comeback on Sunday.\n\nMax McKinney flopped safely into home plate on a game-ending wild pitch in the\neighth inning, and the Orioles edged the Southeast Missouri Perfectos 6-5 to\nopen a doubleheader.\n\nThe Orioles immediately trailed 4-0 and could not post multiple runs during a\nsingle rally despite putting their leadoff batter aboard in every frame.\n\nCody Ziegelmeyer stuck out his only batter faced to pick up the relief win\nafter working six innings one day earlier, and went 3-for-3 offensively with\nthree productive bunts.\n\nThe winning push was fueled when Brey Turner and McKinney were each plunked by\nerrant curve balls from reliever Warren Willard. Drew Breakfield later walked\nto load the bases.\n\nZiegelmeyer was batting with two outs as a delivery from Trae Davis bounced\noff the dish and caromed high to the backstop, enabling McKinney to head down\nthe line.\n\nWorley worked 7 2/3 innings and became more effective over the latter half of\nhis outing. He retired an 11th consecutive batter after winning an eight-pitch\nbattle for his fifth of six total strikeouts.\n\nAlthough he was on the precipice of a complete game more than once, the top of\nthe eighth inning was extended after second baseman Spencer Brown made a nifty\nstop but rushed a throwing error.\n\nZiegelmeyer inherited runners at first and second and fanned Davis to keep the\ncontest tied at 5-5. His bunt single had drawn a bad throw that brought home\nReilly Resinger in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nThe Orioles had three ensuing chances to deliver the winning run after\nZiegelmeyer stood at third base with one out. Willard escaped further damage\non that occasion while working around a subsequent error, as catcher Ethan\nKoenig also blocked two tricky pitches in the dirt.\n\nHeath Ayers yielded three runs on six hits over 3 1/3 innings in the start on\nthe mound, and powered his team by going 3-for-4 with two doubles and two runs\nscored.\n\nWyatt Lincoln and Tanner Dixon added two hits apiece, and found the shallow\noutfield with consecutive singles after Kaleb Richards drove in Jed Montgomery\nwith a sacrifice fly for a 1-0 edge.\n\nWorley induced a double-play ground ball to shortstop Ayden Morgan after\nissuing a leadoff walk in the second inning, and the Orioles steadily chipped\naway at their deficit.\n\nAfter doubles from Turner and McKinney trimmed the margin to 4-2 in the\nsecond, Dixon answered with an RBI double for the Perfectos in the third.\n\nTyler Thebeau walked and scored on a McKinney ground out in the fourth.\nZiegelmeyer squeezed in the lone run of the fifth after Resinger, Worley and\nDillon Wolberd singled.\n\nThe Perfectos turned two stellar double plays in game one. Koenig made a\ndiving catch behind the plate before throwing out an advancing Ziegelmeyer at\nthird base in the third inning. Richards made a diving catch up the middle to\nrob Brown of a second hit, and doubled off Connor Sullivan in the sixth.\n\nWorley singled in both plate appearances of game two, and the Orioles also got\ntwo hits from Morgan, Ziegelmeyer, Breakfield and Turner to highlight a 14-4\nrout.\n\nWolberd cruised through four innings for the win, allowing one run on two hits\nwhile striking out four. He navigated two errors unscathed in the third.\n\nZiegelmeyer doubled and scored on a Wolberd sacrifice fly, and RBI by Resinger\nand Worley helped to make it 5-0 after McKinney opened the second inning with\nanother double that landed near the base of the left-field fence.\n\nThe Orioles received four walks, and two more batters were hit by pitches\nduring a five-run rally that created a 10-0 separation in the third.\n\nFive hits produced three more tallies in the fourth. Morgan and Turner set the\ntable before Breakfield, Coltin Wilkerson and Resinger lined consecutive RBI\nsingles with two outs for a 13-1 advantage.\n\nAn RBI single by Cainin Heck ended the shutout bid for Wolberd in the top of\nthe fourth, and Dalton Gatewood briefly extended the game with a three-run\ndouble against Turner in the fifth.\n\nTurner retaliated with a game-ending single down the right-field line in the\nhome half off Montgomery, the fifth hurler utilized by the Perfectos.\n\nWhile summer baseball in many states either remains delayed or has been\ncompletely canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Babe Ruth League in\nMissouri decided to proceed as planned.\n\nThe Mineral Area club began its season last weekend, and commences another\nupcoming tournament on Thursday.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.desoge\">DESLOGE</location> &#150; The Mineral Area 19u <org>Orioles</org> continued the trend from their first four games by struggling to bunch several hits within a promising threat.</p>\n<p>But a superb recovery from a rocky first inning by right-hander <person>Blane Worley</person> was enough for his squad to complete a gradual comeback on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p><person>Max McKinney</person> flopped safely into home plate on a game-ending wild pitch in the eighth inning, and the <org>Orioles</org> edged the Southeast Missouri Perfectos 6-5 to open a doubleheader.</p>\n\n<p>The <org>Orioles</org> immediately trailed 4-0 and could not post multiple runs during a single rally despite putting their leadoff batter aboard in every frame.</p>\n\n<p><person>Cody Ziegelmeyer</person> stuck out his only batter faced to pick up the relief win after working six innings one day earlier, and went 3-for-3 offensively with three productive bunts.</p>\n\n<p>The winning push was fueled when <person>Brey Turner</person> and McKinney were each plunked by errant curve balls from reliever <person>Warren Willard</person>. <person>Drew Breakfield</person> later walked to load the bases.</p>\n\n<p>Ziegelmeyer was batting with two outs as a delivery from <person>Trae Davis</person> bounced off the dish and caromed high to the backstop, enabling McKinney to head down the line.</p>\n\n<p>Worley worked 7 2/3 innings and became more effective over the latter half of his outing. He retired an 11th consecutive batter after winning an eight-pitch battle for his fifth of six total strikeouts.</p>\n\n<p>Although he was on the precipice of a complete game more than once, the top of the eighth inning was extended after second baseman <person>Spencer Brown</person> made a nifty stop but rushed a throwing error.</p>\n\n<p>Ziegelmeyer inherited runners at first and second and fanned Davis to keep the contest tied at 5-5. His bunt single had drawn a bad throw that brought home <person>Reilly Resinger</person> in the bottom of the seventh.</p>\n\n<p>The <org>Orioles</org> had three ensuing chances to deliver the winning run after Ziegelmeyer stood at third base with one out. Willard escaped further damage on that occasion while working around a subsequent error, as catcher <person>Ethan Koenig</person> also blocked two tricky pitches in the dirt.</p>\n\n<p><person>Heath Ayers</person> yielded three runs on six hits over 3 1/3 innings in the start on the mound, and powered his team by going 3-for-4 with two doubles and two runs scored.</p>\n\n<p><person>Wyatt Lincoln</person> and <person>Tanner Dixon</person> added two hits apiece, and found the shallow outfield with consecutive singles after <person>Kaleb Richards</person> drove in <person>Jed Montgomery</person> with a sacrifice fly for a 1-0 edge.</p>\n\n<p>Worley induced a double-play ground ball to shortstop <person>Ayden Morgan</person> after issuing a leadoff walk in the second inning, and the <org>Orioles</org> steadily chipped away at their deficit.</p>\n\n<p>After doubles from Turner and McKinney trimmed the margin to 4-2 in the second, Dixon answered with an RBI double for the Perfectos in the third.</p>\n\n<p><person>Tyler Thebeau</person> walked and scored on a McKinney ground out in the fourth. Ziegelmeyer squeezed in the lone run of the fifth after Resinger, Worley and <person>Dillon Wolberd</person> singled.</p>\n\n<p>The Perfectos turned two stellar double plays in game one. Koenig made a diving catch behind the plate before throwing out an advancing Ziegelmeyer at third base in the third inning. Richards made a diving catch up the middle to rob Brown of a second hit, and doubled off <person>Connor Sullivan</person> in the sixth.</p>\n\n<p>Worley singled in both plate appearances of game two, and the <org>Orioles</org> also got two hits from Morgan, Ziegelmeyer, Breakfield and Turner to highlight a 14-4 rout.</p>\n\n<p>Wolberd cruised through four innings for the win, allowing one run on two hits while striking out four. He navigated two errors unscathed in the third.</p>\n\n<p>Ziegelmeyer doubled and scored on a Wolberd sacrifice fly, and RBI by Resinger and Worley helped to make it 5-0 after McKinney opened the second inning with another double that landed near the base of the left-field fence.</p>\n\n<p>The <org>Orioles</org> received four walks, and two more batters were hit by pitches during a five-run rally that created a 10-0 separation in the third.</p>\n\n<p>Five hits produced three more tallies in the fourth. Morgan and Turner set the table before Breakfield, <person>Coltin Wilkerson</person> and Resinger lined consecutive RBI singles with two outs for a 13-1 advantage.</p>\n\n<p>An RBI single by Cainin Heck ended the shutout bid for Wolberd in the top of the fourth, and <person>Dalton Gatewood</person> briefly extended the game with a three-run double against Turner in the fifth.</p>\n\n<p>Turner retaliated with a game-ending single down the right-field line in the home half off Montgomery, the fifth hurler utilized by the Perfectos.</p>\n\n<p>While summer baseball in many states either remains delayed or has been completely canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the <org>Babe Ruth League</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mo\">Missouri</location> decided to proceed as planned.</p>\n\n<p>The Mineral Area club began its season last weekend, and commences another upcoming tournament on Thursday.</p>",
