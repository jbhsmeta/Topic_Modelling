    "text": "PLYMOUTH \\- Despite the threat of coronavirus, Plymouth 400, Inc. is\nproceeding with plans to commemorate the town's quadricentenial anniversary -\njust not in the usual way.\n\nThe nonprofit organization responsible for promoting Plymouth's founding is\nrevamping many programs for 2020 and beyond to be virtual. In addition, some\nevents are being rescheduled for when the pandemic is past or have been\ncancelled altogether.\n\n\"The show must go on, and it will go on,\" said Michele Pecoraro, executive\ndirector of Plymouth 400\\. \"We have been thinking differently about how that\nwill be. From the start, we wanted to virtually spread the word about our\ncommunity. It looks like we will be doing that more than we originally\nthought.\"\n\nPlymouth 400 released a new schedule for the rest of the year and into the\nnext highlighting the revisions. One of the big changes is to Illuminate\nThanksgiving 2020, planned for Nov. 20-25. The annual tradition, which\nincludes a candle-lighting ceremony and presentation of One Small Candle\nawards, will become virtual. Pecoraro said NBC10 in Boston and PACTV will\nbroadcast the event, though parts of it may be live.\n\n\"It all depends on the public health data and guidelines at that time,\" she\nsaid. \"However, some elements of Illuminate Thanksgiving, such as the\nProcession of Lights, may be held as a limited and appropriately distanced\nevent.\"\n\nIn addition, Plymouth 400 is considering making the Indigenous History\nConference a virtual event. Scheduled for Oct. 29-30 at Bridgewater State\nUniversity, this symposium could be converted to an online program if the\npandemic doesn't improve.\n\nRescheduled events include:\n\nPlymouth 400 Remembrance Ceremony - Now planned for April 23, 2021. This\nceremony will be held with visiting dignitaries and local and state officials\nto remember the Pilgrims and Wampanoag people of 1620 and their contributions\nand sacrifices. The ceremony will take place at various monuments around\nPlymouth.\n\nWampanoag Ancestors Walk - Originally scheduled for August, the event will be\nmoved to May 2021.\n\nOfficial Maritime Salute to the 400th Anniversary - This large-scale\nwaterfront event was planned for this year but has been moved to June 25-27,\n2021. An extra day is being added to include a 400th anniversary ceremony to\nbegin the weekend.\n\nThe following events have been cancelled:\n\nPlymouth 400 Commemoration Opening Ceremony - Originally scheduled for April\n24. While it is not possible to recreate this event in its entirety, some\nelements of the ceremony will be incorporated into other events.\n\nOfficial State House Salute to the 400th Anniversary - Planned for Sept. 14.\nIt may be rescheduled for September 2021.\n\nEmbarkation Multicultural Festival - Scheduled for Sept. 19. Some elements of\nthis program may be added to other events.\n\nOther activities will continue with few or no changes because of the pandemic.\nPecoraro said these programs are more informative and instructive through\nonline or other learning platforms, so they can proceed without concern for\nthe health and safety of visitors and participants.\n\n\"Plymouth 400's planning has always been focused on education, legacy projects\nand awareness building,\" she said. \"Many projects continue to take shape as\n2020 unfolds, including countless educational programs focused on 17th century\nhistory.\"\n\nSome of these initiatives include:\n\nPlymouth 400 Online Educational Resources - Offering a variety of activities\nfor children and families, as well as advanced reading materials for adults,\nabout 17th century history.\n\n#IlluminateNOW - This social media initiative based on Illuminate Thanksgiving\ninvites people to \"give thanks, give back and let it shine\" through a variety\nof activities.\n\n\"OUR\" Story: 400 Years of Wampanoag History - Though the multimedia traveling\nmuseum exhibit is on hold for now, a virtual tour is in development to tell\nthe 1620 story from the perspective of the indigenous people.\n\nMassachusetts Chronicles - This project includes an illustrated book with a\nbalanced view of the state's history. A collaboration between Plymouth 400,\nPlymouth Public Schools and Bridgewater State University.\n\nQuadricentennial Park \\- Pilgrim Hall Museum and Plymouth 400 are partnering\nto build this site on Cole's Hill. It will provide an outdoor interpretive\nexperience of the town's history.\n\nFor the latest information about the town's anniversary plans, visit\n<https://www.plymouth400inc.org/>.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">PLYMOUTH</location> - Despite the threat of coronavirus, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400, Inc. is proceeding with plans to commemorate the town's quadricentenial anniversary - just not in the usual way.</p>\n<p>The nonprofit organization responsible for promoting <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth's</location> founding is revamping many programs for 2020 and beyond to be virtual. In addition, some events are being rescheduled for when the pandemic is past or have been cancelled altogether.</p>\n\n<p>\"The show must go on, and it will go on,\" said <person>Michele Pecoraro</person>, executive director of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400. \"We have been thinking differently about how that will be. From the start, we wanted to virtually spread the word about our community. It looks like we will be doing that more than we originally thought.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400 released a new schedule for the rest of the year and into the next highlighting the revisions. One of the big changes is to Illuminate <chron>Thanksgiving</chron> 2020, planned for <chron>Nov. 20-25</chron>. The annual tradition, which includes a candle-lighting ceremony and presentation of One Small Candle awards, will become virtual. Pecoraro said NBC10 in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\">Boston</location> and PACTV will broadcast the event, though parts of it may be live.</p>\n\n<p>\"It all depends on the public health data and guidelines at that time,\" she said. \"However, some elements of Illuminate <chron>Thanksgiving</chron>, such as the Procession of Lights, may be held as a limited and appropriately distanced event.\"</p>\n\n<p>In addition, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400 is considering making the <org>Indigenous History Conference</org> a virtual event. Scheduled for <chron>Oct. 29-30</chron> at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0205956715\">Bridgewater State University</org>, this symposium could be converted to an online program if the pandemic doesn't improve.</p>\n\n<p>Rescheduled events include:</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400 Remembrance Ceremony - Now planned for <chron>April 23, 2021</chron>. This ceremony will be held with visiting dignitaries and local and state officials to remember the Pilgrims and Wampanoag people of 1620 and their contributions and sacrifices. The ceremony will take place at various monuments around <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Wampanoag Ancestors Walk - Originally scheduled for August, the event will be moved to <chron>May 2021</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Official Maritime Salute to the 400th Anniversary - This large-scale waterfront event was planned for this year but has been moved to <chron>June 25-27, 2021</chron>. An extra day is being added to include a 400th anniversary ceremony to begin the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>The following events have been cancelled:</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400 Commemoration Opening Ceremony - Originally scheduled for <chron>April 24</chron>. While it is not possible to recreate this event in its entirety, some elements of the ceremony will be incorporated into other events.</p>\n\n<p>Official State House Salute to the 400th Anniversary - Planned for <chron>Sept. 14</chron>. It may be rescheduled for <chron>September 2021</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Embarkation Multicultural Festival - Scheduled for <chron>Sept. 19</chron>. Some elements of this program may be added to other events.</p>\n\n<p>Other activities will continue with few or no changes because of the pandemic. Pecoraro said these programs are more informative and instructive through online or other learning platforms, so they can proceed without concern for the health and safety of visitors and participants.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400's planning has always been focused on education, legacy projects and awareness building,\" she said. \"Many projects continue to take shape as 2020 unfolds, including countless educational programs focused on 17th century history.\"</p>\n\n<p>Some of these initiatives include:</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400 Online Educational Resources - Offering a variety of activities for children and families, as well as advanced reading materials for adults, about 17th century history.</p>\n\n<p>#IlluminateNOW - This social media initiative based on Illuminate <chron>Thanksgiving</chron> invites people to \"give thanks, give back and let it shine\" through a variety of activities.</p>\n\n<p>\"OUR\" Story: 400 Years of Wampanoag History - Though the multimedia traveling museum exhibit is on hold for now, a virtual tour is in development to tell the 1620 story from the perspective of the indigenous people.</p>\n\n<p>Massachusetts Chronicles - This project includes an illustrated book with a balanced view of the state's history. A collaboration between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400, <org>Plymouth Public Schools</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0205956715\">Bridgewater State University</org>.</p>\n\n<p><location>Quadricentennial Park</location> - <org>Pilgrim Hall Museum</org> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.plymou\">Plymouth</location> 400 are partnering to build this site on Cole's Hill. It will provide an outdoor interpretive experience of the town's history.</p>\n\n<p>For the latest information about the town's anniversary plans, visit <a href=\"https://www.plymouth400inc.org/\">https://www.plymouth400inc.org/</a>.</p>",
