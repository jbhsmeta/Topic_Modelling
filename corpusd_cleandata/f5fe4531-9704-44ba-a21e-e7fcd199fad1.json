    "text": "MEADVILLE, Pennsylvania, June 5 \\-- Allegheny College issued the following\nnews:\n\nAllegheny College has received a one-year COVID-19 Rapid Response grant of\n$29,750 from the Erie Community Foundation to support the Lake Effect Leaders\nAmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) Project.\n\nThe goal of the AmeriCorps VISTA Project, which is funded through the\nCorporation for National and Community Service, is to boost the capacity of\nnonprofit organizations in the region that are battling poverty and to enhance\nthe educational prospects for children and youth. The grant will be used to\nsubsidize the cost of 20 AmeriCorps VISTA members serving at nonprofit\norganizations, educational institutions, and government entities located in\nErie County. For 2020-2021, 20 VISTAs will serve in Erie, and five will serve\nin Crawford County. In addition, one VISTA Leader will serve both counties.\n\nAs communities across the United States have seen a disproportionate impact\nfrom the pandemic on individuals from lower-income backgrounds, services from\nlocal nonprofits are integral to support these individuals during this global\ncrisis. The grant project will be led by Colin Hurley, Director of Community\nEngagement at Mercyhurst University, and Ben Helkowski, Lake Effect Leaders\nProject Coordinator at Allegheny College.\n\nThe 20 VISTA placements in Erie County that will receive funding are: Bayfront\nEast Side Taskforce, Bayfront Maritime Center, City of Erie (two placements),\nEdinboro University, Erie Together, Gannon University & Erie GAINS (two\nplacements), Gannon University & Mother Teresa Academy, Mercyhurst University,\nMercy Center for Women, Mission Empower, Our West Bayfront, Penn State\nBehrend, ServErie, Sisters of St. Joseph Neighborhood Network, Strong Vincent\nMiddle School, YMCA of Greater Erie, Youth Leadership Institute of Erie and\nthe United Way of Erie County.\n\nVISTA members address needs such as grant writing, assessing service impact\nand gaps, best practices research, and volunteer recruitment and management,\nand, per the national program's interim guidelines for VISTA, placements may\nnow engage in direct service if deemed an effort to combat challenges related\nto COVID-19. Current examples include Our West Bayfront's distribution of\nCOVID-19 awareness materials and ServErie's initiative to create proper masks\nfor residents.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout Lake Effect Leaders\n\nFor more than 15 years, the Lake Effect Leaders (LEL) AmeriCorps VISTA program\nhas been an intermediary sponsor that works with nonprofits, government\nagencies and institutions of education in Northwestern Pennsylvania. Led by a\npartnership consisting of Allegheny College, Gannon University, Mercyhurst\nUniversity and as of May 2020, Penn State Behrend, the program professionally\nequips VISTA members to serve critical capacity-building functions in\nnonprofit organizations in order to eliminate poverty. If you are interested\nin becoming a VISTA member, please contact\n[bhelkowski@allegheny.edu](mailto:bhelkowski@allegheny.edu)\n\nAbout The Erie Community Foundation\n\nFounded in 1935, The Erie Community Foundation is a collection of over 800\ncharitable endowments operating under the administrative umbrella of a single\npublic charity.

Current examples include Our West Bayfront's distribution of COVID-19 awareness materials and ServErie's initiative to create proper masks for residents.</p><p>* * *</p><p>About Lake Effect Leaders</p><p>For more than 15 years, the Lake Effect Leaders (LEL) <org>AmeriCorps VISTA</org> program has been an intermediary sponsor that works with nonprofits, government agencies and institutions of education in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Northwestern Pennsylvania</location>.
