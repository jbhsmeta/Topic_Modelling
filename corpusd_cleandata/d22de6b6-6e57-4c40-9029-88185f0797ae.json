    "text": "LYNNWOOD, Washington, June 4 \\-- Zumiez Inc issued the following news release:\n\n\\- Company Ended First Quarter with $217 Million in Cash and Marketable\nSecurities and No Debt\n\n\\- Company Provides COVID-19 Business Update\n\nZumiez Inc. (NASDAQ: ZUMZ) a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear,\nequipment and accessories for young men and women, today reported results for\nthe first quarter ended May 2, 2020.\n\nTotal net sales for the first quarter ended May 2, 2020 (13 weeks) decreased\n35.3% to $137.8 million from $212.9 million in the first quarter ended May 4,\n2019 (13 weeks). Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $21.1\nmillion, or $(0.84) per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.8 million,\nor $0.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.\nIncluded in this amount is $1.5 million or $0.5 cents associated with the\nimpairment of our right of use assets and fixed assets.\n\nAt May 2, 2020, cash and current marketable securities increased $49.2 million\nor 29.3% to $217.2 million, compared to cash and current marketable securities\nof $168.0 million at May 4, 2019. The increase in cash and current marketable\nsecurities was driven by cash generated through operations throughout 2019\npartially offset by capital expenditures and $13.4 million of share\nrepurchases through the company's stock buyback program prior to our stores\nclosing due to COVID-19. We ended the quarter with no debt.\n\n\"We came into fiscal 2020 in a strong financial position and the new year was\noff to a good start with first quarter sales and earnings tracking ahead of\nexpectations through early-March,\" commented Rick Brooks, Chief Executive\nOfficer of Zumiez Inc. \"Following the outbreak of COVID-19 we closed all of\nour stores in accordance with state and local guidelines to protect the health\nand safety of our customers, employees and the communities in which we\noperate. We immediately shifted our focus to increasing financial flexibility\nand directing resources towards continuing to engage and service our customers\nthrough our digital platforms. We took many difficult actions, but remained\ncommitted to our full time employees across the organization who have helped\nus create the strong culture and brand that has driven our success. We have\nmade this investment throughout the closures and we believe we are already\nseeing a return on our investment in our ability to connect with our\ncommunities during closure and open stores quickly and safely as government\nguidelines allow. With a history of managing the capital of the organization\nand quickly adapting to changing environments, we are confident in Zumiez's\nability to weather this crisis and emerge well positioned to further expand\nour market share and resume our long track record of creating value for our\nshareholders.\"\n\nActions Taken In Response to COVID-19\n\nAs part of the COVID-19 response, the Company has taken the following actions\nto preserve financial liquidity and financial flexibility:\n\n* Suspended hiring, laid off virtually all part-time staff, eliminated substantially all planned fiscal 2020 bonuses and delayed majority of merit raises,\n\n* Lowered operating costs, including travel, marketing and other non-essential items,\n\n* Reduced capital spend by delaying or cancelling select projects,\n\n* Reduced planned inventory receipts by cancelling or delaying orders,\n\n* Suspended rent payments while negotiating rent relief with landlords and delayed or canceled planned new store openings,\n\n* Extended payment terms for both merchandise and non-merchandise vendor invoices, and\n\n* Paused share repurchases.\n\nStore Re-Opening Update\n\nLate in the first quarter the Company began reopening some stores with most at\nreduced hours in accordance with governmental regulations. The company ended\nthe first quarter with 65 or 9% of our 719 stores open. We ended the period\nending May 30, 2020 with 493 open stores consisting of 432 Zumiez stores in\nNorth America, 49 Blue Tomato stores in Europe and 12 Fast Times stores in\nAustralia, representing 69% of our total stores. All stores are operating\nunder enhanced measures to ensure the health and safety of employees and\ncustomers, including\n\n* requiring our employees to wear masks,\n\n* providing hand sanitizer in multiple locations throughout the store,\n\n* implementing enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols,\n\n* reconfiguring sales floors to promote physical distancing, and\n\n* modifying employee and customer interactions to limit contact.\n\nMay 2020 Sales\n\nThe Company's total net sales decreased 8.6% for the four-week period ended\nMay 30, 2020 compared to an increase of 2.6% for the four-week period ended\nJune 1, 2019 primarily based on closures continuing into May with some areas\nnot expected to open until June, offset by better than expected results in\nstores open and our e-commerce demand. Comparable store sales for locations\nopened in May as well as our e-commerce traffic increased 79.6%. By channel,\nour open store comparable sales were 38.5% and our e-commerce sales were\n181.6% in May.\n\nOutlook\n\nDue to the fast-moving nature of this situation and the uncertainty of impacts\non revenue and costs, the Company previously withdrew its full year fiscal\n2020 guidance. The Company is not providing an updated outlook at this time\nfor the second quarter or the year.\n\nA conference call will be held today to discuss first quarter fiscal 2020\nresults and will be webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET on <http://ir.zumiez.com>.\nParticipants may also dial (570) 990-9934 followed by the conference\nidentification code of 7543829.\n\nAbout Zumiez Inc.\n\nZumiez is a leading specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, accessories and\nhardgoods for young men and women who want to express their individuality\nthrough the fashion, music, art and culture of action sports, streetwear, and\nother unique lifestyles.

Included in this amount is <money>$1.5 million</money> or <money>$0.5 cents</money> associated with the impairment of our right of use assets and fixed assets.</p><p>At <chron>May 2, 2020</chron>, cash and current marketable securities increased <money>$49.2 million</money> or 29.3% to <money>$217.2 million</money>, compared to cash and current marketable securities of <money>$168.0 million</money> at <chron>May 4, 2019</chron>. The increase in cash and current marketable securities was driven by cash generated through operations throughout 2019 partially offset by capital expenditures and <money>$13.4 million</money> of share repurchases through the company's stock buyback program prior to our stores closing due to COVID-19. We ended the quarter with no debt.</p><p>&#8220;We came into fiscal 2020 in a strong financial position and the new year was off to a good start with first quarter sales and earnings tracking ahead of expectations through early-March,&#8221; commented <person value=\"APIN:0406361892\">Rick Brooks</person>, Chief Executive Officer of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:ZUMZ\">Zumiez Inc.</org> &#8220;Following the outbreak of COVID-19 we closed all of our stores in accordance with state and local guidelines to protect the health and safety of our customers, employees and the communities in which we operate.&#160; We immediately shifted our focus to increasing financial flexibility and directing resources towards continuing to engage and service our customers through our digital platforms. We took many difficult actions, but remained committed to our full time employees across the organization who have helped us create the strong culture and brand that has driven our success.&#160; We have made this investment throughout the closures and we believe we are already seeing a return on our investment in our ability to connect with our communities during closure and open stores quickly and safely as government guidelines allow. With a history of managing the capital of the organization and quickly adapting to changing environments, we are confident in Zumiez&#8217;s ability to weather this crisis and emerge well positioned to further expand our market share and resume our long track record of creating value for our shareholders.&#8221;</p><p>Actions Taken In Response to COVID-19</p><p>As part of the COVID-19 response, the Company has taken the following actions to preserve financial liquidity and financial flexibility:</p><p>* Suspended hiring, laid off virtually all part-time staff, eliminated substantially all planned fiscal 2020 bonuses and delayed majority of merit raises,</p><p>* Lowered operating costs, including travel, marketing and other non-essential items,</p><p>* Reduced capital spend by delaying or cancelling select projects,</p><p>* Reduced planned inventory receipts by cancelling or delaying orders,</p><p>* Suspended rent payments while negotiating rent relief with landlords and delayed or canceled planned new store openings,</p><p>* Extended payment terms for both merchandise and non-merchandise vendor invoices, and</p><p>* Paused share repurchases.</p><p>Store Re-Opening Update</p><p>Late in the first quarter the Company began reopening some stores with most at reduced hours in accordance with governmental regulations.&#160; The company ended the first quarter with 65 or 9% of our 719 stores open.
