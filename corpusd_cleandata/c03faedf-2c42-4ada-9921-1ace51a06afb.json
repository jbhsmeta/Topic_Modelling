    "text": "Retailers, restaurants will be permitted to open with capacity limits, social\ndistancing\n\nLAANSING, Mich., June 1, 2020; Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed\nExecutive Order 2020-110, rescinding her Safer at Home order and moving the\nentire state to phase four of the MI Safe Start Plan.\n\nThe governors order will allow retailers to reopen on June 4 and restaurants\nto reopen on June 8, both subject to capacity limits. Day camps for children\nwill likewise be permitted to open on June 8.\n\nEffective immediately, groups of 100 or less will be allowed gather outdoors\nwith social distancing. Office work that is not capable of being performed\nremotely can resume. And in-home services, including housecleaning services,\ncan resume operations.\n\nThe data has shown that we are ready to carefully move our state into the next\nphase of the MI Safe Start Plan, but we owe it to our brave frontline heroes\nto get this right, said Governor Whitmer. While Michiganders are no longer\nrequired to stay home, we must all continue to be smart and practice social\ndistancing, and encourage those who meet the criteria to get tested for\nCOVID-19. If we all do our part, our goal is to announce a shift to phase five\nfor the entire state prior to the fourth of July. Stay smart, stay safe, and\nlets all do our part.\n\nMichiganders must continue to wear facial coverings when in enclosed public\nspaces and should continue to take all reasonable presecution to protest\nthemselves, their loved ones, and the community. And they should continue to\nwork from home to the maximum extent possible.\n\nThe governor and I, along with a team of experts, have determined that our\nstate is ready to move into the next phase of the MI Safe Start Plan.\nHospitalization numbers are down, our frontline workers have PPE to last them\nseveral weeks, and the number of positive cases and deaths are declining, said\nMDHHS Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun.\nWe will continue to monitor the data and work closely with local health\ndepartments to ensure Michiganders practice safe social distancing. On behalf\nof our health care professionals and first responders on the front lines, we\nmust all be smart and be safe.\n\nAs the hardest-hit region in the state, Wayne County and its residents are\nready to safely return to greater activity and commerce, said Wayne County\nExecutive Warren C. Evans. We continue to vigilantly monitor the spread of\nCOVID19 and will do so to make sure the number of daily cases continues to\ndecline. Its is been an extremely difficulty three months for all of us, but\nthe social distancing measures we have put in place has slowed the spread of\nthis disease and saved lives. Today is an important step toward returning to\nsome semblance of normalcy, but it is important for all of to continue\nfollowing that safe distancing and work directives outlined in Stage 4 of the\nMI Safe Start plan.\n\nI appreciate Governor Whitmer for her diligence and commitment to reopening\nthe state safely. We look forward to reopening Detroit safely and efficiently,\nsaid Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.\n\nWe know we still have challenges to face, but moving into this next phase\nacknowledges the huge strides this state has made to slow the spread of this\ndeadly virus, said Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley. I appreciate Gov. Whitmers\ncaution and proactive response throughout this crisis. Her leadership has\nundoubtedly saved lives.\n\nThe last few months have been very hard for everyone. I applaud the Governor\nfor doing everything she can to keep us safe, said Lansing Mayor Andy Schor.\nAnd now that the curve has flattened and I am very excited that we have moved\ninto phase 4 and can have things start to reopen. Economic issues have been\nvery challenging in Lansing and across the state, but we know it was necessary\nto save lives. Now we are ready to get back to growing our city here in\nLansing and the economy throughout the state!\n\nSubject to local regulation, gyms and fitness centers may conduct outdoor\nclasses, practices, training sessions, or games, provided that coaches,\nspectators, and participants maintain six feet of distance from one another\nduring these activities. Outdoor pools can also reopen, with restricted\ncapacity.\n\nTo view the complete Executive Order 2020-110 visit\n[www.michigan.gov](http://www.michigan.gov)",

Day camps for children will likewise be permitted to open on <chron>June 8</chron>.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, groups of 100 or less will be allowed gather outdoors with social distancing. Office work that is not capable of being performed remotely can resume. And in-home services, including housecleaning services, can resume operations.</p>\n<p>The data has shown that we are ready to carefully move our state into the next phase of the MI Safe Start Plan, but we owe it to our brave frontline heroes to get this right, said <person>Governor Whitmer</person>. While Michiganders are no longer required to stay home, we must all continue to be smart and practice social distancing, and encourage those who meet the criteria to get tested for COVID-19. If we all do our part, our goal is to announce a shift to phase five for the entire state prior to the <chron>fourth of July</chron>. Stay smart, stay safe, and lets all do our part.</p>\n<p>Michiganders must continue to wear facial coverings when in enclosed public spaces and should continue to take all reasonable presecution to protest themselves, their loved ones, and the community. And they should continue to work from home to the maximum extent possible.</p>\n<p>The governor and I, along with a team of experts, have determined that our state is ready to move into the next phase of the MI Safe Start Plan. Hospitalization numbers are down, our frontline workers have PPE to last them several weeks, and the number of positive cases and deaths are declining, said MDHHS Chief Deputy for Health and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. We will continue to monitor the data and work closely with local health departments to ensure Michiganders practice safe social distancing. On behalf of our health care professionals and first responders on the front lines, we must all be smart and be safe.</p>\n<p>As the hardest-hit region in the state, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.wayne\">Wayne County</location> and its residents are ready to safely return to greater activity and commerce, said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.wayne\">Wayne County</location> Executive <person>Warren C. Evans</person>. We continue to vigilantly monitor the spread of COVID19 and will do so to make sure the number of daily cases continues to decline. Its is been an extremely difficulty three months for all of us, but the social distancing measures we have put in place has slowed the spread of this disease and saved lives. Today is an important step toward returning to some semblance of normalcy, but it is important for all of to continue following that safe distancing and work directives outlined in Stage 4 of the MI Safe Start plan.</p>\n<p>I appreciate <person>Governor Whitmer</person> for her diligence and commitment to reopening the state safely. We look forward to reopening <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.detrit\">Detroit</location> safely and efficiently, said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.detrit\">Detroit</location> Mayor <person>Mike Duggan</person>.</p>\n<p>We know we still have challenges to face, but moving into this next phase acknowledges the huge strides this state has made to slow the spread of this deadly virus, said Flint Mayor <person>Sheldon Neeley</person>. I appreciate Gov. Whitmers caution and proactive response throughout this crisis. Her leadership has undoubtedly saved lives.</p>\n<p>The last few months have been very hard for everyone. I applaud the Governor for doing everything she can to keep us safe, said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.lansin\">Lansing</location> Mayor <person>Andy Schor</person>. And now that the curve has flattened and I am very excited that we have moved into phase 4 and can have things start to reopen. Economic issues have been very challenging in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.lansin\">Lansing</location> and across the state, but we know it was necessary to save lives. Now we are ready to get back to growing our city here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.lansin\">Lansing</location> and the economy throughout the state!</p>\n<p>Subject to local regulation, gyms and fitness centers may conduct outdoor classes, practices, training sessions, or games, provided that coaches, spectators, and participants maintain six feet of distance from one another during these activities. Outdoor pools can also reopen, with restricted capacity.</p>\n<p>To view the complete Executive Order 2020-110 visit <a href=\"http://www.michigan.gov\">www.michigan.gov</a></p>",
