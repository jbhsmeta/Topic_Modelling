    "text": "Malibu-based real estate public relations company Lion & Orb Inc. is launching\nPressList, a publicity service that agents and brokers can use for their\nlistings.\n\nThe service will launch April 30 in 10 markets, including L.A.\n\nPressList matches properties with media, allowing for-sale homes to get\ngreater coverage.\n\nLion & Orb has partnered with Canada-based startup iGuide, which has developed\na camera and software that helps create floor plans with measurements and\nvirtual tours.\n\nAudie Chamberlain, founder and chief executive of Lion & Orb, has been\ninvolved in real estate PR, social media and marketing for years.\n\nChamberlain said he wanted to start PressList to move away from the\ntraditional marketing model used by many realtors.\n\n\"Never in the history of when I've been in real estate has there been a\ndedicated service to do the listings ad hoc,\" he said.\n\nUsually brokers use an in-house team or contract out with an expensive PR\ncompany to handle their media requests.\n\nChamberlain said PressList is different because it helps agents get press for\nindividual listings. \"Agents have never had the opportunity to do press for a\none-off listing,\" he said, adding that PressList \"only helps the customer with\nwhat they need when they need it.\"\n\nHere's how it works: An agent provides Lion & Orb with high-resolution images\nand information about a property. Lion & Orb then sends back a press release\nfor review and creates a pitch.\n\nThe next step for Lion & Orb is targeting media outlets that are a good fit\nfor the listing to maximize its exposure.\n\nThe company has \"accelerated a traditional PR campaign and condensed it into a\ntwo--to three-week cycle,\" Chamberlain said.\n\nThe service has a few different price points, and Chamberlain said a\nsubscription or membership model may become available.\n\nLion & Orb's partnership with Santa Monica-based real estate marketing firm\nLuxury Presence will also help clients, Chamberlain said.\n\nLuxury Presence does website design and development as well as digital\nmarketing, including SEO and social media. Its clients include Jade Mills, one\nof the top agents in Los Angeles County, and luxury brokerage Hilton & Hyland.\n\n\"They give us the opportunity where if you want to expand the campaign, if you\nwant to add a website or some paid component like Instagram or Facebook to it,\nwe offer that through our partnership,\" Chamberlain said. \"They offer us the\nopportunity to upsell on the press package.\"\n\nBy HANNAH MADANS Staff Reporter\n\nHannah Madans |\n[hmadans@labusinessjournal.com](mailto:hmadans@labusinessjournal.com)\n\nCaption: Signal Boost: PressList can help agents get media attention for their\nlistings.",

Lion &amp; Orb\nthen sends back a press release for review and creates a pitch.</p>\n\n<p>The next step for Lion &amp; Orb is targeting media outlets that\nare a good fit for the listing to maximize its exposure.</p>\n\n<p>The company has \"accelerated a traditional PR campaign and\ncondensed it into a two--to three-week cycle,\" Chamberlain said.</p>\n\n<p>The service has a few different price points, and Chamberlain said\na subscription or membership model may become available.</p>\n\n<p>Lion &amp; Orb's partnership with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanica\">Santa Monica</location>-based real\nestate marketing firm Luxury Presence will also help clients,\nChamberlain said.</p>\n\n<p>Luxury Presence does website design and development as well as\ndigital marketing, including SEO and social media. Its clients include\n<person>Jade Mills</person>, one of the top agents in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\">Los Angeles County</location>, and luxury\nbrokerage Hilton &amp; <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0959779084\">Hyland</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"They give us the opportunity where if you want to expand the\ncampaign, if you want to add a website or some paid component like\nInstagram or Facebook to it, we offer that through our\npartnership,\" Chamberlain said. \"They offer us the opportunity\nto upsell on the press package.\"</p>\n\n<p>By <org>HANNAH MADANS Staff Reporter</org></p>\n\n<p>Hannah Madans | <a href=\"mailto:hmadans@labusinessjournal.com\">hmadans@labusinessjournal.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Caption: Signal Boost: PressList can help agents get media\nattention for their listings.</p>",
