    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life\nScience Daily \\-- Research findings on Life Science Research \\- Reproduction\nand Fertility are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting\noriginating from Haryana, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated,\n\"An early and precise diagnosis of pregnancy in cows is critical to short the\ncalving interval and to improve their reproductive efficiency. Neutrophils are\nthe first blood cells to sensitize the embryo in the uterus and participate in\nmaternal recognition of pregnancy after getting induced by interferon tau\n(IFNt).\"\n\nFinancial supporters for this research include Department of Biotechnology,\nGovernment of West Bengal, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of\nIndia.\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Indian Council of\nAgricultural Research (ICAR) National Dairy Research Institute, \"To study the\nprotein abundance ratio, blood samples were collected on 0th, 10th, 18th and\n36th day post-artificial insemination (AI) from crossbred Karan Fries cows.\nNeutrophils were isolated through density gradient centrifugation and studied\nfor protein abundance by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with\nmass spectrometry (LC-MS). Protein abundance ratios for Myxovirus resistance\n(MX1 and MX2) were found to be higher (p <0.05) on day 10 and day 18 post-AI,\nwhereas Oligoadenylate synthetase-1 (OAS1) and Interferon stimulated gene-15\nubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15) proteins were more abundant on day 18 post-AI.\nThe relative mRNA expressions of these molecules were also studied by qPCR.\nThe gene expression of ISG15, MX1, MX2 and OAS1 was found to be higher (p\n<0.05) on day 10th, 18th and 36th post-AI compared to day 0.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study indicates\nthat ISGs on blood neutrophils are essential for the establishment of\npregnancy and may be targeted as potential biomarkers for pregnancy diagnosis\nin cows.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Proteomics and transcriptomics\nstudy reveals the utility of ISGs as novel molecules for early pregnancy\ndiagnosis in dairy cows. _Journal of Reproductive Immunology_ ,\n2020;140():103148. _Journal of Reproductive Immunology_ can be contacted at:\nElsevier Sci Ireland LTD, Customer Relations Manager, Bay 15, Shannon\nIndustrial Estate CO, Clare, Ireland.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>NewsRx Life Science Daily</org> -- Research findings on <org>Life Science Research</org> - Reproduction and Fertility are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.hr\">Haryana, India</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;An early and precise diagnosis of pregnancy in cows is critical to short the calving interval and to improve their reproductive efficiency. Neutrophils are the first blood cells to sensitize the embryo in the uterus and participate in maternal recognition of pregnancy after getting induced by interferon tau (IFNt).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Financial supporters for this research include <org>Department of Biotechnology</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1921290253\">Government of West Bengal</org>, <org>Ministry of Science and Technology</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2104947237\">Government of India</org>.</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the <org>Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) National Dairy Research Institute</org>, &#8220;To study the protein abundance ratio, blood samples were collected on 0th, 10th, 18th and 36th day post-artificial insemination (AI) from crossbred <person>Karan Fries</person> cows. Neutrophils were isolated through density gradient centrifugation and studied for protein abundance by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Protein abundance ratios for Myxovirus resistance (MX1 and MX2) were found to be higher (p &lt;0.05) on day 10 and day 18 post-AI, whereas Oligoadenylate synthetase-1 (OAS1) and Interferon stimulated gene-15 ubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15) proteins were more abundant on day 18 post-AI. The relative mRNA expressions of these molecules were also studied by qPCR. The gene expression of ISG15, MX1, MX2 and OAS1 was found to be higher (p &lt;0.05) on day 10th, 18th and 36th post-AI compared to day 0.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;The study indicates that ISGs on blood neutrophils are essential for the establishment of pregnancy and may be targeted as potential biomarkers for pregnancy diagnosis in cows.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Proteomics and transcriptomics study reveals the utility of ISGs as novel molecules for early pregnancy diagnosis in dairy cows. <em><org>Journal of Reproductive Immunology</org></em>, 2020;140():103148. <em><org>Journal of Reproductive Immunology</org></em> can be contacted at: <org>Elsevier Sci Ireland LTD</org>, Customer Relations Manager, Bay 15, Shannon Industrial Estate <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ie..coclre\">CO, Clare, Ireland</location>.
