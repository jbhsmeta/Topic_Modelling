    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at South Korea\nDaily Report -- Research findings on Forensics - Forensic and Legal Medicine\nare discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from Seoul, South\nKorea, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Statistics on death are the\nbasis of a country's health, safety, and welfare policies. Emergency\nphysicians issue a postmortem examination certificate (PEC) for death outside\nthe hospital as well as a death certificate (DC) for death in the hospital.\"\n\nFinancial supporters for this research include Ewha Alumni Medical Research\nGrant, Korean National Forensic service Grant.\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Ewha Womans\nUniversity, \"This study investigated the actual conditions and criteria for\nwriting a DC and PEC, writing environment, and doctor's experience. The\nphysicians' DC and PEC writing experience and demographic data were analyzed.\nThe questions focused on CPR, patient's medical certificate, time and place of\ndeath, difficulty in writing the PEC and DC, and education in certificate\nwriting. 229 emergency physicians were included. Physicians' opinions differed\nfor CPR patients in terms of time of death, location, and whether or not to\nissue DC/PEC. The causes of death were also different. Further, 76.9% of the\ndoctors did not have enough time to write a medical certificate and about 45%\nof them wrote it within 30 min; 76% had DC-related complaints, and 7.0% faced\nlegal problems due to the DC; 93.3% of the emergency physicians stated that a\ncoroner system is needed in South Korea. Emergency physicians are responsible\nfor writing DCs and PECs. The standards vary from physician to physician at\nthe time of writing. Writing DCs and PECs is also burdensome.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In South Korea, it\nis necessary to separate the DC and PEC, to develop national data management\nnetworks, and to introduce a postmortem examination system.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Study on death certificates and\npostmortem examination certificates written by Korean emergency physicians.\n_Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine_ , 2020;72():101960.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at South Korea Daily Report -- Research findings on Forensics - Forensic and Legal Medicine are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/kr..seoul\">Seoul, South Korea</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Statistics on death are the basis of a country&#8217;s health, safety, and welfare policies. Emergency physicians issue a postmortem examination certificate (PEC) for death outside the hospital as well as a death certificate (DC) for death in the hospital.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Financial supporters for this research include Ewha Alumni Medical Research Grant, Korean National Forensic service Grant.</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from <org>Ewha Womans University</org>, &#8220;This study investigated the actual conditions and criteria for writing a DC and PEC, writing environment, and doctor&#8217;s experience. The physicians&#8217; DC and PEC writing experience and demographic data were analyzed. The questions focused on CPR, patient&#8217;s medical certificate, time and place of death, difficulty in writing the PEC and DC, and education in certificate writing. 229 emergency physicians were included. Physicians&#8217; opinions differed for CPR patients in terms of time of death, location, and whether or not to issue DC/PEC. The causes of death were also different. Further, 76.9% of the doctors did not have enough time to write a medical certificate and about 45% of them wrote it within 30 min; 76% had DC-related complaints, and 7.0% faced legal problems due to the DC; 93.3% of the emergency physicians stated that a coroner system is needed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location>. Emergency physicians are responsible for writing DCs and PECs. The standards vary from physician to physician at the time of writing. Writing DCs and PECs is also burdensome.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;In South Korea, it is necessary to separate the DC and PEC, to develop national data management networks, and to introduce a postmortem examination system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Study on death certificates and postmortem examination certificates written by Korean emergency physicians. <em><org>Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine</org></em>, 2020;72():101960.
