    "text": "UNITED NATIONS-The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to move toward\nending the joint U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force in Sudan's vast western\nDarfur region and replacing it with a civilian mission focusing on the\ncountry's democratic transition.\n\nThe council didn't set a date for the end of the mission, known as the United\nNations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), in the two related\nresolutions that were approved in writing on the night of June 3 under new\nrules initiated because of the COVID-19 pandemic and formally adopted at a\nSecurity Council meeting in the morning of June 4.\n\nThe resolution, adopted by a vote of 15-0 extends the current 6,500-strong\nmission for six months until Dec. 31, 2020. It says the council will decide by\nthen on \"the responsible draw-down and exit of UNAMID,\" taking into account a\nspecial report from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the chair of\nthe African Union Commission.\n\nThat report, which is due by Oct. 31, should assess the situation on the\nground and include the impact of Sudan's peace process on the security\nsituation in Darfur and the capacity of the Sudanese government to protect\ncivilians, which is UNAMID's primary mandate, the resolution says.\n\nThe other resolution, also adopted by a 15-0 vote, establishes a new political\nmission, the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan\nto be known as UNITAMS, for an initial period of one year. It has the mandate\nto assist the country in its political transition toward democratic governance\nand in protecting and promoting human rights and sustainable peace.\n\nIt says UNITAMS should also assist the government in \"peacebuilding, civilian\nprotection, and rule of law, in particular in Darfur,\" provide technical\nassistance in drafting a constitution, and support peace negotiations and\nimplementation of any peace agreements if asked.\n\nThe Security Council asked Guterres to swiftly establish UNITAMS, with a view\nto reaching its full operational capacity as soon as possible so it can start\ndelivering on its mandates no later than Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nThe Darfur conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the\nArab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. The government in\nKhartoum was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and\nunleashing them on civilian populations-a charge it denies.\n\nIn recent years, as the result of a successful government military campaign,\nthe rebellion has been reduced to a rebel Sudan Liberation Army faction headed\nby Abdul Wahid Elnur in Jebel Marra.\n\nIn July 2018, the Security Council voted to dramatically cut the UNAMID force\nin response to reduced fighting and improved security conditions. The target\nthen was to end the mission on June 30, 2020.\n\nThe Darfur conflict took place under the three-decade autocratic rule of\nformer president Omar al-Bashir, during which Sudan was convulsed by bloody\ncivil war and rebellions, not only in Darfur but in the Blue Nile and South\nKordofan states. AlBashir's rule ended in April 2019 when the military ousted\nhim after mass street protests by a prodemocracy movement that began in late\n2018.\n\nA power-sharing agreement signed in August 2019 between the military and\nprotesters created a joint civilian-military ruling \"sovereign council,\" but\nthe civilians are struggling to assert authority in the face of the military's\npower.\n\nIn October 2019, the Security Council voted unanimously to keep UNAMID in\nDarfur for another year in hopes the new civilian-led transitional government\ncan restore peace.\n\nIt faces towering challenges, including the dire economic conditions that\nfueled the protests. Sudan's economy has been battered by civil wars and\ninternational sanctions. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has said achieving\npeace with armed groups is also crucial for the government as it would allow a\nreduction in military spending, which takes up to 80 percent of the budget.\n\nThe UNAMID resolution recognizes improvements in security conditions, \"while\nexpressing concern that the security situation in some regions of Darfur\nremains precarious.\" It underscores the need to protect peace-building gains\nin Darfur and \"avoid a relapse into conflict.\"\n\nThe resolution underscores that withdrawal of UNAMID \"should take into account\nthe progress made in the peace process,\" and supports the African Union Peace\nand Security Council's call \"for extreme caution in the withdrawal of UNAMID.\"\n\nThe UNAMID force was established in 2007, the first joint U.N.-AU peacekeeping\noperation. UNITAMS is a U.N.-only political mission, but the resolution\nunderlines \"the importance of the partnership between the United Nations and\nthe African Union in Sudan.\"\n\nThe UNAMID resolution recognizes the impact of the pandemic on its draw-down,\nand the UNITAMS resolution expresses \"grave concern\" at its impact on Sudan's\nhealth system and socioeconomic and humanitarian situation.\n\nBy Edith M. Lederer\n\nFrom The Associated Press\n\nThe Security Council asked Guterres to swiftly establish UNITAMS, with a view\nto reaching its full operational capacity as soon as possible so it can start\ndelivering on its mandates no later than Jan. 1, 2021.",

    "html": "<p><org>UNITED NATIONS-The U.N. Security Council</org> voted unanimously to move toward ending the joint <org>U.N.-African Union</org> peacekeeping force in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan's</location> vast western <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> region and replacing it with a civilian mission focusing on the country's democratic transition.</p>\n<p>The council didn't set a date for the end of the mission, known as the <org>United Nations-African Union Mission</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> (UNAMID), in the two related resolutions that were approved in writing on the night of <chron>June 3</chron> under new rules initiated because of the COVID-19 pandemic and formally adopted at a <org>Security Council</org> meeting in the morning of <chron>June 4</chron>.</p>\n<p>The resolution, adopted by a vote of 15-0 extends the current 6,500-strong mission for six months until <chron>Dec. 31, 2020</chron>. It says the council will decide by then on \"the responsible draw-down and exit of UNAMID,\" taking into account a special report from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">U.N</org>. Secretary-General <person>Antonio Guterres</person> and the chair of the <org>African Union Commission</org>.</p>\n<p>That report, which is due by <chron>Oct. 31</chron>, should assess the situation on the ground and include the impact of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan's</location> peace process on the security situation in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> and the capacity of the Sudanese government to protect civilians, which is UNAMID's primary mandate, the resolution says.</p>\n<p>The other resolution, also adopted by a 15-0 vote, establishes a new political mission, the <org>United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan</location> to be known as UNITAMS, for an initial period of one year. It has the mandate to assist the country in its political transition toward democratic governance and in protecting and promoting human rights and sustainable peace.</p>\n<p>It says UNITAMS should also assist the government in \"peacebuilding, civilian protection, and rule of law, in particular in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location>,\" provide technical assistance in drafting a constitution, and support peace negotiations and implementation of any peace agreements if asked.</p>\n<p><org>The Security Council</org> asked Guterres to swiftly establish UNITAMS, with a view to reaching its full operational capacity as soon as possible so it can start delivering on its mandates no later than <chron>Jan. 1, 2021</chron>.</p>\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. The government in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..khartm\">Khartoum</location> was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and unleashing them on civilian populations-a charge it denies.</p>\n<p>In recent years, as the result of a successful government military campaign, the rebellion has been reduced to a rebel <org>Sudan Liberation Army</org> faction headed by <person>Abdul Wahid Elnur</person> in Jebel Marra.</p>\n<p>In <chron>July 2018</chron>, the <org>Security Council</org> voted to dramatically cut the UNAMID force in response to reduced fighting and improved security conditions. The target then was to end the mission on <chron>June 30, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> conflict took place under the three-decade autocratic rule of former president <person>Omar al-Bashir</person>, during which <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan</location> was convulsed by bloody civil war and rebellions, not only in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> but in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states. AlBashir's rule ended in <chron>April 2019</chron> when the military ousted him after mass street protests by a prodemocracy movement that began in late 2018.</p>\n<p>A power-sharing agreement signed in <chron>August 2019</chron> between the military and protesters created a joint civilian-military ruling \"sovereign council,\" but the civilians are struggling to assert authority in the face of the military's power.</p>\n<p>In <chron>October 2019</chron>, the <org>Security Council</org> voted unanimously to keep UNAMID in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> for another year in hopes the new civilian-led transitional government can restore peace.</p>\n<p>It faces towering challenges, including the dire economic conditions that fueled the protests. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan's</location> economy has been battered by civil wars and international sanctions. Prime Minister <person>Abdalla Hamdok</person> has said achieving peace with armed groups is also crucial for the government as it would allow a reduction in military spending, which takes up to 80 percent of the budget.</p>\n<p>The UNAMID resolution recognizes improvements in security conditions, \"while expressing concern that the security situation in some regions of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> remains precarious.\" It underscores the need to protect peace-building gains in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/sd..darfur\">Darfur</location> and \"avoid a relapse into conflict.\"</p>\n<p>The resolution underscores that withdrawal of UNAMID \"should take into account the progress made in the peace process,\" and supports the <org>African Union Peace and Security Council's</org> call \"for extreme caution in the withdrawal of UNAMID.\"</p>\n<p>The UNAMID force was established in 2007, the first joint <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">U.N</org>.-AU peacekeeping operation. UNITAMS is a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">U.N</org>.-only political mission, but the resolution underlines \"the importance of the partnership between the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">United Nations</org> and the <org>African Union</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan</location>.\"</p>\n<p>The UNAMID resolution recognizes the impact of the pandemic on its draw-down, and the UNITAMS resolution expresses \"grave concern\" at its impact on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sd\">Sudan's</location> health system and socioeconomic and humanitarian situation.</p>\n<p>By <person>Edith M. Lederer</person></p>\n<p>From <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0174686754\">The Associated Press</org></p>\n\n<object class=\"mstar_text_entity\"><param name=\"mstar_entity_type\" value=\"Sidebar\" /><param name=\"mstar_entity_inline\" value=\"Y\" /><div class=\"Sidebar_content\">\n<p><org>The Security Council</org> asked Guterres to swiftly establish UNITAMS, with a view to reaching its full operational capacity as soon as possible so it can start delivering on its mandates no later than <chron>Jan. 1, 2021</chron>.</p>\n</div></object>",
