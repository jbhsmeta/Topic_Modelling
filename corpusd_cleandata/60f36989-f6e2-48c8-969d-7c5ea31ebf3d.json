    "text": "WASHINGTON, June 4 \\-- Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute,\nhas issued a public comment on the International Trade Administration's\nproposed rule entitled \"Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis System\". The\ncomment was written on May 29, 2020, and posted on June 1, 2020:\n\n* * *\n\nI am writing on behalf of the Beer Institute (BI), a trade association of\nbrewers, beer importers, and industry suppliers regarding the Department's\nproposal to establish a system of import licensing to facilitate the\nmonitoring of imports of aluminum articles, including monitoring for import\nsurges.\n\nThe United States beer industry is a heavy user of aluminum. Better than 60%\nof the beer manufactured and sold in this country comes in aluminum cans and\nbottles. We support the establishment of a system to check imports of aluminum\narticles into this country, albeit in a slightly different form from the\nsystem currently proposed.\n\nThe beer industry's experience with purchases of aluminum cans (body, end, and\ntab) since the implementation of the Section 232 tariff may be instructive as\nthe Department considers setting up a monitoring system. First, with the\nimplementation of tariffs, available supplies of scrap aluminum increased.\nAlthough increased use of lower-cost, tariff-exempt scrap would ordinarily\nlower the price of cansheet, the beer industry saw the opposite marketplace\nresponse with the tariff. The price of all aluminum cansheet, both imported\nand domestic, and premiums associated with purchase of cansheet increased.\nPrices have fallen since then, but because of slow demand for an expanding\nglobal glut of metal.\n\nSecond, with the implementation of tariffs, the beer industry, indeed the\nentire universe of U.S. end-users of aluminum, had to pay a specific premium,\nthe Midwest Premium Duty-Paid (MWP-DP), which includes a charge for the\ntariff. The MWP-DP is what producers, including cansheet manufacturers,\nrequire end-users to pay regardless of whether a tariff attaches to the metal.\nFor example, even though scrap, which is exempt from 232 tariffs, accounts for\n70% or more of the content of cansheet, the MWP-DP attaches to the whole\npurchase. Since March 2018, when Section 232 tariffs went into effect, the\nU.S. beverage industry bought 3.06 million mton of cansheet, the content of\nwhich was at least 70% tariff-exempt scrap. The U.S. beverage industry paid\n$582 million in tariffs on this cansheet, mostly factored as a part of the\nMWP-DP. The U.S. Government received only $81 million in actual tariff\npayments on these cansheet purchases. In other words, 86% of the Section 232\ntariffs built into the MWP-DP went to private parties, not the U.S.\nGovernment. Of the $582 million in Section 232 charges, $541 million or 86%\nwere also for non-tariffed metal, including scrap, domestic primary aluminum,\nor primary aluminum from Canada and other countries exempt from Section 232\ntariffs.\n\nThird, cansheet manufacturers shifted their production from the United States\nto other countries. The beer industry prefers buying domestically, but\ncansheet manufacturers saw lower-cost opportunities elsewhere. These changes\nwill increasingly affect the U.S. beer industry as domestic supply gives way\nto a less certain imported supply. Further to this point, while some importers\nof cansheet sought and received exclusions from Section 232 tariffs, end-users\nlike brewers still paid the MWP-DP and saw no benefit from those exclusions.\n\nFourth, as global production continues and manufacturing demands fall, we now\nsee efforts to prop up aluminum prices, including a declining Midwest Premium.\nFor example, earlier this month, S&P Global Platts suggested setting a \"floor\"\nfor the Midwest Premium to prevent it from falling into negative territory.\nAlthough opposition from BI and others caused S&P Global Platts to rethink\nthis plan, we know calls for the elimination of country exemptions and sharp\nrestrictions on Section 232 exclusions as well as requests for increases in\nSection 232 tariff rates are all designed to lead to the same result:\nincreased aluminum prices and premiums. We urge the Department to carefully\nassess the likely negative effects of each proposed change on aluminum\nendusers, particularly U.S. manufacturers already suffering the adverse\nimpacts of COVID-19 on their businesses.\n\nThe time has come for sunshine and facts. The United States needs a public\nsystem of monitoring and disclosure of aluminum imports. Instead of aggregate\ndisclosures, however, we recommend public disclosures showing who exactly is\nimporting what from where. A system of complete public disclosures will show\nfacts about the nature and extent of actual imports into this country. It\nwould also help end-users push back against the price gouging they currently\nexperience. Equally important, public disclosures will supply objective facts\nto use in assessing calls for further restrictions that may have harmful\nimpacts on end-users.\n\nThe Department should adopt a policy to publicly show import information in a\nspecific, not aggregate manner. Anything less will do little to address the\nproblems end-users of aluminum face both in terms of supply and tariff-\nburdened pricing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJim McGreevy\n\nPresident and CEO\n\n* * *\n\nThe proposed rule can be viewed at:\n<https://beta.regulations.gov/document/ITA_FRDOC_0001-6085>\n\nTARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism'\nnews briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and\nindividuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news\nreleases, reports, speeches.

    "title": "Beer Institute Issues Public Comment on International Trade Administration Proposed Rule",
    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">WASHINGTON</location>, <chron>June 4</chron> -- <person>Jim McGreevy</person>, president and CEO of the <org>Beer Institute</org>, has issued a public comment on the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0059630528\">International Trade Administration's</org> proposed rule entitled \"Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis System\". The comment was written on <chron>May 29, 2020</chron>, and posted on <chron>June 1, 2020</chron>:</p><p>* * *</p><p>I am writing on behalf of the <org>Beer Institute</org> (BI), a trade association of brewers, beer importers, and industry suppliers regarding the Department's proposal to establish a system of import licensing to facilitate the monitoring of imports of aluminum articles, including monitoring for import surges.</p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">The United States</location> beer industry is a heavy user of aluminum. Better than 60% of the beer manufactured and sold in this country comes in aluminum cans and bottles. We support the establishment of a system to check imports of aluminum articles into this country, albeit in a slightly different form from the system currently proposed.</p><p>The beer industry's experience with purchases of aluminum cans (body, end, and tab) since the implementation of the Section 232 tariff may be instructive as the Department considers setting up a monitoring system. First, with the implementation of tariffs, available supplies of scrap aluminum increased. Although increased use of lower-cost, tariff-exempt scrap would ordinarily lower the price of cansheet, the beer industry saw the opposite marketplace response with the tariff. The price of all aluminum cansheet, both imported and domestic, and premiums associated with purchase of cansheet increased. Prices have fallen since then, but because of slow demand for an expanding global glut of metal.</p><p>Second, with the implementation of tariffs, the beer industry, indeed the entire universe of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> end-users of aluminum, had to pay a specific premium, the Midwest Premium Duty-Paid (MWP-DP), which includes a charge for the tariff. The MWP-DP is what producers, including cansheet manufacturers, require end-users to pay regardless of whether a tariff attaches to the metal. For example, even though scrap, which is exempt from 232 tariffs, accounts for 70% or more of the content of cansheet, the MWP-DP attaches to the whole purchase. Since <chron>March 2018</chron>, when Section 232 tariffs went into effect, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> beverage industry bought 3.06 million mton of cansheet, the content of which was at least 70% tariff-exempt scrap. The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> beverage industry paid <money>$582 million</money> in tariffs on this cansheet, mostly factored as a part of the MWP-DP. The <org>U.S. Government</org> received only <money>$81 million</money> in actual tariff payments on these cansheet purchases. In other words, 86% of the Section 232 tariffs built into the MWP-DP went to private parties, not the <org>U.S. Government</org>. Of the <money>$582 million</money> in Section 232 charges, <money>$541 million</money> or 86% were also for non-tariffed metal, including scrap, domestic primary aluminum, or primary aluminum from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> and other countries exempt from Section 232 tariffs.</p><p>Third, cansheet manufacturers shifted their production from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> to other countries. The beer industry prefers buying domestically, but cansheet manufacturers saw lower-cost opportunities elsewhere. These changes will increasingly affect the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> beer industry as domestic supply gives way to a less certain imported supply. Further to this point, while some importers of cansheet sought and received exclusions from Section 232 tariffs, end-users like brewers still paid the MWP-DP and saw no benefit from those exclusions.</p><p>Fourth, as global production continues and manufacturing demands fall, we now see efforts to prop up aluminum prices, including a declining Midwest Premium. For example, earlier this month, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3794126178\">S&amp;P Global Platts</org> suggested setting a \"floor\" for the Midwest Premium to prevent it from falling into negative territory. Although opposition from BI and others caused <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3794126178\">S&amp;P Global Platts</org> to rethink this plan, we know calls for the elimination of country exemptions and sharp restrictions on Section 232 exclusions as well as requests for increases in Section 232 tariff rates are all designed to lead to the same result: increased aluminum prices and premiums. We urge the Department to carefully assess the likely negative effects of each proposed change on aluminum endusers, particularly <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> manufacturers already suffering the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses.</p><p>The time has come for sunshine and facts. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">The United States</location> needs a public system of monitoring and disclosure of aluminum imports. Instead of aggregate disclosures, however, we recommend public disclosures showing who exactly is importing what from where. A system of complete public disclosures will show facts about the nature and extent of actual imports into this country. It would also help end-users push back against the price gouging they currently experience. Equally important, public disclosures will supply objective facts to use in assessing calls for further restrictions that may have harmful impacts on end-users.</p><p>The Department should adopt a policy to publicly show import information in a specific, not aggregate manner. Anything less will do little to address the problems end-users of aluminum face both in terms of supply and tariff-burdened pricing.</p><p>Respectfully submitted,</p><p><person>Jim McGreevy</person></p><p>President and CEO</p><p>* * *</p><p>The proposed rule can be viewed at: <a href=\"https://beta.regulations.gov/document/ITA_FRDOC_0001-6085\">https://beta.regulations.gov/document/ITA_FRDOC_0001-6085</a></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.
