    "text": "Most diversity and inclusion (D&I) events in mining revolve around the topic\nof women in mining (WIM). National WIM establishments and chapters within\nprofessional organizations are discussing the issue, and its getting play at\nthe industrys biggest conferences: the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and\nExploration, the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada, Mining\nIndaba and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, just to name a few.\n\nFor some of these WIM organizations, the roots go back to being created as\nclubs of miners wives, with the main mandate to educate the public about\nmining while serving as a medium for the women in mining to lean on each\nother. This might have made sense decades ago. But today, the majority of\nthese WIM organizations serve important causes, are structured to promote\ngender diversity and support the young professional and student female\npopulation in choosing mining careers.\n\nBut one of the key challenges remains: with so much activity, why arent we\nseeing more progress in bridging the gender gap? Perhaps the name WIM,\nimplying exclusivity, is giving an unfair disservice to the cause? After all,\nWIM events often are wrongly perceived as women only, greatly limiting the\nnumber of allies in the industry. Shifting the dialogue from WIM to D&I\nbroadens the focus and addresses the underlying, fundamental issues of\nunconscious bias and stereotypes that often undermine inclusion.\n\nWhile brainstorming these challenges with Resa Furey more than a year ago -\nshe helped found the SME International Women in Mining session stream - we\nthought about the great value in empaneled industry legends who have strongly\nsupported the cause, bringing them together to raise awareness of D&I and its\nimportance, share practical advice for women to get ahead in their careers and\ninspire both female and male mining leaders. During the recent MineXchange\n2020 SME Annual Conference & Expo in Phoenix, we did just that.\n\nDuring their decades in corporate boardrooms, retired mining executives Tom\nAlbanese and Gary Goldberg never shied awat from championing broader gender\ndiversity and inclusion in an industry historically dominated by men.\n\nAlbanese, the former Rio Tinto and Vedanta Resources CEO now serving as Nevada\nCoppers lead independent director, and Goldberg - the former Newmont, Rio\nTinto Minerals and US Borax CEO recently appointed non-executive director of\nBHP - were joined by Emily King, CEO of Global Venture Consulting, the\nquintessential role model who rose through the ranks of the U.S. military as a\ngeologist leading explorations programs in Afghanistan and Middle East to\nsomeone who left that structured environment for riskier entrepreneurial\npursuits.\n\nProving that diversity and inclusion are more than buzzwords, Albanese,\nGoldberg and King naturally wish meaningful advancements for women to come\nsooner everywhere. Getting there is especially critical today, given that by\n2025 more than 75 percent of the global workforce will be millennials.\nImproving mining's culture on D&I is imperative in securing the best,\nbrightest talent.\n\nDuring the recent MineXchange conference, Furey and I explored these topics in\na panel discussion with Albanese, Goldberg and King.\n\nMain barriers to D&I in mining\n\nWhen we see that only about 15 percent of the global mining workforce is\nfemale, the first reaction by many is to think of mining as the least-\nprogressive industry out there. But as Albanese points out, \"Before we say\nmining is bad in this area, I think we have to usually recognize that we\nshould not be satisfied with it, but there is progress that's being made.\"\nDespite examples of women typically being underrepresented in the top ranks of\nother industries - from the military to consulting firms that, ironically,\ntell companies to be more diverse - the panel recognizes the mining industry's\nefforts to change and the need for that to continue.\n\nWhy does the gender topic remain as relevant as ever? Goldberg says it was\ncrystallized by one question he fielded during a town hall meeting in\nIndonesia. He recalled how the man among a couple hundred attendees bluntly\npressed him why such a push for empowerment was so important to him. Did he\nhave a defining encounter about gender in his youth? What was it?\n\n\"Why would you ignore half the world's population?\" Goldberg recalled\nresponding. \"And it shut that person down and the crowd got it, which I think\nis important.\"\n\nTo most, inclusion is a pretty easy concept to talk about but perhaps tougher\nto put into practice. Seen as a universal right, inclusion typically looks to\ngive equal opportunities and access to all people by embracing them regardless\nof race, gender, disability or other need.\n\n\"We've all been in positions in our careers or in life where we haven't felt\nincluded with the group,\" says Goldberg, recalling his days being hazed as a\nmaintenance person in a union mine as a summer hire and not feeling part of\nthat team. \"So it doesn't have to be that you're just female or just male or\nwhatever; it happens to all of us.\"\n\nUnconscious bias\n\nFurthering gender diversity also may require educating about unconscious\nbiases - those prevalent social stereotypes about groups that individuals form\noutside their own conscious awareness.\n\n\"The best leaders tend to surround themselves, supposedly, with people who\naren't just like them. That isn't always the case, though,\" Goldberg said,\nurging leaders to bring in individuals who prod them to think differently.\n\nUnconscious bias can be subtle, he notes, pointing to a colleague who told him\nshe always took thick pairs of socks to work sites because the boots were in\nmen's sizes and didn't fit her, forcing her to adjust her sock sizes to make\nthe footwear work.\n\nAlbanese recalled a female former Rio Tinto executive, widely considered a\nhard-driving taskmaster who held people accountable, expecting perfection.\nDuring a quarterly career discussion about up-andcomers in the company,\nAlbanese said, someone insisted that this woman \"didn't work well with the\nteam\" and was \"too hard on people.\"\n\n\"I asked the question, 'Wait a minute. If she was a man, you'd be saying she's\ndoing a great job,' Albanese said.\n\nHow can you close the gender gap quicker?\n\nBridging the gender gap starts at the top, with setting goals and aspirations\nin terms of what's expected of the organization. Albanese and Goldberg have\nadvocated for D&I for more than a decade, so what lessons can they share?\nGoldberg recommends starting with how you define inclusion. But, he added,\n\"The biggest surprise for me when we started implementing this at Newmont was\nhow much appetite people had\" with business resource groups and Women and\nAllies as the first ones endorsing gender diversity. Now, there are 24\nbusiness resource groups.\n\nIt's encouraging to hear that the natural demand for D&I is there. The\nindustry just needs roadmaps to unlocking the value and reaching its full\npotential.\n\nFormal programs and initiatives such as Paradigm for Parity - a coalition\nGoldberg and more than 100 other CEOs joined with the intent of closing their\nown corporate leadership gender gaps - is targeting having women in half of\nsenior leadership positions by the next decade. The coalition incrementally\nmeasures its progress and makes tweaks as needed.\n\nGoldberg holds that up as a blueprint for others seeking better D&I, calling\nit \"about substance, about how to get there.\"\n\nWhat about quotas and targets? Albanese reflects on how the push for more\nwomen on boards - something he's advocated for more than a decade - has seen\nan unforeseen consequence: The prospect of fewer women CEOs. His explanation:\nA lot of potential female CEO candidates, in a sort of senior executive rank,\nget pulled out of the executive roles for roles that tend to be more\nfamilyfriendly and flexible. \"It's a journey that we're still on, we're still\na long way from where we need to be,\" Albanese said.\n\nHe pondered that today, legal quotas are less important than they would have\nbeen in recent years. The reason: the environmental, social and governance\n(ESG) agenda. Whether it's global warming, communities or whatever, Albanese\nsubmits, the ESG agenda dominates a lot of the conversation among the large\ninstitutions that are the large shareholders to many of the companies. And if\nthe board in the United States, Australia or Canada \\- in a country with\nlegalized quotas or in a country without them - if that board does not have\nadequate diversity of their representation of board members, the investors are\n\"going to start knocking, and they're going to start putting pressure on those\ncompanies.\"\n\nSo \"the ESG agenda has become sort of front and center in terms of corporate\ngovernance, and that in itself, with or without legalized quotas, is actually\ndriving the same outcomes,\" he said. \"So for me, I see that quotas have had an\nunintended consequence, which is negative. I think it is an important part of\nthe toolkit, but it can't be the only part of the toolkit. It's a blunt\ninstrument.\"\n\nGoldberg adds: \"Whether you call it a quota or a target, people get into\ndebates over that, because quota just says you have to put in so many. So I\ndon't quite agree on the quota word,\" preferring to use the word \"targets.\"\nWhile Newmont's board is 40 percent females and one-third of the executive\nteam is female, just 15 percent of the company's workforce are women, compared\nto roughly 13 percent in the global mining industry.\n\nOne of the best examples of leading with aspirational targets in the industry\nhas been the example of BHP's target of reaching gender parity by 2025. While\nit may not be attainable by then, the effort draws you closer, serves as a\nbeacon of D&I leadership internally and sends a powerful message to the supply\nchain and service partners.\n\nWomen must step outside their comfort zone\n\nTo Albanese, broadening gender diversity is simply part of a country or\ncontinent's culture. Australia, he says, leads the way, because they\n\"recognize the importance of the diversity agenda but also have the people\nthat want to get into it.\" In Africa, he adds, mining is seen as a high-\nprestige role to which people aspire. There and in Australia, women - rather\nthan pursuing careers in computer science or pharmaceuticals - chase mining.\n\nAnd sometimes it's a company's culture that spurs gender diversity. BHP, the\nworld's largest mining company, recently celebrated completion of the\nEscondida Water Supply Expansion project in Chile, enabling the copper mine to\nmeet its water needs with desalinated ocean water, conserving groundwater\nsources for human use. As part of the project designed and engineered by Black\n& Veatch - a global infrastructure solutions leader that publicly has\ncommitted to diversity and inclusion - one-quarter of the workers were female,\nsupporting BHP's corporate goal of gender diversity.\n\nGoldberg suggests that companies \"leverage your leaders,\" talking about\ndiversity with employees over lunch or having their women leaders speak openly\nabout their experiences - and the biases they felt. And he encourages that\ncompanies encourage their senior employees to mentor or consult with coworkers\nsearching for different career paths.\n\n\"I've heard it said that women tend to need to tick all the boxes in terms of\nqualifications before they move on to the next role, where men may only have\n(to check) three of the 10\" Goldberg said. \"I think that's an excuse people\nuse to hold people back rather than really the right way to do things.\"\n\nAs founder and CEO of Global Venture Consulting, a natural resources firm\nspecializing in offering technology solutions to emerging and frontier\nmarkets, King said cultivating relationships with people who present\nopportunity and \"have your back\" are invaluable. But the onus is still on the\nwoman to deliver, along the way sorting out whether it fits in your family and\npersonal goals.\n\n\"I think that sometimes, you're looking for the company to provide\nopportunities for a mentor to pull you along,\" said King, a geologist serving\nas vice president of Women in Mining USA. \"And really when it comes down to\nit, it has to be something you want bad enough to figure out a way to get\nthere.\"\n\nAlbanese believes the responsibility cuts both ways. Companies must be\nsupportive with an agenda, policies and formalized mentoring in place to\npromote women. Conversely, women enthusiastically should \"step outside your\ncomfort zone\" and take on some career risk, embracing diverse responsibilities\nthat would make them viable candidates when the next CEO search comes around.\n\nIt takes a village and many volunteers' efforts to influence the status quo\nand traditional ways of not seeing the D&I topic as mission critical for the\nfuture success of the industry. SME, the oldest and most widely known mining\norganization in the United States is contributing to the progress through its\ninfluential network of industry volunteers, with several WiM and D&I sessions\nhaving been added to its annual convention in recent years.\n\nMost recently, the organization has created an ad hoc D&I committee with a\nmandate to learn best practices and advise about institutionalizing D&I within\nSME. That's progress in action.\n\nChanging the narrative from \"women in mining need all the help\" to \"let's\nraise awareness and fix the underlying D&I issues in mining\" will take time\nand effort. Educating both male and female mining leaders on the importance of\nthe issue, setting aspirational targets, providing roadmaps and best\npractices, and having access to platforms and forums to share the know-how and\ninspiration are all steps in the right direction.",

    "title": "Mining legends help bridge gender gap in an industry where only 15 percent are women",
    "html": "<p>Most diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) events in mining revolve around the topic of women in mining (WIM). National WIM establishments and chapters within professional organizations are discussing the issue, and its getting play at the industrys biggest conferences: the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2434181097\">Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration</org>, the <org>Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada</org>, Mining Indaba and the <org>Canadian Institute of Mining</org>, Metallurgy, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>For some of these WIM organizations, the roots go back to being created as clubs of miners wives, with the main mandate to educate the public about mining while serving as a medium for the women in mining to lean on each other. This might have made sense decades ago. But today, the majority of these WIM organizations serve important causes, are structured to promote gender diversity and support the young professional and student female population in choosing mining careers.</p>\n<p>But one of the key challenges remains: with so much activity, why arent we seeing more progress in bridging the gender gap? Perhaps the name WIM, implying exclusivity, is giving an unfair disservice to the cause? After all, WIM events often are wrongly perceived as women only, greatly limiting the number of allies in the industry. Shifting the dialogue from WIM to D&amp;I broadens the focus and addresses the underlying, fundamental issues of unconscious bias and stereotypes that often undermine inclusion.</p>\n<p>While brainstorming these challenges with <person>Resa Furey</person> more than a year ago - she helped found the SME International Women in Mining session stream - we thought about the great value in empaneled industry legends who have strongly supported the cause, bringing them together to raise awareness of D&amp;I and its importance, share practical advice for women to get ahead in their careers and inspire both female and male mining leaders. During the recent MineXchange 2020 SME Annual Conference &amp; Expo in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.az.phonix\">Phoenix</location>, we did just that.</p>\n<p>During their decades in corporate boardrooms, retired mining executives <person>Tom Albanese</person> and <person value=\"APIN:3436193079\">Gary Goldberg</person> never shied awat from championing broader gender diversity and inclusion in an industry historically dominated by men.</p>\n<p>Albanese, the former Rio Tinto and Vedanta Resources CEO now serving as Nevada Coppers lead independent director, and Goldberg - the former <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:NEM\">Newmont</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000174227\">Rio Tinto Minerals</org> and US Borax CEO recently appointed non-executive director of BHP - were joined by <person>Emily King</person>, CEO of <org>Global Venture Consulting</org>, the quintessential role model who rose through the ranks of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> military as a geologist leading explorations programs in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/mde\">Middle East</location> to someone who left that structured environment for riskier entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>\n<p>Proving that diversity and inclusion are more than buzzwords, Albanese, Goldberg and King naturally wish meaningful advancements for women to come sooner everywhere. Getting there is especially critical today, given that by 2025 more than 75 percent of the global workforce will be millennials. Improving mining's culture on D&amp;I is imperative in securing the best, brightest talent.</p>\n<p>During the recent MineXchange conference, Furey and I explored these topics in a panel discussion with Albanese, Goldberg and King.</p>\n<p>Main barriers to D&amp;I in mining</p>\n<p>When we see that only about 15 percent of the global mining workforce is female, the first reaction by many is to think of mining as the least-progressive industry out there. But as Albanese points out, \"Before we say mining is bad in this area, I think we have to usually recognize that we should not be satisfied with it, but there is progress that's being made.\" Despite examples of women typically being underrepresented in the top ranks of other industries - from the military to consulting firms that, ironically, tell companies to be more diverse - the panel recognizes the mining industry's efforts to change and the need for that to continue.</p>\n<p>Why does the gender topic remain as relevant as ever? Goldberg says it was crystallized by one question he fielded during a town hall meeting in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location>. He recalled how the man among a couple hundred attendees bluntly pressed him why such a push for empowerment was so important to him. Did he have a defining encounter about gender in his youth? What was it?</p>\n<p>\"Why would you ignore half the world's population?\" Goldberg recalled responding. \"And it shut that person down and the crowd got it, which I think is important.\"</p>\n<p>To most, inclusion is a pretty easy concept to talk about but perhaps tougher to put into practice. Seen as a universal right, inclusion typically looks to give equal opportunities and access to all people by embracing them regardless of race, gender, disability or other need.</p>\n<p>\"We've all been in positions in our careers or in life where we haven't felt included with the group,\" says Goldberg, recalling his days being hazed as a maintenance person in a union mine as a summer hire and not feeling part of that team. \"So it doesn't have to be that you're just female or just male or whatever; it happens to all of us.\"</p>\n<p>Unconscious bias</p>\n<p>Furthering gender diversity also may require educating about unconscious biases - those prevalent social stereotypes about groups that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness.</p>\n<p>\"The best leaders tend to surround themselves, supposedly, with people who aren't just like them. That isn't always the case, though,\" Goldberg said, urging leaders to bring in individuals who prod them to think differently.</p>\n<p>Unconscious bias can be subtle, he notes, pointing to a colleague who told him she always took thick pairs of socks to work sites because the boots were in men's sizes and didn't fit her, forcing her to adjust her sock sizes to make the footwear work.</p>\n<p>Albanese recalled a female former Rio Tinto executive, widely considered a hard-driving taskmaster who held people accountable, expecting perfection. During a quarterly career discussion about up-andcomers in the company, Albanese said, someone insisted that this woman \"didn't work well with the team\" and was \"too hard on people.\"</p>\n<p>\"I asked the question, 'Wait a minute. If she was a man, you'd be saying she's doing a great job,' Albanese said.</p>\n<p>How can you close the gender gap quicker?</p>\n<p>Bridging the gender gap starts at the top, with setting goals and aspirations in terms of what's expected of the organization. Albanese and Goldberg have advocated for D&amp;I for more than a decade, so what lessons can they share? Goldberg recommends starting with how you define inclusion. But, he added, \"The biggest surprise for me when we started implementing this at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:NEM\">Newmont</org> was how much appetite people had\" with business resource groups and Women and Allies as the first ones endorsing gender diversity. Now, there are 24 business resource groups.</p>\n<p>It's encouraging to hear that the natural demand for D&amp;I is there. The industry just needs roadmaps to unlocking the value and reaching its full potential.</p>\n<p>Formal programs and initiatives such as Paradigm for Parity - a coalition Goldberg and more than 100 other CEOs joined with the intent of closing their own corporate leadership gender gaps - is targeting having women in half of senior leadership positions by the next decade. The coalition incrementally measures its progress and makes tweaks as needed.</p>\n<p>Goldberg holds that up as a blueprint for others seeking better D&amp;I, calling it \"about substance, about how to get there.\"</p>\n<p>What about quotas and targets? Albanese reflects on how the push for more women on boards - something he's advocated for more than a decade - has seen an unforeseen consequence: The prospect of fewer women CEOs. His explanation: A lot of potential female CEO candidates, in a sort of senior executive rank, get pulled out of the executive roles for roles that tend to be more familyfriendly and flexible. \"It's a journey that we're still on, we're still a long way from where we need to be,\" Albanese said.</p>\n<p>He pondered that today, legal quotas are less important than they would have been in recent years. The reason: the environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda. Whether it's global warming, communities or whatever, Albanese submits, the ESG agenda dominates a lot of the conversation among the large institutions that are the large shareholders to many of the companies. And if the board in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> - in a country with legalized quotas or in a country without them - if that board does not have adequate diversity of their representation of board members, the investors are \"going to start knocking, and they're going to start putting pressure on those companies.\"</p>\n<p>So \"the ESG agenda has become sort of front and center in terms of corporate governance, and that in itself, with or without legalized quotas, is actually driving the same outcomes,\" he said. \"So for me, I see that quotas have had an unintended consequence, which is negative. I think it is an important part of the toolkit, but it can't be the only part of the toolkit. It's a blunt instrument.\"</p>\n<p>Goldberg adds: \"Whether you call it a quota or a target, people get into debates over that, because quota just says you have to put in so many. So I don't quite agree on the quota word,\" preferring to use the word \"targets.\" While <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:NEM\">Newmont's</org> board is 40 percent females and one-third of the executive team is female, just 15 percent of the company's workforce are women, compared to roughly 13 percent in the global mining industry.</p>\n<p>One of the best examples of leading with aspirational targets in the industry has been the example of BHP's target of reaching gender parity by 2025. While it may not be attainable by then, the effort draws you closer, serves as a beacon of D&amp;I leadership internally and sends a powerful message to the supply chain and service partners.</p>\n<p>Women must step outside their comfort zone</p>\n<p>To Albanese, broadening gender diversity is simply part of a country or continent's culture. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, he says, leads the way, because they \"recognize the importance of the diversity agenda but also have the people that want to get into it.\" In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/afr\">Africa</location>, he adds, mining is seen as a high-prestige role to which people aspire. There and in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, women - rather than pursuing careers in computer science or pharmaceuticals - chase mining.</p>\n<p>And sometimes it's a company's culture that spurs gender diversity. BHP, the world's largest mining company, recently celebrated completion of the Escondida Water Supply Expansion project in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cl\">Chile</location>, enabling the copper mine to meet its water needs with desalinated ocean water, conserving groundwater sources for human use. As part of the project designed and engineered by Black &amp; Veatch - a global infrastructure solutions leader that publicly has committed to diversity and inclusion - one-quarter of the workers were female, supporting BHP's corporate goal of gender diversity.</p>\n<p>Goldberg suggests that companies \"leverage your leaders,\" talking about diversity with employees over lunch or having their women leaders speak openly about their experiences - and the biases they felt. And he encourages that companies encourage their senior employees to mentor or consult with coworkers searching for different career paths.</p>\n<p>\"I've heard it said that women tend to need to tick all the boxes in terms of qualifications before they move on to the next role, where men may only have (to check) three of the 10\" Goldberg said. \"I think that's an excuse people use to hold people back rather than really the right way to do things.\"</p>\n<p>As founder and CEO of <org>Global Venture Consulting</org>, a natural resources firm specializing in offering technology solutions to emerging and frontier markets, King said cultivating relationships with people who present opportunity and \"have your back\" are invaluable. But the onus is still on the woman to deliver, along the way sorting out whether it fits in your family and personal goals.</p>\n<p>\"I think that sometimes, you're looking for the company to provide opportunities for a mentor to pull you along,\" said King, a geologist serving as vice president of Women in <org>Mining USA</org>. \"And really when it comes down to it, it has to be something you want bad enough to figure out a way to get there.\"</p>\n<p>Albanese believes the responsibility cuts both ways. Companies must be supportive with an agenda, policies and formalized mentoring in place to promote women. Conversely, women enthusiastically should \"step outside your comfort zone\" and take on some career risk, embracing diverse responsibilities that would make them viable candidates when the next CEO search comes around.</p>\n<p>It takes a village and many volunteers' efforts to influence the status quo and traditional ways of not seeing the D&amp;I topic as mission critical for the future success of the industry. SME, the oldest and most widely known mining organization in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> is contributing to the progress through its influential network of industry volunteers, with several WiM and D&amp;I sessions having been added to its annual convention in recent years.</p>\n<p>Most recently, the organization has created an ad hoc D&amp;I committee with a mandate to learn best practices and advise about institutionalizing D&amp;I within SME. That's progress in action.</p>\n<p>Changing the narrative from \"women in mining need all the help\" to \"let's raise awareness and fix the underlying D&amp;I issues in mining\" will take time and effort. Educating both male and female mining leaders on the importance of the issue, setting aspirational targets, providing roadmaps and best practices, and having access to platforms and forums to share the know-how and inspiration are all steps in the right direction.</p>",
