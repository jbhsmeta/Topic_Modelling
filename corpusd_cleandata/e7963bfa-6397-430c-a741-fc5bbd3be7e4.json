    "text": "the women of Bravo's wildly popular \"Real Housewives\" franchise are known for\nliving large, and the Dallas mansion of the franchise's pink-obsessed\nsocialite star Kameron Westcott, now available at just over $5.1 million, is\nno exception. Built on a one-quarter-acre corner parcel in the prestigious\ntown of Highland Park, which sits within the city of Dallas, the slightly more\nthan 7,400-square-foot Tuscan-inspired mansion has a formal exterior that\nbelies the girlishly glammed-up, bubblegumpink interior decor. Listings held\nby Kelli Macatee of Compass show the three-level, elevator-equipped residence\ncontains a half dozen bedrooms and a total of six full and two half bathrooms.\n\nJust inside the steel-and-glass front door, an office/library is painted\nWestcott's signature shade, while a pink-hued portrait of Marilyn Monroe is\njust one of the several pink-dominant art pieces that enliven the formal\ndining room. The marble-countered kitchen is open to an informal dining space\nwith dark-pink upholstered chairs, and in the adjoining family room, anchored\nby a carved-stone fireplace under a groinvaulted ceiling, a giant retractable\nwall of glass opens to the backyard. The basement is done up in a bordello-\ninspired bloodred-and-black color scheme and contains a kitchenette/wet bar, a\nwine tasting nook and a plush screening room.\n\nThough the familiar adage boasts that \"everything is bigger in Texas,\"\nWestcott's high-walled backyard isn't especially large. It is, however,\ndesigned for relaxed outdoor living, with an arched loggia that includes a TV-\nsurmounted fireplace and an outdoor kitchen with marble countertops. A lagoon-\nlike swimming pool and spa is picturesquely set against a tumble of boulders\nand a green wall of foliage.\n\nProducer Bob Yari Lists His L.A. Contemporary\n\nAn opulent contemporary residence just off uber-trendy Melrose Avenue in\nL.A.'s popular Beverly Grove neighborhood has come for sale with a price tag\njust under $4.7 million. Now listed with Dustin Nicholas at Nicholas Property\nGroup, the concrete-and-glass pavilion was for sale last year at $4.9 million\nand, earlier this year, for rent at $21,000 per month. Owned through a\ncorporate concern controlled by shopping mall magnate-turned-indie film and\ntelevision producer Bob Yari \\- his recent credits include the TV series\n\"Yellowstone\" and the 2015 silver-screen dud \"Papa Hemingway in Cuba\" - the\nbrandnew Beverly Hills-sized home measures in at roughly 6,000 square feet\nover three floors with five en suite bedrooms and a total of seven bathrooms.\n\nAiry, clean-lined and light-filled interior spaces feature honey-toned\nhardwood floors, huge floor-to-ceiling windows and two massive double-sided\nfireplaces sheathed in boldly veined and cleverly bookmatched slabs of black\nand white marble. The sleek, expensively accoutered kitchen is open to\nadjoining living and dining rooms that flow easily out to the backyard. In\naddition to a guest or staff bedroom, an extensive subterranean level offers a\nlounge/media room, a professional bar and a climate-controlled wine cellar\nbehind floor-to-ceiling sheets of glass.\n\nOutdoor spaces include a sunbaked roof terrace with spa tub and wraparound\ncity and mountain views. The not particularly large but privately hedged\nbackyard manages to comfortably accommodate a plunge-sized saltwater swimming\npool and a poolside cabana.\n\nFanning Sisters Set Sale in Valley Village\n\nA low-key but luxurious home in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, owned, according\nto well-informed sources, by actor sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning, has come\nto market at almost $2.7 million. The former child actors, who have both gone\non to grown-up success, purchased the property about three years ago for $2.3\nmillion. Described in listings held by Robert Walters of Leland Properties as\nan East Coast Transitional-style home, the residence is hidden down a private,\ngated lane in the rapidly gentrifying Valley Village area, with six bedrooms\nand 5.5 bathrooms in just under 4,600 square feet.\n\nFlanked by white rosebushes, the front door opens into a wide central gallery\nthat connects the various areas of the twostory residence. A marble-faced\nfireplace anchors the formal living room, and the formal dining room is\nwrapped in babyblue brocade-patterned wallpaper. At the back of the house, a\nhigh-end kitchen is open to a sunny breakfast nook and family room where glass\nsliders abut a covered patio. On the upper level, the master suite is replete\nwith a fireplace, large terrace, walk-in closet and all-white bathroom.\n\nThe lushly planted backyard is privatized with hedgerows and equipped with a\nsound system. A covered patio overlooks a built-in grill and a dark-bottomed\nswimming pool and spa. (C)",

    "html": "<p>the women of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/mx.mi.bravo\">Bravo's</location> wildly popular \"Real Housewives\" franchise are known for living large, and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.dallas\">Dallas</location> mansion of the franchise's pink-obsessed socialite star <person>Kameron Westcott</person>, now available at just over <money>$5.1 million</money>, is no exception. Built on a one-quarter-acre corner parcel in the prestigious town of <location>Highland Park</location>, which sits within the city of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.dallas\">Dallas</location>, the slightly more than 7,400-square-foot Tuscan-inspired mansion has a formal exterior that belies the girlishly glammed-up, bubblegumpink interior decor. Listings held by <person>Kelli Macatee</person> of Compass show the three-level, elevator-equipped residence contains a half dozen bedrooms and a total of six full and two half bathrooms.</p>\n<p>Just inside the steel-and-glass front door, an office/library is painted Westcott's signature shade, while a pink-hued portrait of <person>Marilyn Monroe</person> is just one of the several pink-dominant art pieces that enliven the formal dining room. The marble-countered kitchen is open to an informal dining space with dark-pink upholstered chairs, and in the adjoining family room, anchored by a carved-stone fireplace under a groinvaulted ceiling, a giant retractable wall of glass opens to the backyard. The basement is done up in a bordello-inspired bloodred-and-black color scheme and contains a kitchenette/wet bar, a wine tasting nook and a plush screening room.</p>\n<p>Though the familiar adage boasts that \"everything is bigger in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>,\" Westcott's high-walled backyard isn't especially large. It is, however, designed for relaxed outdoor living, with an arched loggia that includes a TV-surmounted fireplace and an outdoor kitchen with marble countertops. A lagoon-like swimming pool and spa is picturesquely set against a tumble of boulders and a green wall of foliage.</p>\n<p>Producer Bob Yari Lists His L.A. Contemporary</p>\n<p>An opulent contemporary residence just off &#252;ber-trendy <location>Melrose Avenue</location> in L.A.'s popular <location>Beverly Grove</location> neighborhood has come for sale with a price tag just under <money>$4.7 million</money>. Now listed with <person>Dustin Nicholas</person> at <org>Nicholas Property Group</org>, the concrete-and-glass pavilion was for sale last year at <money>$4.9 million</money> and, earlier this year, for rent at <money>$21,000</money> per month. Owned through a corporate concern controlled by shopping mall magnate-turned-indie film and television producer <person>Bob Yari</person> - his recent credits include the TV series \"Yellowstone\" and the 2015 silver-screen dud \"<person>Papa Hemingway</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cu\">Cuba</location>\" - the brandnew <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.bevlls\">Beverly Hills</location>-sized home measures in at roughly 6,000 square feet over three floors with five en suite bedrooms and a total of seven bathrooms.</p>\n<p>Airy, clean-lined and light-filled interior spaces feature honey-toned hardwood floors, huge floor-to-ceiling windows and two massive double-sided fireplaces sheathed in boldly veined and cleverly bookmatched slabs of black and white marble. The sleek, expensively accoutered kitchen is open to adjoining living and dining rooms that flow easily out to the backyard. In addition to a guest or staff bedroom, an extensive subterranean level offers a lounge/media room, a professional bar and a climate-controlled wine cellar behind floor-to-ceiling sheets of glass.</p>\n<p>Outdoor spaces include a sunbaked roof terrace with spa tub and wraparound city and mountain views. The not particularly large but privately hedged backyard manages to comfortably accommodate a plunge-sized saltwater swimming pool and a poolside cabana.</p>\n<p>Fanning Sisters Set Sale in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.valage\">Valley Village</location></p>\n<p>A low-key but luxurious home in L.A.'s <location>San Fernando Valley</location>, owned, according to well-informed sources, by actor sisters Dakota and <person>Elle Fanning</person>, has come to market at almost <money>$2.7 million</money>. The former child actors, who have both gone on to grown-up success, purchased the property about three years ago for <money>$2.3 million</money>. Described in listings held by <person>Robert Walters</person> of <org>Leland Properties</org> as an East Coast Transitional-style home, the residence is hidden down a private, gated lane in the rapidly gentrifying <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.valage\">Valley Village</location> area, with six bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in just under 4,600 square feet.</p>\n<p>Flanked by white rosebushes, the front door opens into a wide central gallery that connects the various areas of the twostory residence. A marble-faced fireplace anchors the formal living room, and the formal dining room is wrapped in babyblue brocade-patterned wallpaper. At the back of the house, a high-end kitchen is open to a sunny breakfast nook and family room where glass sliders abut a covered patio. On the upper level, the master suite is replete with a fireplace, large terrace, walk-in closet and all-white bathroom.</p>\n<p>The lushly planted backyard is privatized with hedgerows and equipped with a sound system. A covered patio overlooks a built-in grill and a dark-bottomed swimming pool and spa. &#169;</p>",
