    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted manufacturing industry across the world.\nWith machinery being the cornerstone of economic development and progress,\ncountries have realized the need for industry upgradation.\n\nTaiwan's Smart Machinery Industry enjoys a sterling reputation globally\nbecause of its ability to deliver outstanding products at competitive prices.\nWith stress on quality, price and service, the industry is known for its\nsignificant precision technology and massive ICT integration.\n\nTo better understand the importance of the smart machinery and manufacturing\nsolutions, the Taiwan Excellence held the 'Taiwan Excellence Smart Machinery'\ne-conference with the aim to attract and familiarize global buyers with\nTaiwanese Smart Machinery. Taiwan Excellence is an international campaign to\npromote Taiwan's superior products. The e-conference was participated by eight\nof Taiwan's most reputed smart machinery companies showcasing their advanced\nsmart manufacturing solutions in a bid to assist global manufacturers in\nmanaging industry upgrade and automation. The brands included iconic names\nlike Chin Fong, FFG (Feeler), Grintimate, HIWIN, Manford, Solomon, She Hong\n(Hartford) and Tongtai.\n\nThe conference showcased the companies' products and solutions including\nprecision components, digitally-controlled machine tools, automation equipment\nand smart controlling systems. A new concept 'Taiwan Excellence Smart\nMachinery Virtual Pavilion' was also launched at the conference, which\ndisplayed 60 innovative Smart Machinery products from 50 Taiwan Excellence\nbrands. To add to the experience, buyers could also check out superb smart\nmachinery products anytime and anywhere. At a time when most physical\nexhibitions are being postponed, digitalizing the Taiwan Excellence Pavilion\nand usage of VR technique means buyers can virtually check products without\ngraphic restrictions.\n\nFor countries like India, the e-conference aimed to bolster the image of\nTaiwan's Smart Machinery industry as a major global supplier of machine tools,\nequipment and key components. India is an attractive option for Taiwanese\ncompanies who have the potential to play a catalyzing role. Also, in the\ncurrent situation, as industries grapple with loss of migrant labor and in\nsome cases, spread of the Covid-19 through human to human contact, the need\nfor solutions to counter the absence of human supervision is very high.\nTaiwan's Automated Smart Machinery with zero human intervention will play a\nvital role in both the scenario.\n\nAccording to a study published by 'Markets and Markets', the smart\nmanufacturing market is expected to increase from US$214.7 billion in 2020 to\nUS$384.8 billion in 2025, growing at a CAGR (Compound Average Growth Rate) of\n12.4 percent. However, to aid this growth in these tumultuous times, the\nformidable expertise of Taiwanese Smart Machinery companies can go a long way\nby augmenting indigenous capacity and plugging gaps in manufacturing solutions\nglobally. Besides, countries will now increasingly have to turn to smart\nautomation to manage supply chains and production functions as the need for\nsocial distancing will make human intervention and supervision difficult.\n\nThe world caught a glimpse of the Taiwanese industry's rapid response\ncapabilities and flexible management when it completed the herculean task of\nestablishing 92 mask production lines in 40 days, and boosted mask production\nfrom 1.88 million pieces a day to 17 million pieces a day. Along with\ndemonstrating proficiency, this feat also established Taiwan as one of the\nbest options for reviving the world's manufacturing industry.\n\nChin Fong, one of the world's top four press makers, shared how it applies\nsmart concepts to its press machines for better performance and service life.\n\nGrintimate demonstrated how it applies a unique hydrostatic technique in\ngrinding solutions in order to simplify the production of automotive drive\nshafts.\n\nFFG, one of the world's top three machine tool group, and the largest machine\ntool maker in Taiwan, showcased its solutions for automatic production in the\nautomotive industry for improving the efficiency and flexibility of the\nproduction line.\n\nHIWIN, the world's No.2 in market share in the field of linear transmission,\nintroduced its precision components which are able to deliver higher\nperformance for automation equipment, with high accuracy and durability.\n\nManford displayed a new energy-saving machining solution that will effectively\nreduce the use of electricity by 80 percent, lubrication oil by 90 percent,\nand still maintain (extremely) high performance.\n\nSolomon demonstrated how its 3D vision technology can help automation\nequipment to make complex and precise pick-and-place tasks.\n\nShe-Hong, the largest machining center manufacturer in Taiwan, introduced the\n\"Hartrol Premium\" smart controller. Its friendly interface and easy operation\nallow operators to monitor and manage production more efficiently.\n\nTongtai presented an outstanding solution for smart manufacturing and share\nsome examples to show how they help customers construct flexible production\nlines.\n\nSpeaking about the conference, Walter Yeh, CEO & President, TAITRA, said, \"The\nCOVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of industry upgradation,\nautomation, and accelerated import-related solutions. We have demonstrated how\nTaiwan's award-winning companies can assist by providing innovative solutions\nto meet manufacturing demands in the post-pandemic era. These companies will\nbecome reliable partners in the global industry upgrade. Taiwan Excellence\nwill continue to present the best of Taiwanese technologies to the world even\nduring these difficult times.\"\n\nMr. Guann-Jyh Lee, Deputy Director General, Bureau of Foreign Trade, MOEA\nsaid, \"Once the COVID-19 pandemic situation slowly starts stabilizing,\nindustries around the world will gradually resume their economic activities.\nThey will need to deploy smart manufacturing solutions to avert similar losses\nin the future. Taiwan can be the best choice for this industrial upgradation\nand to help revitalize the manufacturing communities in the post-pandemic\nperiod.\"\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nHenry Chen, Project Manager of Solomon Tech; Andy Hung, Director of FFG; Jacy\nLin, Oversea Sales of Manford; Guann-Jyh Lee, Deputy Director General of BOFT,\nMOEA; Walter M.

    "html": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted manufacturing industry across\nthe world. With machinery being the cornerstone of economic development\nand progress, countries have realized the need for industry upgradation.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan's</location> Smart Machinery Industry enjoys a sterling reputation\nglobally because of its ability to deliver outstanding products at\ncompetitive prices. With stress on quality, price and service, the\nindustry is known for its significant precision technology and massive\nICT integration.</p>\n\n<p>To better understand the importance of the smart machinery and\nmanufacturing solutions, the Taiwan Excellence held the 'Taiwan\nExcellence Smart Machinery' e-conference with the aim to attract\nand familiarize global buyers with <org>Taiwanese Smart Machinery</org>. Taiwan\nExcellence is an international campaign to promote <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan's</location>\nsuperior products. The e-conference was participated by eight of\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan's</location> most reputed smart machinery companies showcasing their\nadvanced smart manufacturing solutions in a bid to assist global\nmanufacturers in managing industry upgrade and automation. The brands\nincluded iconic names like <person>Chin Fong</person>, FFG (Feeler), Grintimate, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Taiwan:2049\">HIWIN</org>,\nManford, Solomon, She <person>Hong (Hartford)</person> and Tongtai.</p>\n\n<p>The conference showcased the companies' products and solutions\nincluding precision components, digitally-controlled machine tools,\nautomation equipment and smart controlling systems. A new concept\n'Taiwan Excellence Smart Machinery Virtual Pavilion' was also\nlaunched at the conference, which displayed 60 innovative <org>Smart\nMachinery</org> products from 50 Taiwan Excellence brands. To add to the\nexperience, buyers could also check out superb smart machinery products\nanytime and anywhere. At a time when most physical exhibitions are being\npostponed, digitalizing the <location>Taiwan Excellence Pavilion</location> and usage of VR\ntechnique means buyers can virtually check products without graphic\nrestrictions.</p>\n\n<p>For countries like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>, the e-conference aimed to bolster the\nimage of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan's</location> <org>Smart Machinery</org> industry as a major global\nsupplier of machine tools, equipment and key components. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> is an\nattractive option for Taiwanese companies who have the potential to play\na catalyzing role. Also, in the current situation, as industries grapple\nwith loss of migrant labor and in some cases, spread of the Covid-19\nthrough human to human contact, the need for solutions to counter the\nabsence of human supervision is very high. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan's</location> <org>Automated Smart\nMachinery</org> with zero human intervention will play a vital role in both\nthe scenario.</p>\n\n<p>According to a study published by 'Markets and Markets',\nthe smart manufacturing market is expected to increase from <money>US$214.7\nbillion</money> in 2020 to <money>US$384.8 billion</money> in 2025, growing at a CAGR (Compound\nAverage Growth Rate) of 12.4 percent. However, to aid this growth in\nthese tumultuous times, the formidable expertise of <org>Taiwanese Smart\nMachinery</org> companies can go a long way by augmenting indigenous capacity\nand plugging gaps in manufacturing solutions globally. Besides,\ncountries will now increasingly have to turn to smart automation to\nmanage supply chains and production functions as the need for social\ndistancing will make human intervention and supervision difficult.</p>\n\n<p>The world caught a glimpse of the Taiwanese industry's rapid\nresponse capabilities and flexible management when it completed the\nherculean task of establishing 92 mask production lines in 40 days, and\nboosted mask production from 1.88 million pieces a day to 17 million\npieces a day. Along with demonstrating proficiency, this feat also\nestablished <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan</location> as one of the best options for reviving the\nworld's manufacturing industry.</p>\n\n<p><person>Chin Fong</person>, one of the world's top four press makers, shared\nhow it applies smart concepts to its press machines for better\nperformance and service life.</p>\n\n<p>Grintimate demonstrated how it applies a unique hydrostatic\ntechnique in grinding solutions in order to simplify the production of\nautomotive drive shafts.</p>\n\n<p>FFG, one of the world's top three machine tool group, and the\nlargest machine tool maker in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan</location>, showcased its solutions for\nautomatic production in the automotive industry for improving the\nefficiency and flexibility of the production line.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Taiwan:2049\">HIWIN</org>, the world's No.2 in market share in the field of linear\ntransmission, introduced its precision components which are able to\ndeliver higher performance for automation equipment, with high accuracy\nand durability.</p>\n\n<p>Manford displayed a new energy-saving machining solution that will\neffectively reduce the use of electricity by 80 percent, lubrication oil\nby 90 percent, and still maintain (extremely) high performance.</p>\n\n<p>Solomon demonstrated how its 3D vision technology can help\nautomation equipment to make complex and precise pick-and-place tasks.</p>\n\n<p>She-Hong, the largest machining center manufacturer in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan</location>,\nintroduced the \"Hartrol Premium\" smart controller. Its\nfriendly interface and easy operation allow operators to monitor and\nmanage production more efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>Tongtai presented an outstanding solution for smart manufacturing\nand share some examples to show how they help customers construct\nflexible production lines.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking about the conference, <person>Walter Yeh</person>, CEO &amp; President,\nTAITRA, said, \"The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of\nindustry upgradation, automation, and accelerated import-related\nsolutions. We have demonstrated how <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tw\">Taiwan's</location> award-winning\ncompanies can assist by providing innovative solutions to meet\nmanufacturing demands in the post-pandemic era.
