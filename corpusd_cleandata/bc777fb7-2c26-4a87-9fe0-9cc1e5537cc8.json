    "text": "Although Wilson Borough police were already there, a 21-year-old Easton man\ncame to a home Sunday night in the 2300 block of Second Street to threaten and\nthen strike another man, court papers say.\n\nXeane Germaine Allen, of the 1400 block of Washington Street, made the threat\nabout 9:15 p.m. then closed in on the other man, police said. Officers tried\nto hold Allen back but he reached around an officer and punched the victim in\nthe jaw, police said. While trying to get a punch off over Patrolman James\nSiegfried, Allen's fist struck the officer in the left side of the head,\npolice said.\n\nAllen was arraigned at 7:15 a.m. Monday before District Judge Patricia\nBroscius on charges of aggravated assault on a police officer, simple assault\nand harassment, police said.\n\nHe was released when PreTrial Services added a 10% option to his $10,000 bail,\nrecords say. The judge had approved the possibility for the 10% option,\nrecords show.\n\nAllen's preliminary hearing is tentatively scheduled 9 a.m. June 12 in\nDistrict Judge Richard Yetter III's court in the borough. Allen does not have\na listed phone number, so he couldn't be reached for comment, and court papers\ndon't list an attorney for him.",
