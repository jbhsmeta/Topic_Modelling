Spann, 39, also of Bridgeton, is charged with murder in the death\nof Tracy L. DuBois, 37, whose body was found along the banks of the Cohansey\nRiver on May 22.\n\nHe allegedly killed DuBois at a vacant warehouse on Grove Street in Bridgeton\nfollowing an argument over \"another male,\" according to his criminal\ncomplaint.\n\nTwo witnesses told police that Spann and DuBois, who were described by police\nas acquaintances, argued in the warehouse on the night of May 21 and that the\ndispute turned violent.\n\nThe witnesses then left the warehouse for the night, they told investigators.\n\nAs the fight continued, Spann \"described himself as blacking out, beating and\nchoking the victim until she became unconscious,\" according to his affidavit\nof probable cause.\n\nSpann told police he then left the warehouse and later returned, when he\ndragged her body across the property to the nearby riverbank.\n\nHe also admitted finding the two witnesses in downtown Bridgeton the next\nmorning and asking them to help him move the body \"to conceal it further.\"\n\nActing on a tip, police recovered the victim's body that morning and arrested\nSpann the same day.\n\nWhen officers approached him, his hands were covered in blood, according to\nthe affidavit. He also had two cuts to his left hand, which was described as\n\"excessively swollen,\" and had blood on his clothing, police said.\n\nIn addition to murder, Spann was charged with desecration of human remains,\ntampering with physical evidence, obstruction and theft. He allegedly took the\nvictim's purse after the killing.\n\nSpann remains in Cumberland County Jail pending a detention hearing, which is\nslated for June 9.\n\nDuBois was born in Bridgeton and was a Bridgeton High School graduate,\naccording to her obituary.\n\nMatt Gray, NJ Advance Media, mgray @njadvancemedia.com.",
