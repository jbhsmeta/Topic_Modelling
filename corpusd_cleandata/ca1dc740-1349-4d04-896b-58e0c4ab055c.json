    "text": "Oklahoma City: Oklahoma Department of Rehabilitation Services has issued the\nfollowing news release:\n\nwill mark the 100th anniversary of the Vocational Rehabilitation, the\nemployment program for Americans and Oklahomans with disabilities.\n\nThe Oklahoma Department of Rehabilitation Services leads this federal-state\npartnership, which earns $4 federal dollars for every state $1 invested.\n\nApproximately, 16.6 percent or more than 643,400 Oklahomans have disabilities,\naccording to the U.S. Census' 2017 American Community Survey.\n\nIn 2019, professional staff at DRS' Vocational Rehabilitation and Services for\nthe Blind and Visually Impaired offered career guidance, counseling, job\nplacement and a range of related services for 15,225 jobseekers with physical\nor mental barriers to employment.\n\nOklahomans receive vocational rehabilitation services from 327 VR and SBVI\ncounselors, rehabilitation technicians and other professional staff located in\nfield offices across the state.\n\n\"In spite of temporary waiting lists due to budget shortfalls, DRS empowered\n1,115 job seekers with disabilities to start their first jobs or return to the\nworkforce as taxpayers who no longer rely on government assistance,\" DRS\nExecutive Director Melinda Fruendt said.\n\n\"As a result, successful clients earned average annual wages of $23,409 and\npaid $3,511 in average taxes,\" Fruendt said.\n\nDRS also works closely with employers through the agency's Business Services\nProgram to recruit qualified employees with disabilities and advises on\nrequest about workplace accessibility, adaptive equipment and business tax\ncredits.\n\nPrior to the Vocational Rehabilitation program, Congress created the Soldier's\nRehabilitation Act to help veterans who sustained disabilities in World War I.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson signed the federal Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation\nAct on June 2, 1920, which is celebrated as the VR #100th anniversary date.\nThe Act extended similar services to non-military citizens, including those\naffected by farm injuries and workplace accidents in the growing manufacturing\neconomy.\n\nThe Oklahoma Legislature approved companion legislation at the state level on\nMarch 28, 1925. The program was funded with state appropriations in 1927.\n\n\"Our Vocational Rehabilitation and Services for the Blind and Visually\nImpaired staff empower thousands of Oklahomans with disabilities every year to\nbecome independent through employment,\" Commission Chair Jace Wolfe said.\n\"They guide and counsel clients, network with employers and remain fully\ncommitted to overcoming barriers that prevent capable, qualified people from\nworking.\n\n\"Now the Covid-19 pandemic has presented additional barriers for jobseekers\nwith and without disabilities, but I know DRS staff is determined to help our\nclients succeed, he said.\"\n\n\"There are many challenges that individuals with disabilities can experience\nin the employment process, ranging from physical, social, and financial. And\nthey're all intertwined,\" Commissioner Emily Cheng said. \"As both a previous\nclient and someone who has been on both sides of the desk, I know firsthand\nthat DRS has a team of incredibly skilled professionals who understand not\nonly the hurdles faced by individuals with disabilities, but the unique skills\nand opportunities that can be harnessed from their experiences.\n\n\"And that's really what they are--hurdles, which means they can be overcome\nwith the right balance of support, empowerment, and determination,\"\nCommissioner Cheng added. \"That's where DRS shines; they know exactly how to\nempower their clients.\"",
