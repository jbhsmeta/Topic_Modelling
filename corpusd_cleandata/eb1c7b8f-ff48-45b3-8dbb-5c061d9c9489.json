    "text": "School of Rock Gambrills has moved to remote music lessons and virtual classes\ndue to coronavirus pandemic much like many entertainment businesses around the\ncountry.\n\nMichael Pistorio, the General Manager of School of Rock Gambrills, is a former\noperatic singer who studied at Salisbury University. He spent about 10 years\nperforming along the Northeastern US but received extensive experience and\ntraining at OperaAACC.\n\nPistorio made a career change to Arts Administration in 2017 and joined the\nSchool of Rock in October 2019.\n\nPistorio talked withThe Capital about the School of Rock Gambrills and its\nwork amid the pandemic.\n\nHow was the transition from in-person to online?\n\nOur process to move online felt like less of a transition and more like a\nlight switch! School of Rock did a company-wide launch of School of Rock\nRemote, an extensive virtual music education curriculum to continue our\nmission as a growing, passionate community dedicated to enriching lives\nthrough music education. Within 4 days, the School of Rock Gambrills had moved\nall private Lessons and group programs online with very little interruption to\nour students' learning.\n\nHow is it staying creative during these times?\n\nAll of our Instructors are actively performing musicians and artists, so\ngetting creative is our specialty! Within weeks of launching School of Rock\nRemote, we added tons of additional programming to our School: Rehearsal\nCheck-In's allowed students to continue their amazing work with their bands\nand see friends they've made, Master Classes were quickly added as a way to\nprovide additional music education on topics that are fun and exciting for all\nof our students, and just last month we added Recording to our band sessions\nso students could create keepsakes of their hard work.\n\nOur Summer Camps are also getting a reboot! For June, we'll be offering two\nRemote Summer Camps in collaboration with Schools of Rock here in Maryland, as\nwell as Virginia, and North Carolina! Students will get group rehearsal\nsessions, private instruction on their instruments, have daily themes and\nprizes, and will get to record songs and even make a Music Video! We'll have\nThe Beatles Camp - June 15-19, 2020 9 a.m.-3 p.m. | and Songwriting Camp -\nJune 22-26, 9 a.m.-3 p.m.\n\nHow have the kids been enjoying online lessons?\n\nOur experience being remote has been overwhelmingly positive! Our Instructors\nhave really put their skills to the test to keep our students engaged and\nexcited about learning, and our Show Directors have really thrived with our\nrecording projects. It has been a great way to make sure our students continue\nto progress and learn while also giving them a taste of what it is really like\nto make a record.\n\nYour favorite song of all time? And why?\n\nIt's so hard to pick just one but I think my favorite rock song would have to\nbe No Leaf Clover by Metallica. I have really great memories of being in the\ncar with my dad listening to this song repeatedly. Plus, as a Classical\nmusician myself, I always loved the juxtaposition of this legendary metal band\ncombined with an equally pedestalled Classical orchestra.\n\nAny plans on opening up anytime soon?\n\nIt's funny you should ask about reopening because we are excited to be in the\nplanning stages now. Like everyone, the safety of our students and our\ninstructors is our primary concern. We are following all CDC guidelines and\nGov. Hogan's Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery while adhering to policies\nfrom our county executives. But, assuming everything continues to trend\ndownward, we hope to welcome our students back in early July. It will be in a\nlimited capacity, only private lessons to start, but just the idea of seeing\nour students again is inspiring us all!\n\nFirst thing you want to do when things are fully open?\n\nI think it's important to mention that our students started this season back\nin February, so they've been working their tails off with their bandmates for\nseveral months now. My first goal when things are fully open is to get each of\nthem on a stage for their friends and family. What's amazing about The School\nof Rock Method is that it actually works. We really do make rock stars out of\nthese kids! It is very important to me that they all have the opportunity to\nput on a great show.\n\nWhat have you enjoyed most about working from home?\n\nIt's been an adjustment for sure, but I think what I've loved most about\nworking from home has been creating deeper bonds with my fellow Maryland\ngeneral managers at School of Rock's Annapolis, Baltimore, & Columbia. I think\npeople expect us to be more competitive with each other since our schools are\nrelatively close in proximity; but Chelsea (Annapolis), Erin (Baltimore), Cody\n(Columbia), and I are actually really good friends! It's been great to have an\nidea for the School and then collaborate with my colleagues on how to make it\na success. The four of us are also excited to be working Schools of Rock in\nShort Pump VA, Midlothian VA, and Charlotte NC on upcoming Master Classes and\nSummer Camps.\n\nWhy is music important during this pandemic?\n\nFor the entirety that humans have walked this planet, artists have continued\nto create, to inspire, and to document their experiences. All we have done is\ncontinue a tradition that goes back several millennia. Music will always be a\nnecessity to the human spirit and we work to instill this passion in each of\nour students. To see the joy and excitement in our students, especially during\nthis public health crisis, has been one of the most rewarding experiences of\nmy life.\n\nCaption: Students of School of Rock have moved to remote learning.\n\nCourtesy Photo",

    "title": "Coronavirus can't stop the beat School of Rock Gambrills has adjusted to remote learning as it hopes to open up soon in July",
    "html": "<p><org>School of Rock Gambrills</org> has moved to remote music lessons and virtual classes due to coronavirus pandemic much like many entertainment businesses around the country.</p>\n<p><person>Michael Pistorio</person>, the General Manager of <org>School of Rock Gambrills</org>, is a former operatic singer who studied at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2830598339\">Salisbury University</org>. He spent about 10 years performing along the Northeastern US but received extensive experience and training at OperaAACC.</p>\n<p>Pistorio made a career change to <org>Arts Administration</org> in 2017 and joined the <org>School of Rock</org> in <chron>October 2019</chron>.</p>\n<p>Pistorio talked withThe Capital about the <org>School of Rock Gambrills</org> and its work amid the pandemic.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How was the transition from in-person to online?</p>\n<p>Our process to move online felt like less of a transition and more like a light switch! <org>School of Rock</org> did a company-wide launch of <org>School of Rock Remote</org>, an extensive virtual music education curriculum to continue our mission as a growing, passionate community dedicated to enriching lives through music education. Within 4 days, the <org>School of Rock Gambrills</org> had moved all private Lessons and group programs online with very little interruption to our students' learning.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How is it staying creative during these times? </p>\n<p>All of our Instructors are actively performing musicians and artists, so getting creative is our specialty! Within weeks of launching <org>School of Rock Remote</org>, we added tons of additional programming to our School: Rehearsal Check-In's allowed students to continue their amazing work with their bands and see friends they've made, Master Classes were quickly added as a way to provide additional music education on topics that are fun and exciting for all of our students, and just last month we added Recording to our band sessions so students could create keepsakes of their hard work.</p>\n<p>Our Summer Camps are also getting a reboot! For June, we'll be offering two Remote Summer Camps in collaboration with Schools of Rock here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location>, as well as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location>! Students will get group rehearsal sessions, private instruction on their instruments, have daily themes and prizes, and will get to record songs and even make a Music Video! We'll have The Beatles Camp - <chron>June 15-19, 2020</chron> <chron>9 a.m.-3 p.m.</chron> | and Songwriting Camp - <chron>June 22-26</chron>, <chron>9 a.m.-3 p.m.</chron></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How have the kids been enjoying online lessons? </p>\n<p>Our experience being remote has been overwhelmingly positive! Our Instructors have really put their skills to the test to keep our students engaged and excited about learning, and our Show Directors have really thrived with our recording projects. It has been a great way to make sure our students continue to progress and learn while also giving them a taste of what it is really like to make a record.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Your favorite song of all time? And why?</p>\n<p>It's so hard to pick just one but I think my favorite rock song would have to be No <person>Leaf Clover</person> by Metallica. I have really great memories of being in the car with my dad listening to this song repeatedly. Plus, as a Classical musician myself, I always loved the juxtaposition of this legendary metal band combined with an equally pedestalled Classical orchestra.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Any plans on opening up anytime soon? </p>\n<p>It's funny you should ask about reopening because we are excited to be in the planning stages now. Like everyone, the safety of our students and our instructors is our primary concern. We are following all <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">CDC</org> guidelines and <person>Gov. Hogan's</person> <person>Maryland Strong</person>: Roadmap to Recovery while adhering to policies from our county executives. But, assuming everything continues to trend downward, we hope to welcome our students back in early July. It will be in a limited capacity, only private lessons to start, but just the idea of seeing our students again is inspiring us all!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First thing you want to do when things are fully open?</p>\n<p>I think it's important to mention that our students started this season back in February, so they've been working their tails off with their bandmates for several months now. My first goal when things are fully open is to get each of them on a stage for their friends and family. What's amazing about <org>The School of Rock Method</org> is that it actually works. We really do make rock stars out of these kids! It is very important to me that they all have the opportunity to put on a great show.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What have you enjoyed most about working from home?</p>\n<p>It's been an adjustment for sure, but I think what I've loved most about working from home has been creating deeper bonds with my fellow Maryland general managers at <org>School of Rock's</org> <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.annpls\">Annapolis</location>, Baltimore, &amp; Columbia. I think people expect us to be more competitive with each other since our schools are relatively close in proximity; but Chelsea (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.annpls\">Annapolis</location>), <person>Erin (Baltimore)</person>, <person>Cody (Columbia)</person>, and I are actually really good friends! It's been great to have an idea for the School and then collaborate with my colleagues on how to make it a success. The four of us are also excited to be working Schools of Rock in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.shoump\">Short Pump VA</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.midian\">Midlothian VA</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.charlt\">Charlotte NC</location> on upcoming Master Classes and Summer Camps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Why is music important during this pandemic? </p>\n<p>For the entirety that humans have walked this planet, artists have continued to create, to inspire, and to document their experiences. All we have done is continue a tradition that goes back several millennia. Music will always be a necessity to the human spirit and we work to instill this passion in each of our students. To see the joy and excitement in our students, especially during this public health crisis, has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.</p>\n<p>Caption: Students of <org>School of Rock</org> have moved to remote learning.</p>\n<p>Courtesy Photo</p>",
