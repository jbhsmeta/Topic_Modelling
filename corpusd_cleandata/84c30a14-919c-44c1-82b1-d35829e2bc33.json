    "text": "VENICE \\- Video taken at Wellfield Park off Pinebrook Road shows what appears\nto be a funnel cloud and tornado that damaged the dugout and other buildings.\n\nLate Monday, the National Weather Service agreed.\n\nEarly thoughts focused on the possibility of a microburst at a nearby Publix\n\\- but the park is close to the Venice Commons supermarket.\n\n\"We started getting some video in that it was clearly a tornado,\" NWS\nmeteorologist Dan Sobien said. \"It was those videos - and it was very clear it\nwas a tornado.\"\n\nOne of the videos, from Venice resident Lindsey Hutchison, was taken while she\nwas in a car with her family when they witnessed what they believe was a\ntornado.\n\nNolan Hutchison, 10, told his parents about something odd in the sky.\n\n\"My son saw what he thought was a fire coming over the treetops,\" Lindsey\nHutchison said. \"It dropped right in front of us coming across the ball\nfield.\"\n\nThe two-minute video shows the apparent funnel drop down close to the ground\nand then scrap back up. Lindsey and Jason Hutchison are heard talking about\nneeding to call the National Weather Service, athletic coaches and, finally,\nher mother.\n\n\"I'm shaking so bad,\" she says during the video.\n\nMoments later, several cars and trees were damaged by a windstorm at the\nVenice Publix at Venice Commons.\n\nNo injuries were reported Monday night.\n\nLindsey Hutchison said her family noticed a strange shift in the weather prior\nto the tornado. But there was no \"loud noise\" that often is said to accompany\na tornado.\n\n\"My husband literally said 'It looks like a wall of rain coming toward us,'\"\nshe said.\n\nJason Hutchison said everything seemed \"pretty calm\" prior to it. But it was\nodd.\n\n\"When the storm was coming in, I told my friends it looked pretty crazy. The\nsky was real green in some spots. There was a lot of turbulence in the air up\nthere,\" Jason Hutchison said.\n\nWhen he saw it, he said he knew what it was.\n\n\"This was definitely a tornado,\" Jason Hutchison said. \"We all couldn't\nbelieve how quick it happened.\"\n\nHe said it went south by southwest - toward Venice Publix.\n\nLindsey Hutchison said instinct took over.\n\n\"I threw the car in reverse very quickly,\" she said.\n\nAlong with dugouts, the soccer fields and football field were damaged.\n\nThere wasn't a loud noise, she said.\n\nAs of late Monday, a full report on the weather event hadn't been released.\n\nEmail: [scott.lawson@yoursun.com](mailto:scott.lawson@yoursun.com).",

But there was no \"loud noise\" that often is said to accompany a tornado.</p>\n\n<p>\"My husband literally said 'It looks like a wall of rain coming toward us,'\" she said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Jason Hutchison</person> said everything seemed \"pretty calm\" prior to it. But it was odd.</p>\n\n<p>\"When the storm was coming in, I told my friends it looked pretty crazy. The sky was real green in some spots. There was a lot of turbulence in the air up there,\" <person>Jason Hutchison</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>When he saw it, he said he knew what it was.</p>\n\n<p>\"This was definitely a tornado,\" <person>Jason Hutchison</person> said. \"We all couldn't believe how quick it happened.\"</p>\n\n<p>He said it went south by southwest - toward Venice Publix.</p>\n\n<p><person>Lindsey Hutchison</person> said instinct took over.</p>\n\n<p>\"I threw the car in reverse very quickly,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Along with dugouts, the soccer fields and football field were damaged.</p>\n\n<p>There wasn't a loud noise, she said.</p>\n\n<p>As of late Monday, a full report on the weather event hadn't been released.</p>\n\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:scott.lawson@yoursun.com\">scott.lawson@yoursun.com</a>.</p>",
