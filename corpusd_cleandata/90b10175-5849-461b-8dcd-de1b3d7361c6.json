    "text": "Raleigh: Goston County of North Carolina has issued the following news\nrelease:\n\nAfter weeks of intense scrutiny and revisions, Gaston County manager Dr. Kim\nEagle presented her recommended budget to the Board of Commissioners Tuesday\nnight, asking for a flat property tax rate.\n\nThe recommended budget is a 2 percent decrease ($4.4M) from spending levels in\nthe current fiscal year, given projections about expected declines in sales\nand property taxes over the next 12 months.\n\nDr. Eagle recommended a slight mid-year salary increase for existing staff as\npart of a transition to a merit-based pay plan, which was recommended by the\nBoard of Commissioners. The cost of the merit plan is more than covered by\nsavings from a vacancy rate plan plus a hiring freeze for all positions not\nconsidered critical to the continued delivery of county services.\n\nThe County is also not adding any new 100 percent County-funded positions in\nthe FY21 budget year. The hiring freeze will run through the end of the\ncalendar year, at which point county leaders will reevaluate the need based on\nthe economic climate and updated revenue projections.\n\n\"This is truly about doing more with less,\" Dr. Eagle said. \"We have asked a\nlot of our staff during this crisis and we will continue to ask a lot of them.\nThis budget puts County government on firm footing to continue to meet the\nneeds of our residents while keeping those most affected economically by\nCOVID-19 from falling through the cracks.\"\n\nRight now, the County is anticipating a 12.5 percent dip in sales tax revenue\n- a middle of the road projection from the various forecasts that have been\ndone. The county is also projecting a smaller drop in property tax, primarily\ndue to a drop in the motor vehicle tax base.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners is set to meet for a budget retreat on June 4th to\ndiscuss the budget and then is set to adopt a final budget at its June 9th\nregular meeting.\n\nTo view the full budget:\n\nFY21 Manager's Recommended Budget\n\nFY21 Manager's Recommended Budget Presentation\n\nFY21 Budget in Brief\n\nDollar Chart\n\nSelected County Stats",

The cost of the merit\nplan is more than covered by savings from a vacancy rate plan plus a\nhiring freeze for all positions not considered critical to the continued\ndelivery of county services.</p>\n\n<p>The County is also not adding any new 100 percent County-funded\npositions in the FY21 budget year. The hiring freeze will run through\nthe end of the calendar year, at which point county leaders will\nreevaluate the need based on the economic climate and updated revenue\nprojections.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is truly about doing more with less,\" <person>Dr. Eagle</person>\nsaid. \"We have asked a lot of our staff during this crisis and we\nwill continue to ask a lot of them. This budget puts County government\non firm footing to continue to meet the needs of our residents while\nkeeping those most affected economically by COVID-19 from falling\nthrough the cracks.\"</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the County is anticipating a 12.5 percent dip in sales\ntax revenue - a middle of the road projection from the various forecasts\nthat have been done. The county is also projecting a smaller drop in\nproperty tax, primarily due to a drop in the motor vehicle tax base.</p>\n\n<p>The <org>Board of Commissioners</org> is set to meet for a budget retreat on\n<chron>June 4th</chron> to discuss the budget and then is set to adopt a final budget\nat its <chron>June 9th</chron> regular meeting.</p>\n\n<p>To view the full budget:</p>\n\n<p>FY21 Manager's Recommended Budget</p>\n\n<p>FY21 Manager's Recommended Budget Presentation</p>\n\n<p>FY21 Budget in Brief</p>\n\n<p>Dollar Chart</p>\n\n<p>Selected County Stats</p>",
