This program is for all ages. This program combines voluntary laughter exercises with gentle breathing techniques to teach the body how to laugh without relying on jokes or humor. This is a participatory program where we will create moments to laugh in through guided actions. No need to bring a yoga mat - most of the program is seated, with options for standing or gentle movement. What are the benefits of laughter? Mood elevates. Stress, depression and tension decrease. Immunity improves. Lung capacity increases through deep breathing, enhancing oxygen delivery to all parts of the body. Endorphin and serotonin levels rise. Laughter provides an excellent internal massage to digestive tract as well as improving blood supply to the internal organs. People who laugh don't worry as much as people who don't laugh.</p>\n\n<p>Tips On How To Get Published -- A Panel Discussion ON ZOOM (RR): <chron>7 p.m.</chron> <chron>June 10</chron>.
