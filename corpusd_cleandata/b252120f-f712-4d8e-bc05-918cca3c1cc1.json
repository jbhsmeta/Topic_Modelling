    "text": "Video on demand is having a moment - and with movie theaters closed\nindefinitely, it's likely to gain even more popularity. Back at the beginning\nof the pandemic, studios dropped a batch of flicks on streaming platforms, and\nwe gobbled them up. Fast forward a dozen weeks and there's an avalanche of\nchoices. This week's foursome runs the gamut: horror, documentary, comedy and\nuplifting drama. Skip or stream? Read on and find out.\n\n\"Military Wives\": You could do worse than this uplifting, but saccharinely\nstory about British army wives forming a choir while awaiting the return of\ntheir spouses from deployment. The film is based on real events that occurred\nat Flitcroft Garrison and is directed by \"The Full Monty's\" Peter Cattaneo.\nThe cast is headed by ever-dependable Kristin Scott Thomas as the buttoned-up,\nefficient Kate, wife of the colonel. Sharon Horgan is the more laidback, wine-\nswilling Lisa, who becomes a reluctant leader after her husband is promoted.\nSparring ensues as the two women have different approaches to running the\nchoir. Just like a sports movie, the by-the-numbers plot moves along smoothly,\nhitting all the expected beats and culminating with the big game - a\nnationally televised event at London's Royal Albert Hall. A sisterhood forms,\nconflicts wrap up tidily and the message of \"stronger together\" is certainly\non point. The effort is so earnest that it's hard to hate, especially when\naccompanied by songs by Cyndi Lauper and The Spice Girls. (PG-13 for some\nstrong language and sexual references. Available to rent from Plimoth Virtual\nCinema, [www.plimoth.org](http://www.plimoth.org)) Grade: B\n\n\"Spaceship Earth\": There's nothing less inviting than watching people live in\nquarantine while most of us do the same. But that's where documentarian Matt\nWolf takes you in exploring the notorious Biosphere 2 ecological experiment,\nwhere from 1991 to 1993 four men and four women occupied a sprawling three-\nacre $200 million, hermetically sealed structure in the Arizona desert. The\ngoal was to see if life could thrive in a controlled, cloistered system. Like\nMatt Damon in \"The Martian,\" the \"biospherians\" grew their own food, recycled\ntheir air, water and waste, independent and untouched by the world outside. Or\nwas it? Therein lies the problem. Accusations of fraud abound, which makes for\nriveting viewing but bad science. The documentary plays out like a season of\n\"Big Brother,\" with interpersonal conflicts, cults, deception, sabotage and\neven Steve Bannon, the ex-Trump adviser running the experiment. (Not rated;\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and Hulu) Grade: B+\n\n\"The Wretched\": The low-budget indie horror flick from siblings Drew and Brett\nPierce has been the No. 1 rental since it was released May 1. The story\ncenters on Ben (John-Paul Howard), a rebellious teenager discovering - \"Rear\nWindow\"-style - there's a witch (Zarah Mahler) living next door. And she's\nthirsty. The setting is an idyllic tourist town where Ben goes to spend the\nsummer working at his father's (Jamison Jones) marina. He befriends Mallory\n(Piper Curda), his Girl Friday. Ben's suspicions are ignored. So he makes it\nhis mission to put an end to the witch's reign of terror. The plot moves along\nswiftly, relying on rote genre tropes (dark basements, creepy woodsy setting,\nchildren in peril) before descending into supernatural shenanigans. Some\neffective scares are enhanced by creative sound mixing evoking enough dread to\nkeep you engaged. (Not rated; Available to rent via video on demand) Grade: B-\n\n\"Lucky Grandma\": I saved the best for last. Director Sasie Sealy's feature\nfilm debut is one, fun flick. Eighty-six-year-old Tsai Chin (\"Joy Luck Club\")\nsteals the show as a recently widowed, chain-smoking, gambling granny running\ninto a load of cash that pits her against the local mob boss in New York's\nChinatown. After she's chased and shaken down by goons named Pock-Mark (Woody\nFu) and Little Handsome (Michael Tow), Grandma hires a sizable bodyguard\ncalled Big Pong (Hsiao-Yuan Ha). He turns out to be a Teddy bear, naturally,\nand he and Grandma develop a bond. They've got an engaging dynamic, but it's\nChin who carries a film that at times is tonally jarring, as the plot veers\noff into an abduction situation. Yet, you follow along. Chin's presence\nconveys gravitas, and she does it all with piercing eyes and scathing\nexpressions. She's one tough cookie. (Unrated and available to stream from the\nThe Brattle's Virtual Screening Room,\n[www.brattlefilm.org](http://www.brattlefilm.org)) Grade: B+\n\nDana Barbuto may be reached at\n[dbarbuto@patriotledger.com](mailto:dbarbuto@patriotledger.com) or follow her\non Twitter @dbarbuto_Ledger.",

    "html": "<p>Video on demand is having a moment - and with movie theaters closed indefinitely, it's likely to gain even more popularity. Back at the beginning of the pandemic, studios dropped a batch of flicks on streaming platforms, and we gobbled them up. Fast forward a dozen weeks and there's an avalanche of choices. This week's foursome runs the gamut: horror, documentary, comedy and uplifting drama. Skip or stream? Read on and find out.</p>\n<p>\"Military Wives\": You could do worse than this uplifting, but saccharinely story about British army wives forming a choir while awaiting the return of their spouses from deployment. The film is based on real events that occurred at Flitcroft Garrison and is directed by \"The Full Monty's\" <person>Peter Cattaneo</person>. The cast is headed by ever-dependable <person>Kristin Scott Thomas</person> as the buttoned-up, efficient Kate, wife of the colonel. <person>Sharon Horgan</person> is the more laidback, wine-swilling Lisa, who becomes a reluctant leader after her husband is promoted. Sparring ensues as the two women have different approaches to running the choir. Just like a sports movie, the by-the-numbers plot moves along smoothly, hitting all the expected beats and culminating with the big game - a nationally televised event at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London's</location> Royal Albert Hall. A sisterhood forms, conflicts wrap up tidily and the message of \"stronger together\" is certainly on point. The effort is so earnest that it's hard to hate, especially when accompanied by songs by <person>Cyndi Lauper</person> and The Spice Girls. (PG-13 for some strong language and sexual references. Available to rent from Plimoth Virtual Cinema, <a href=\"http://www.plimoth.org\">www.plimoth.org</a>) Grade: B</p>\n\n<p>\"Spaceship Earth\": There's nothing less inviting than watching people live in quarantine while most of us do the same. But that's where documentarian <person>Matt Wolf</person> takes you in exploring the notorious Biosphere 2 ecological experiment, where from 1991 to 1993 four men and four women occupied a sprawling three-acre <money>$200 million</money>, hermetically sealed structure in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.az\">Arizona</location> desert. The goal was to see if life could thrive in a controlled, cloistered system. Like <person>Matt Damon</person> in \"The Martian,\" the \"biospherians\" grew their own food, recycled their air, water and waste, independent and untouched by the world outside. Or was it? Therein lies the problem. Accusations of fraud abound, which makes for riveting viewing but bad science. The documentary plays out like a season of \"Big Brother,\" with interpersonal conflicts, cults, deception, sabotage and even <person>Steve Bannon</person>, the ex-Trump adviser running the experiment. (Not rated; Available to rent on <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:AMZN\">Amazon</org> and Hulu) Grade: B+</p>\n\n<p>\"The Wretched\": The low-budget indie horror flick from siblings Drew and <person>Brett Pierce</person> has been the No. 1 rental since it was released <chron>May 1</chron>. The story centers on Ben (<person>John-Paul Howard</person>), a rebellious teenager discovering - \"Rear Window\"-style - there's a witch (<person>Zarah Mahler</person>) living next door. And she's thirsty. The setting is an idyllic tourist town where Ben goes to spend the summer working at his father's (<person>Jamison Jones</person>) marina. He befriends Mallory (<person>Piper Curda</person>), his Girl Friday. Ben's suspicions are ignored. So he makes it his mission to put an end to the witch's reign of terror. The plot moves along swiftly, relying on rote genre tropes (dark basements, creepy woodsy setting, children in peril) before descending into supernatural shenanigans. Some effective scares are enhanced by creative sound mixing evoking enough dread to keep you engaged. (Not rated; Available to rent via video on demand) Grade: B-</p>\n\n<p>\"Lucky Grandma\": I saved the best for last. Director <person>Sasie Sealy's</person> feature film debut is one, fun flick. Eighty-six-year-old <person>Tsai Chin</person> (\"<org>Joy Luck Club</org>\") steals the show as a recently widowed, chain-smoking, gambling granny running into a load of cash that pits her against the local mob boss in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York's</location> <location>Chinatown</location>. After she's chased and shaken down by goons named Pock-Mark (<person>Woody Fu</person>) and Little Handsome (<person>Michael Tow</person>), Grandma hires a sizable bodyguard called Big Pong (<person>Hsiao-Yuan Ha</person>). He turns out to be a Teddy bear, naturally, and he and Grandma develop a bond. They've got an engaging dynamic, but it's Chin who carries a film that at times is tonally jarring, as the plot veers off into an abduction situation. Yet, you follow along. Chin's presence conveys gravitas, and she does it all with piercing eyes and scathing expressions. She's one tough cookie. (Unrated and available to stream from the <location>The Brattle's Virtual Screening Room</location>, <a href=\"http://www.brattlefilm.org\">www.brattlefilm.org</a>) Grade: B+</p>\n\n<p><person>Dana Barbuto</person> may be reached at <a href=\"mailto:dbarbuto@patriotledger.com\">dbarbuto@patriotledger.com</a> or follow her on Twitter @dbarbuto_Ledger.</p>",
