    "text": "A former Lower Southampton official has filed a whistleblower's suit against\nthe township, alleging he was pushed out after exposing more than $75,000 in\nunexplained financial losses and other discrepancies under the former zoning\ndepartment director.\n\nAmong his allegations, William Oettinger, of Lower Southampton, contends\ntownship supervisors wrongly blamed him for an expired performance bond and\nordered him to stop talking to this news organization, according to the suit\nfiled in Bucks County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nLower Southampton Supervisors Chairman Ray Weldie on Monday said he was aware\nof the lawsuit, but had not seen it since it was filed in late April.\n\nOettinger, who worked for Lower Southampton since 2007, was appointed fire\nmarshal in 2010 and zoning officer in July 2018, after serving as interim\ndepartment head for four months. He was removed as zoning officer last year\nand not re-appointed as fire marshal in January.\n\nAccording to the suit, Oettinger contends he was singled out as a target for\nretaliation after the release of a 2018 outside audit of the township's zoning\ndepartment. The audit found significant problems in the department's\npractices.\n\nIn his suit, Oettinger maintained he -- not township supervisors -- insisted\non the two-year audit of the department's operations as a condition for\naccepting the zoning officer job because of concerns he had with how the\noffice was run under his predecessor, Carol Drioli.\n\nThe audit led to state and county investigations into the office's past\npractices. At least one investigation by the state Department of Labor and\nIndustry is ongoing.\n\nNo criminal charges have been filed.\n\nIn his suit, Oettinger alleges he implemented many of the report's\nrecommendations to bring the department into compliance with state and local\nregulations. They included creating a new checks-and-balances system,\nrequiring applicants to sign professional service agreements, and notifying\ndevelopers when escrow balances fall below township minimum thresholds.\n\nBut it was his cooperation with local media and at least one supervisor\nlooking into the zoning department that led to problems, Oettinger alleges.\n\nOettinger claims in the suit that he was pressured by former Township Manager\nJohn McMenamin and current Township Manager and Financial Director Joe Galdo\nnot to answer questions from the media, specifically this news organization,\nabout past zoning department operations.\n\nHe alleges after he provided Supervisor Kim Koutsouratis with documents\nrelated to the audit report findings under a Right to Know request he filed,\nMcMenamin was \"not pleased.\"\n\nMcMenamin allegedly told Oettinger, who was the township's Open Records\nOfficer, that he \"did not need to tell (Koutsouratis) the truth as to what he\nwas asking for,\" according to the suit.\n\nIn April 2019, Galdo, then acting township manager, told Oettinger to stop\nhaving \"independent\" discussions with the press or risk losing his job,\naccording to the suit.\n\nThree months later, Galdo allegedly ordered all Right to Know requests from\nthis news organization forwarded to his office.\n\nOettinger alleges in December 2018 he completed an internal report, which\nshowed the township failed to collect more than more than $75,000 in\napplication fees for 56 projects between 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe so-called \"Oettinger Report\" also exposed instances in which the\ndepartment \"drastically deviated,\" without explanation, authority or proper\nwaivers, from the township's fee schedule, which sets fees for various\nservices including zoning and land development, according to the suit.\n\nTwo weeks after this news organization published the report's findings, Galdo\naccused Oettinger during an executive session the supervisors of allowing a\nperformance bond to expire for a major commercial development, according to\nthe suit.\n\nTownship Solicitor Frank Dillon, though, stated that Oettinger was not\nresponsible since he wasn't told about the bond and he didn't have access to\nthe document, which was kept locked in Galdo's finance director's office,\naccording to the suit.\n\nFollowing the executive session, the board voted to separate the positions of\nzoning officer and fire marshal.\n\nThe township hired Jeff Bartlett as zoning officer, who took over in October\nand has since announced his own resignation from the post.\n\nOettinger remained as fire marshal and Open Records Officer until the annual\ntownship reorganization meeting on Jan. 6, when he alleges he was blindsided\nin a 3-2 vote against reappointing him, according to the suit.\n\nSupervisors Weldie, Deborah Kaplan and Ed Shannon voted no, but did not\nprovide a reason; supervisors Koutsouratis and Cummings voted in Oettinger's\nfavor.\n\nIn the suit, Oettinger alleges that the reappointment vote was the first one\nthe board had done since he was appointed 10 years earlier, though the\ntownship code requires the supervisors appoint a fire marshal annually.\n\nDuring the meeting, Koutsouratis, a frequent defender of Oettinger, stated the\nthree supervisors had decided before the meeting not to reappoint Oettinger,\nand that the information was not shared with him or Cummings.\n\nThe suit states that Galdo did not want Oettinger reappointed because he \"did\nnot like the supposed public perception\" involving Oettinger's purchase of a\nhome in Lower Southampton from a local businessman.\n\nIn August 2019, Oettinger purchased a home owned by Gerald Clabbers, who owns\nmultiple properties in the township, a transaction the suit described as\n\"being at arm's length and fair market value.\"\n\nThe suit alleges that Oettinger cleared any potential conflict of interest\nissues with Dillon before the purchase. The property had been subject to a\nsubdivision application approved in 2009.\n\nThe supervisors approved a lot line change for the property in June 2019,\nmoving a property line that runs through the middle of an existing in-ground\npool and creating a larger lot with the home and reducing the size of a vacant\nlot along Brownsville road, according to board minutes.",

    "title": "Former Lower Southampton official files whistleblower lawsuit",
    "html": "<p>A former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lopton\">Lower Southampton</location> official has filed a whistleblower's suit against the township, alleging he was pushed out after exposing more than <money>$75,000</money> in unexplained financial losses and other discrepancies under the former zoning department director.</p>\n<p>Among his allegations, <person>William Oettinger</person>, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lopton\">Lower Southampton</location>, contends township supervisors wrongly blamed him for an expired performance bond and ordered him to stop talking to this news organization, according to the suit filed in <org>Bucks County Court of Common Pleas</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Lower Southampton Supervisors Chairman <person>Ray Weldie</person> on Monday said he was aware of the lawsuit, but had not seen it since it was filed in late April.</p>\n\n<p>Oettinger, who worked for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lopton\">Lower Southampton</location> since 2007, was appointed fire marshal in 2010 and zoning officer in <chron>July 2018</chron>, after serving as interim department head for four months. He was removed as zoning officer last year and not re-appointed as fire marshal in January.</p>\n\n<p>According to the suit, Oettinger contends he was singled out as a target for retaliation after the release of a 2018 outside audit of the township's zoning department. The audit found significant problems in the department's practices.</p>\n\n<p>In his suit, Oettinger maintained he &#8212; not township supervisors &#8212; insisted on the two-year audit of the department's operations as a condition for accepting the zoning officer job because of concerns  he had with how the office was run under his predecessor, <person>Carol Drioli</person>.</p>\n\n<p>The audit led to state and county investigations into the office's past practices. At least one investigation by the state <org>Department of Labor and Industry</org> is ongoing.</p>\n\n<p>No criminal charges have been filed.</p>\n\n<p>In his suit, Oettinger alleges he implemented many of the report's recommendations to bring the department into compliance with state and local regulations. They included creating a new checks-and-balances system, requiring applicants to sign professional service agreements, and notifying developers when escrow balances fall below township minimum thresholds.</p>\n\n<p>But it was his cooperation with local media and at least one supervisor looking into the zoning department that led to problems, Oettinger alleges.</p>\n\n<p>Oettinger claims in the suit that he was pressured by former Township Manager <person>John McMenamin</person> and current Township Manager and Financial Director <person>Joe Galdo</person> not to answer questions from the media, specifically this news organization, about past zoning department operations.</p>\n\n<p>He alleges after he provided Supervisor <person>Kim Koutsouratis</person> with documents related to the audit report findings under a Right to Know request he filed, McMenamin was \"not pleased.\"</p>\n\n<p>McMenamin allegedly told Oettinger, who was the township's Open Records Officer, that he \"did not need to tell (Koutsouratis) the truth as to what he was asking for,\" according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>In <chron>April 2019</chron>, Galdo, then acting township manager, told Oettinger to stop having \"independent\" discussions with the press or risk losing his job, according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>Three months later, Galdo allegedly ordered all Right to Know requests from this news organization forwarded to his office.</p>\n\n<p>Oettinger alleges in <chron>December 2018</chron> he completed an internal report,  which showed the township failed to collect more than more than <money>$75,000</money> in application fees for 56 projects between 2012 and 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The so-called \"Oettinger Report\" also exposed instances in which the department \"drastically deviated,\" without explanation, authority or proper waivers, from the township's fee schedule, which sets fees for various services including zoning and land development, according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks after this news organization published the report's findings, Galdo accused Oettinger during an executive session the supervisors of allowing a performance bond to expire for a major commercial development, according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>Township Solicitor <person>Frank Dillon</person>, though, stated that Oettinger was not responsible since he wasn't told about the bond and he didn't have access to the document, which was kept locked in Galdo's finance director's office, according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>Following the executive session, the board voted to separate the positions of zoning officer and fire marshal.</p>\n\n<p>The township hired <person>Jeff Bartlett</person> as zoning officer, who took over in October and has since announced his own resignation from the post.</p>\n\n<p>Oettinger remained as fire marshal and Open Records Officer until the annual township reorganization meeting on <chron>Jan. 6</chron>, when he alleges he was blindsided in a 3-2 vote against reappointing him, according to the suit.</p>\n\n<p>Supervisors Weldie, <person>Deborah Kaplan</person> and <person>Ed Shannon</person> voted no, but did not provide a reason; supervisors Koutsouratis and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.cumngs\">Cummings</location> voted in Oettinger's favor.</p>\n\n<p>In the suit, Oettinger alleges that the reappointment vote was the first one the board had done since he was appointed 10 years earlier, though the township code requires the supervisors appoint a fire marshal annually.</p>\n\n<p>During the meeting, Koutsouratis, a frequent defender of Oettinger, stated the three supervisors had decided before the meeting not to reappoint Oettinger, and that the information was not shared with him or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.cumngs\">Cummings</location>.</p>\n\n<p>The suit states that Galdo did not want Oettinger reappointed because he \"did not like the supposed public perception\" involving Oettinger's purchase of a home in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lopton\">Lower Southampton</location> from a local businessman.</p>\n\n<p>In <chron>August 2019</chron>, Oettinger purchased a home owned by Gerald Clabbers, who owns multiple properties in the township, a transaction the suit described as \"being at arm's length and fair market value.\"</p>\n\n<p>The suit alleges that Oettinger cleared any potential conflict of interest issues with Dillon before the purchase. The property had been subject to a subdivision application approved in 2009.</p>\n\n<p>The supervisors approved a lot line change for the property in <chron>June 2019</chron>, moving a property line that runs through the middle of an existing in-ground pool and creating a larger lot with the home and reducing the size of a vacant lot along Brownsville road, according to board minutes.</p>",
