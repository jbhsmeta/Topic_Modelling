We\nare inspired by so many young people speaking out against injustice.\"\n\nShowdown: Law-and-order president versus protesters\n\nThe Somerset Collection at Big Beaver Road and Coolidge Highway was closed all\nday Monday.\n\n\"Given recent events at shopping destinations across the country, coupled with\nthe company-wide closures of many of our retailers, Somerset Collection is\ntaking the necessary safety precautions for everyone involved, which includes\nclosing our center today,\" said Peter Van Dyke, Somerset spokesman, in a\nstatement.\n\n\"Somerset Collection values and supports freedom of speech and peaceful\nprotest.\"\n\nPhotos from protest in Troy\n\nTroy Mayor Ethan Baker said before the protest that the Troy Police Department\nwas well prepared and coordinated efforts with Oakland County authorities, the\nMichigan State Police and Somerset Collection management.\n\nThe protest, in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis after a\npolice officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck, was organized by Black\nLives Matter and By Any Means Necessary, according to fliers announcing the\nevent.\n\nIt started at 5 p.m. at Athens High School; participants marched along Big\nBeaver to the police station.\n\nSomerset had just reopened Friday after being shuttered for months because of\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTroy police posted on social media at about 6 p.m. that motorists should\nexpect intermittent closures for the next hour on Big Beaver from Coolidge to\nLivernois to allow protesters to walk safely in the road.\n\n\"The Troy PD supports the right to peaceful protest and decries injustice. We\nare here for you and with you,\" the police department said on social media.\n\nProtests around the country since Floyd's May 25 death have been marked in\nmany cases by arrests, violence and destruction of buildings and property.\n\nLarge crowds gathered in Detroit over the past four nights, with police\nreporting arrests of demonstrators who allegedly hurled items at officers.\n\nAbout 100 people protested peacefully in Royal Oak Monday evening.\n\nA small protest was held without incident outside the police station in\nLivonia Sunday night. Several stores closed in anticipation of possible\nrioting.\n\nRELATED:\n\nStrong words, peaceful behavior mark protest in Royal Oak\n\nTrump slams governors as 'weak,' urges crackdown on protests",
