    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at\nTelecommunications Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from\nAlexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventor Aramli,\nMark Darius (Newport, RI), filed on April 1, 2019, was published online on\nJune 8, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent, patent number 10,660,451, is Bedjet LLC\n(Newport, Rhode Island, United States).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Technical Field of the Invention\n\n\"The invention is a home appliance that provides very rapid heating of a bed\nvia forced heated air prior to the user entering the bed, or while the user is\nin the bed and also provides a cooling effect after the user has entered the\nbed via fresh room temperature air being forced into the bedding. That is, the\ninvention relates to supplying forced air, which may be heated, within a space\nbetween a fitted mattress sheet and a bedding sheet or within a layer of\nbedding. Further, a wireless protocol access device is used to send commands\nremotely to the bedding climate control apparatus that affect operating\nparameters of the apparatus and includes setting the temperature of a space\nbetween a fitted mattress sheet and a bed sheet by delivery of forced air,\nwhich may be heated with heating power as warranted.\n\n\"Description of Related Art\n\n\"Current control of the temperature of a bed relies on electric blankets or\nelectric mattress pads. These devices are limited in their wattage capability\nand typically take 30 to 45 minutes to raise the temperature of bedding by 20\ndegrees F. As well, they provide no means to cool the user. They also provide\nno circulation of fresh air into the bedding.\n\n\"Some products are currently in use in the medical field that provide forced\nair bed heating to patients in surgical recovery rooms. These devices cannot\nbe used without proprietary gowns with airflow channels or perforated sheets\nwith airflow channels that must be connected to the forced air heater for\ndistribution of the heat to the patient. These products are also not used for\ncooling.\n\n\"The Electric Blanket Institute finds that the average electric blanket puts\nout less than 200 watts of heating power, and some portion of this energy is\nemitted to the topside of the blanket into the bedroom.\n\n\"Electric blankets have embedded wires, which one can feel and these wires can\nbe chewed on by pets or damaged by children and sharp objects.\n\n\"Many electric blankets aren't reliable after repeated washings or have very\nspecial washing and drying instructions that must be followed. The present\ninventor has found by observing through an IR camera that wires of a brand new\nblanket purchased from a major department store after 45 minutes on 'Hi'\nsetting do not provide even heating. Older electric blankets cause hundreds of\nfires a year from wires in the bed.\n\n\"It is desired to deliver heat to bedding and sheets or to provide the\nsensation of cooling to a person within the bedding and sheets, all under\ndirection from a bedside remote control. In so doing, it is desired to deliver\nto bedding and sheets more dry heating power than is available from electric\nblankets in a safe and quiet manner at a temperature that is the same as\nprovided by a household HVAC central air-heating unit, and forced ambient\ntemperature air in a controllable fashion\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors\nalso obtained the inventor's summary information for this patent: \"The present\ninvention pertains to a method and means of operation of a bedding climate\ncontrol apparatus.\n\n\"That is, In response to wireless receipt of commands by a bedding climate\ncontrol apparatus of the present invention, the bedding climate control\napparatus varies a temperature or humidity of a space between a bed sheet and\na fitted mattress sheet or within a layer of bedding in accordance with the\ncommands. Preferably, the bedding climate control apparatus is responsive to\nsimultaneous and non-simultaneous receipt of commands from both a protocol\naccess enabled device and a remote control wireless communication device to\nvary, in accordance with the commands, the temperature or humidity within a\nspace between a bed sheet and a fitted mattress sheet or within a layer of\nbedding.\n\n\"The operation of the bedding climate control apparatus may be equipped with\nappropriate means to perform the following steps or functions:\n\n\"receiving commands with a signal receiver of the bedding climate control\napparatus;\n\n\"sensing the temperature or humidity of the space between bedding and a fitted\nmattress sheet;\n\n\"transmitting in a wireless manner feedback such as the sensed temperature or\nhumidity of the space to a location that is beyond confines of the bedding\nclimate control apparatus.\n\n\"delivering forced air into the space in accordance with the commands so as to\ngive rise to an inflated configuration of the space bounded by the bed sheet\nand the fitted mattress sheet or bounded within a layer of bedding\n\n\"imparting thermal energy to the forced airflow with a thermal element in\naccordance with the commands; and\n\n\"operating at least one device to remotely receive the information from the\nbedding climate control apparatus and to send out in a wireless manner the\ncommands.\n\n\"The bedding climate control apparatus is preferably responsive to receipt of\nthe commands to carry out a course of action in accord with the commands, the\ncourse of action being selected from the group consisting of commencement of\nadjustment in a temperature or humidity, setting a change in temperature or\nhumidity as a function of time over a time interval, and carrying out\noperation of the bedding climate control apparatus in a manner that conforms\nwith recall settings from memory storage that are selected from the group\nconsisting of time, temperature, humidity and air flow rate.\n\n\"There is preferably a method of adjusting temperature or humidity within\nbedding, comprising the steps of:\n\n\"equipping a bedding climate control apparatus with components including a\nthermal element that imparts thermal energy to vary a temperature or a\nhumidity in a bed before that of an environment surrounding the bed;\n\n\"operating at least one device in wireless communication with the bedding\nclimate control apparatus to transmit simultaneous and non-simultaneous\ncommands in a wireless manner, the at least one device being selected from the\ngroup consisting of a protocol access enabled device and a remote control\nwireless communication device, the protocol access enabled device being\nselected from the group consisting of Bluetooth protocol access enabled, WiFi\nprotocol access enabled and Zigbee protocol access enabled; and\n\n\"operating the equipped bedding climate control apparatus to receive the\ntransmitted simultaneous and non-simultaneous commands from both the protocol\naccess enabled device and the remote control wireless communication device to\nhave the components vary the temperature or humidity in the bed in a manner\nthat is in accord with the commands.\n\n\"The bedding climate control apparatus is not a room air conditioning system,\nwhich adjusts the temperature or humidity of a whole room even if that room\nhappens to have a bed in it. Room air conditioning systems do eventually\nchange the temperature or humidity of a bed within the room eventually since\nthe bed is within the room, but the environment surrounding the bed has its\ntemperature or humidity changed by the room air conditioning system before\nthat of the bed. The reverse is the case for a bedding climate control\napparatus in accordance with the invention since the components of the\napparatus, including the thermal elements, adjust the temperature or humidity\nof the space between a bed sheet and a fitted sheet initially without\naffecting the surrounding environment at that initial time. After a while,\nthere may be some localized lead through effect on the immediately surrounding\nenvironment that changes the temperature or humidity of that immediately\nsurrounding environment since the bedding is made of fabric that can breathe,\nbut that arises well after the temperature or humidity of the space has begun\nto change.\n\n\"An aspect of the invention reside in a bedding climate control apparatus that\ndelivers, in a quiet manner, forced airflow from a fan/blower within a housing\nto selectively deliver tempered (heated via a ceramic thermal element) and\nuntempered (room temperature) air through an air duct to bedding. The quiet\nmanner is attained by oversizing a size of the housing to accommodate acoustic\nfoam, oversizing a dimension of the fan/blower, oversizing a heating capacity\nof the thermal element, and oversizing a dimension of the flexible hose beyond\nthe size actually needed for efficient operation.\n\n\"The capacity of the housing is oversized beyond that needed to accommodate\njust the fan/blower so that it can accommodate acoustic foam at the air intake\nto dampen sound generation by the fan/blower. The acoustic foam is arranged so\nthere is no direct line of sight between the air supply and the air intake to\nthe fan/blower, thereby forcing air entering the fan/blower to have previously\ndeflected off the acoustic foam to thereby dampen its sound.\n\n\"The capacity of the fan/blower to deliver needed airflow exceeds that\nnecessary for attaining the desired airflow. As a result, the fan/blower is\nrun at quieter speeds than would be the case if it were sized to efficiently\ndeliver the needed airflow. One reason for being able to run the motor of the\nfan/blower at a lower speed is that the pressure drop that the airflow must\novercome to reach the bedding is kept low.\n\n\"In furtherance of this goal, a ceramic thermal element, which is used to heat\nor temper the air flow, is oversized so its capacity exceeds that necessary\nfor the heat delivery needed. As a result, the oversized thermal element can\nheat more of the airflow at a time (than can a smaller dimensioned ceramic\nthermal element) to have the airflow reach a lower temperature than would be\nthe case if it were smaller in dimension. This lower temperature is below the\nflashpoint of dust and lint, which thus do not burn when subjected to heat\nfrom the ceramic thermal element operating at the lower temperature delivery.\nIf the ceramic thermal element were sized smaller it would need to operate to\ndeliver the heat at a higher temperature in order the handle the air flow\nrequirements for tempered airflow.\n\n\"The air duct is oversized to lessen the pressure drop across it for the\nrequired airflow and thus avoid the need to run the motor of the fan/blower at\na higher speed to overcome the pressure drop, which would be the case is the\nair duct were sized smaller to be suited to handle the full air flow volume.\n\n\"A further aspect is to sense air temperature of the airflow emerging from a\ndischarge of the blower/fan and from an air delivery outlet so as to vary a\ntemperature of the forced air being delivered to bedding as necessary to\nmaintain substantially a constant temperature throughout a time interval, as\nwell as to shut off heating power in the event that the airflow temperature is\nto high as to risk reaching burn temperature.\n\n\"Another aspect is to vary a setting of the temperature of the forced air\nbeing delivered to bedding as time passes. Still another aspect is to deliver\nthe force air to bedding initially at a maximum temperature setting for a\nrelatively short duration such as ten minutes to provide maximum heating and\nto automatically thereafter change the temperature setting to a lower\ntemperature for a relatively longer duration (such as overnight). Yet another\naspect resides in controlling the bedding climate control apparatus with a\nwireless remote control unit and with a blue-tooth protocol access enabled\nwireless smart phone at the same time or at different times. The control may\ninclude commencement of forced airflow, heating of the forced airflow, setting\na change in temperature of the heated forced airflow as a function of time\nover a time interval, recall time, temperature and air flow rate settings from\nmemory storage, setting an alarm to automatically turn on and off the bedding\nclimate control apparatus at specific times. The smart phone may work in\nconjunction with a software application retrieved from the internet to\ninteract with the bedding climate control apparatus.\n\n\"Still another aspect resides in delivering heating power at a level that\nprevents tripping a conventional electrical circuit of a household and in\npreventing high heat delivery from potentially burning skin of a person under\ncertain conditions by delivering between 1000 watts of heating power to a\nmaximum of 1500 watts of heating power inclusive and heating the forced air to\na maximum set temperature substantially at 46 degrees Celsius maximum or below\n(114 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\"An additional aspect resides in a longitudinally expandable/compressible\nflexible hose that keeps its interior air passage dimension intact even when\nlongitudinally compressed and flexed to bend. The longitudinally\nexpandable/compressible flexible hose has a steel wire wound inside to\nmaintain the air passage dimension intact. The entire flexible hose may be\nsheathed within a stretchable manmade fabric such as spandex, or non-\nstretchable material.\n\n\"Another aspect resides in the fan/blower being operated with a DC brushless\nmotor that enables 0-100% adjustability in motor power so that airflow from\nthe fan/blower powered by the motor permits airflow adjustment increments of\nas small as 5%. Thus, a user could adjust the airflow delivery volume to any\nof 20 settings at 5% increments from 0 to 100%. Certainly, 10 settings at 10%\nincrements could be done instead if desired within the range of 0 to 100%\npower. That would still be preferable to the limited three choices available\nconventionally for blowers of just low, medium or high.\n\n\"A further aspect resides in a bed sheet retention unit that has clamps that\nclamp onto a bed sheet to keep its position over the air delivery outlet\nnozzle. This helps to ensure that airflow will enter the space between the\nupper sheet and lower fitted mattress sheet regardless of how the occupant of\nthe bed might move them during sleep. Since there are platform beds that have\na raised lip about their periphery, the bed sheet retention unit has two\nhorizontally disposed segments jointed to each other by a vertically disposed\nsegment (riser), which rises to an elevation that is higher than the\nperipheral wall of the conventional partition bed. As an alternative, the air\nconduit may provide the retention function by providing the clamps at the end\nof the air conduit.\n\n\"Preferably, the housing of the bedding climate control apparatus should be\nsized to fit beneath conventional beds and thus be up to seven inches in\nheight. Therefore the bedding climate control apparatus sits next to or under\nthe foot of the bed and sends forced hot or cool air in between the bedding\ntop sheet and bottom fitted mattress sheet via the air delivery outlet nozzle,\nwhich is small and unobtrusive and is anchored at the bottom corner of the\nbed.\n\n\"Once activated, the blower/fan, flexible hose and air delivery outlet nozzle\noperate at a very specific air pressure to quietly generate a small cushion of\nturbulent air between the upper bedding sheet and lower fitted mattress sheet\nthat lifts the top bedding sheet off the fitted mattress sheet by a few\ninches. This tenting effect on the bedding combined with the airflow that\nfollows enables the bedding climate control apparatus air to permeate\nthroughout the entire sleeping area and provide even heating or cooling.\nAlternatively the forced air may be blown in between layers of bedding, or\ninto layers of bedding containing hollow flow cavities in accord with U.S.\nutility patent application publication no. 2017-0164758 A1\n\n\"For heating, the bedding climate control apparatus is operated to heat three\nto five minutes before getting into bed to achieve a 30 degrees F. bedding\npre-heat, or for short bursts while already in bed. For cooling, turn the\nclimate control apparatus on while in bed. It is quiet, the bedding climate\ncontrol apparatus emits much less noise than a room air conditioner.\n\n\"Another aspect resides in a grille within the exhaust air passage of\nthe/blower/fan that prevents fingers from reaching through the exhaust air\npassage live electrical components within the fan/blower despite the dimension\nof the exhaust air passage being large enough in dimension to enable fingers\nto fit in. This relatively larger size exhaust air passage means that the\nfan/blower can deliver the necessary volume of airflow with a lesser pressure\ndrop through the air duct than would otherwise be the case if sized smaller.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"What is claimed is:\n\n\"1\\.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Telecommunications Daily</org> -- According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.alxdra\">Alexandria, Virginia</location>, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventor Aramli, <person>Mark Darius</person> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ri.newpor\">Newport, RI</location>), filed on <chron>April 1, 2019</chron>, was published online on <chron>June 8, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The assignee for this patent, patent number 10,660,451, is <org>Bedjet LLC</org> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ri.newpor\">Newport, Rhode Island</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>).</p>\n<p>Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;Technical Field of the Invention</p>\n<p>&#8220;The invention is a home appliance that provides very rapid heating of a bed via forced heated air prior to the user entering the bed, or while the user is in the bed and also provides a cooling effect after the user has entered the bed via fresh room temperature air being forced into the bedding. That is, the invention relates to supplying forced air, which may be heated, within a space between a fitted mattress sheet and a bedding sheet or within a layer of bedding. Further, a wireless protocol access device is used to send commands remotely to the bedding climate control apparatus that affect operating parameters of the apparatus and includes setting the temperature of a space between a fitted mattress sheet and a bed sheet by delivery of forced air, which may be heated with heating power as warranted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Description of Related Art</p>\n<p>&#8220;Current control of the temperature of a bed relies on electric blankets or electric mattress pads. These devices are limited in their wattage capability and typically take 30 to 45 minutes to raise the temperature of bedding by 20 degrees F. As well, they provide no means to cool the user. They also provide no circulation of fresh air into the bedding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some products are currently in use in the medical field that provide forced air bed heating to patients in surgical recovery rooms. These devices cannot be used without proprietary gowns with airflow channels or perforated sheets with airflow channels that must be connected to the forced air heater for distribution of the heat to the patient. These products are also not used for cooling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Electric Blanket Institute finds that the average electric blanket puts out less than 200 watts of heating power, and some portion of this energy is emitted to the topside of the blanket into the bedroom.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Electric blankets have embedded wires, which one can feel and these wires can be chewed on by pets or damaged by children and sharp objects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many electric blankets aren&#8217;t reliable after repeated washings or have very special washing and drying instructions that must be followed. The present inventor has found by observing through an IR camera that wires of a brand new blanket purchased from a major department store after 45 minutes on &#8216;Hi&#8217; setting do not provide even heating. Older electric blankets cause hundreds of fires a year from wires in the bed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is desired to deliver heat to bedding and sheets or to provide the sensation of cooling to a person within the bedding and sheets, all under direction from a bedside remote control. In so doing, it is desired to deliver to bedding and sheets more dry heating power than is available from electric blankets in a safe and quiet manner at a temperature that is the same as provided by a household HVAC central air-heating unit, and forced ambient temperature air in a controllable fashion&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent: &#8220;The present invention pertains to a method and means of operation of a bedding climate control apparatus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That is, In response to wireless receipt of commands by a bedding climate control apparatus of the present invention, the bedding climate control apparatus varies a temperature or humidity of a space between a bed sheet and a fitted mattress sheet or within a layer of bedding in accordance with the commands. Preferably, the bedding climate control apparatus is responsive to simultaneous and non-simultaneous receipt of commands from both a protocol access enabled device and a remote control wireless communication device to vary, in accordance with the commands, the temperature or humidity within a space between a bed sheet and a fitted mattress sheet or within a layer of bedding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The operation of the bedding climate control apparatus may be equipped with appropriate means to perform the following steps or functions:</p>\n<p>&#8220;receiving commands with a signal receiver of the bedding climate control apparatus;</p>\n<p>&#8220;sensing the temperature or humidity of the space between bedding and a fitted mattress sheet;</p>\n<p>&#8220;transmitting in a wireless manner feedback such as the sensed temperature or humidity of the space to a location that is beyond confines of the bedding climate control apparatus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;delivering forced air into the space in accordance with the commands so as to give rise to an inflated configuration of the space bounded by the bed sheet and the fitted mattress sheet or bounded within a layer of bedding</p>\n<p>&#8220;imparting thermal energy to the forced airflow with a thermal element in accordance with the commands; and</p>\n<p>&#8220;operating at least one device to remotely receive the information from the bedding climate control apparatus and to send out in a wireless manner the commands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The bedding climate control apparatus is preferably responsive to receipt of the commands to carry out a course of action in accord with the commands, the course of action being selected from the group consisting of commencement of adjustment in a temperature or humidity, setting a change in temperature or humidity as a function of time over a time interval, and carrying out operation of the bedding climate control apparatus in a manner that conforms with recall settings from memory storage that are selected from the group consisting of time, temperature, humidity and air flow rate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is preferably a method of adjusting temperature or humidity within bedding, comprising the steps of:</p>\n<p>&#8220;equipping a bedding climate control apparatus with components including a thermal element that imparts thermal energy to vary a temperature or a humidity in a bed before that of an environment surrounding the bed;</p>\n<p>&#8220;operating at least one device in wireless communication with the bedding climate control apparatus to transmit simultaneous and non-simultaneous commands in a wireless manner, the at least one device being selected from the group consisting of a protocol access enabled device and a remote control wireless communication device, the protocol access enabled device being selected from the group consisting of Bluetooth protocol access enabled, WiFi protocol access enabled and Zigbee protocol access enabled; and</p>\n<p>&#8220;operating the equipped bedding climate control apparatus to receive the transmitted simultaneous and non-simultaneous commands from both the protocol access enabled device and the remote control wireless communication device to have the components vary the temperature or humidity in the bed in a manner that is in accord with the commands.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The bedding climate control apparatus is not a room air conditioning system, which adjusts the temperature or humidity of a whole room even if that room happens to have a bed in it. Room air conditioning systems do eventually change the temperature or humidity of a bed within the room eventually since the bed is within the room, but the environment surrounding the bed has its temperature or humidity changed by the room air conditioning system before that of the bed. The reverse is the case for a bedding climate control apparatus in accordance with the invention since the components of the apparatus, including the thermal elements, adjust the temperature or humidity of the space between a bed sheet and a fitted sheet initially without affecting the surrounding environment at that initial time. After a while, there may be some localized lead through effect on the immediately surrounding environment that changes the temperature or humidity of that immediately surrounding environment since the bedding is made of fabric that can breathe, but that arises well after the temperature or humidity of the space has begun to change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An aspect of the invention reside in a bedding climate control apparatus that delivers, in a quiet manner, forced airflow from a fan/blower within a housing to selectively deliver tempered (heated via a ceramic thermal element) and untempered (room temperature) air through an air duct to bedding. The quiet manner is attained by oversizing a size of the housing to accommodate acoustic foam, oversizing a dimension of the fan/blower, oversizing a heating capacity of the thermal element, and oversizing a dimension of the flexible hose beyond the size actually needed for efficient operation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The capacity of the housing is oversized beyond that needed to accommodate just the fan/blower so that it can accommodate acoustic foam at the air intake to dampen sound generation by the fan/blower. The acoustic foam is arranged so there is no direct line of sight between the air supply and the air intake to the fan/blower, thereby forcing air entering the fan/blower to have previously deflected off the acoustic foam to thereby dampen its sound.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The capacity of the fan/blower to deliver needed airflow exceeds that necessary for attaining the desired airflow. As a result, the fan/blower is run at quieter speeds than would be the case if it were sized to efficiently deliver the needed airflow. One reason for being able to run the motor of the fan/blower at a lower speed is that the pressure drop that the airflow must overcome to reach the bedding is kept low.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In furtherance of this goal, a ceramic thermal element, which is used to heat or temper the air flow, is oversized so its capacity exceeds that necessary for the heat delivery needed. As a result, the oversized thermal element can heat more of the airflow at a time (than can a smaller dimensioned ceramic thermal element) to have the airflow reach a lower temperature than would be the case if it were smaller in dimension. This lower temperature is below the flashpoint of dust and lint, which thus do not burn when subjected to heat from the ceramic thermal element operating at the lower temperature delivery. If the ceramic thermal element were sized smaller it would need to operate to deliver the heat at a higher temperature in order the handle the air flow requirements for tempered airflow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The air duct is oversized to lessen the pressure drop across it for the required airflow and thus avoid the need to run the motor of the fan/blower at a higher speed to overcome the pressure drop, which would be the case is the air duct were sized smaller to be suited to handle the full air flow volume.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A further aspect is to sense air temperature of the airflow emerging from a discharge of the blower/fan and from an air delivery outlet so as to vary a temperature of the forced air being delivered to bedding as necessary to maintain substantially a constant temperature throughout a time interval, as well as to shut off heating power in the event that the airflow temperature is to high as to risk reaching burn temperature.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another aspect is to vary a setting of the temperature of the forced air being delivered to bedding as time passes. Still another aspect is to deliver the force air to bedding initially at a maximum temperature setting for a relatively short duration such as ten minutes to provide maximum heating and to automatically thereafter change the temperature setting to a lower temperature for a relatively longer duration (such as overnight). Yet another aspect resides in controlling the bedding climate control apparatus with a wireless remote control unit and with a blue-tooth protocol access enabled wireless smart phone at the same time or at different times. The control may include commencement of forced airflow, heating of the forced airflow, setting a change in temperature of the heated forced airflow as a function of time over a time interval, recall time, temperature and air flow rate settings from memory storage, setting an alarm to automatically turn on and off the bedding climate control apparatus at specific times. The smart phone may work in conjunction with a software application retrieved from the internet to interact with the bedding climate control apparatus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Still another aspect resides in delivering heating power at a level that prevents tripping a conventional electrical circuit of a household and in preventing high heat delivery from potentially burning skin of a person under certain conditions by delivering between 1000 watts of heating power to a maximum of 1500 watts of heating power inclusive and heating the forced air to a maximum set temperature substantially at 46 degrees Celsius maximum or below (114 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>&#8220;An additional aspect resides in a longitudinally expandable/compressible flexible hose that keeps its interior air passage dimension intact even when longitudinally compressed and flexed to bend. The longitudinally expandable/compressible flexible hose has a steel wire wound inside to maintain the air passage dimension intact. The entire flexible hose may be sheathed within a stretchable manmade fabric such as spandex, or non-stretchable material.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another aspect resides in the fan/blower being operated with a DC brushless motor that enables 0-100% adjustability in motor power so that airflow from the fan/blower powered by the motor permits airflow adjustment increments of as small as 5%. Thus, a user could adjust the airflow delivery volume to any of 20 settings at 5% increments from 0 to 100%. Certainly, 10 settings at 10% increments could be done instead if desired within the range of 0 to 100% power. That would still be preferable to the limited three choices available conventionally for blowers of just low, medium or high.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A further aspect resides in a bed sheet retention unit that has clamps that clamp onto a bed sheet to keep its position over the air delivery outlet nozzle. This helps to ensure that airflow will enter the space between the upper sheet and lower fitted mattress sheet regardless of how the occupant of the bed might move them during sleep. Since there are platform beds that have a raised lip about their periphery, the bed sheet retention unit has two horizontally disposed segments jointed to each other by a vertically disposed segment (riser), which rises to an elevation that is higher than the peripheral wall of the conventional partition bed. As an alternative, the air conduit may provide the retention function by providing the clamps at the end of the air conduit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Preferably, the housing of the bedding climate control apparatus should be sized to fit beneath conventional beds and thus be up to seven inches in height. Therefore the bedding climate control apparatus sits next to or under the foot of the bed and sends forced hot or cool air in between the bedding top sheet and bottom fitted mattress sheet via the air delivery outlet nozzle, which is small and unobtrusive and is anchored at the bottom corner of the bed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once activated, the blower/fan, flexible hose and air delivery outlet nozzle operate at a very specific air pressure to quietly generate a small cushion of turbulent air between the upper bedding sheet and lower fitted mattress sheet that lifts the top bedding sheet off the fitted mattress sheet by a few inches. This tenting effect on the bedding combined with the airflow that follows enables the bedding climate control apparatus air to permeate throughout the entire sleeping area and provide even heating or cooling. Alternatively the forced air may be blown in between layers of bedding, or into layers of bedding containing hollow flow cavities in accord with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> utility patent application publication no. 2017-0164758 A1</p>\n<p>&#8220;For heating, the bedding climate control apparatus is operated to heat three to five minutes before getting into bed to achieve a 30 degrees F. bedding pre-heat, or for short bursts while already in bed. For cooling, turn the climate control apparatus on while in bed. It is quiet, the bedding climate control apparatus emits much less noise than a room air conditioner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another aspect resides in a grille within the exhaust air passage of the/blower/fan that prevents fingers from reaching through the exhaust air passage live electrical components within the fan/blower despite the dimension of the exhaust air passage being large enough in dimension to enable fingers to fit in. This relatively larger size exhaust air passage means that the fan/blower can deliver the necessary volume of airflow with a lesser pressure drop through the air duct than would otherwise be the case if sized smaller.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;What is claimed is:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
