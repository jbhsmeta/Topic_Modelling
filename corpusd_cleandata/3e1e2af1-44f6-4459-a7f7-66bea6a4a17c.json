The agency is seeking to develop future analyses in a consistent\nmanner that includes all relevant information, helping to ensure the agency's\nactions are justified and supported by the latest in economic, engineering,\nbiological and physical sciences.\n\n\"Federal regulations often impose significant compliance costs, in terms of\ntime and money, which is why we've worked to streamline federal rules and\nprovide relief from unnecessary and burdensome regulations,\" said Hoeven. \"It\nmakes sense to ensure that the benefits of the administration's actions\noutweigh the costs, and to do so in a consistent and transparent manner. We\nwelcome the EPA's effort to do just that, and we encourage North Dakotans from\nacross sectors, including agriculture, energy and construction, to give their\ninput on this proposal.\"\n\nThe EPA is accepting public comments on the proposal for the next 45 days.\nComments may be submitted online here or by e-mail, attention to Docket ID No.\nEPA-HQ-OAR-2020-00044.",
