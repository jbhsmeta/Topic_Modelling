    "text": "When most - but not all - nonessential retail businesses in New Jersey are\nallowed to reopen June 15 with shoppers inside stores, capacity will be\nlimited to 50% and both customers and employees will be required to wear face\ncoverings to protect against the coronavirus.\n\nOne major caveat: Nonessential stores at indoor malls are still not allowed to\nreopen yet, unless they have a separate entrance.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy laid out those safety restrictions and guidelines Thursday as\nthe state prepares to enter Stage 2 of its multiphase reopening plan after\nnearly three months of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nThe second stage begins June 15, with restaurants and bars permitted to offer\noutdoor dining and nonessential retail stores permitted to have patrons inside\nafter first being closed and then being limited to curbside service for the\nlast few weeks. Murphy outlined restrictions on outdoor dining Wednesday.\n\n\"So long as we continue practicing social distancing, and so long as retailers\ndo all we are requiring of them to protect their stores and their customers,\nwe will take a\n\nbig step forward in our restart and recovery,\" Murphy said during his daily\ncoronavirus briefing in Trenton.\n\n\"While it may seem odd for us to be wearing a face covering in our favorite\nlocal shop, with a store owner who may be our neighbor and friend, we have to\nrecognize that this virus remains among us,\" the governor added. \"COVID-19\ndoesn't care whether we're in a supermarket or a bookstore. Social distancing\nmust remain our routine.\"\n\nAs for malls? Those have been closed since March 17 and will remain shuttered\nuntil further notice, Murphy said.\n\n\"We're not there on malls,\" he said.\n\nMatt Platkin, the governor's chief counsel, said they are \"one of the\nindustries we're looking at\" to reopen.\n\nThe rules for other nonessential stores are similar to those the state ordered\nat essential stores April 8.\n\nCustomers and employees who have medical reasons not to wear a face covering\nwill be exempt, the governor said.\n\nStores must also provide special shopping hours for high-risk individuals\nwherever possible, put up physical barriers between customers and cashiers or\nbaggers, and regularly sanitize areas used by employees, Murphy said.\n\n\"We already have good practice with these protocols since, as I mentioned,\nthey have been in place in our essential retail spaces for nearly two months,\"\nthe governor said. \"As customers, we know the drill.\"\n\nNo local towns may order additional restrictions on either essential or\nnonessential businesses, Murphy said.\n\n\"There is one set of rules for everyone, whether you're in Newton or Cape May,\nor Belmar or Cherry Hill,\" he said.\n\nMurphy ordered all nonessential retail stores to close March 21 when he\ninstalled sweeping stay-at-home orders to slow the virus. Essential stores -\nsuch as supermarkets and some big-box stores - have been allowed to stay open.\n\nBut the governor has been slowly lifting his restrictions in recent weeks as\nthe Garden State's outbreak has slowed steadily - and as the state's economy\nstruggles mightily.\n\nMore than 1.2 million New Jersey residents have filed for unemployment since\naggressive social distancing started in mid-March, causing the state's\nunemployment rate to surge to 15.3%, though the number of new claims has\nfallen in recent weeks.\n\nMurphy allowed nonessential stores to offer curbside pickup May 18.\n\nEarlier this week, he announced Stage 2 would begin June 15 with outdoor\ndining and nonessential retail reopening. Hair salons and barbershops will\nfollow June 22.\n\nGyms, libraries, museums and some government offices - such as motor vehicle\nservices - are also expected to reopen during the stage, though there is not a\ntimeline yet for those.\n\nThe governor said these moves are safe not only because the metrics are\ndropping, but because the state has ramped up testing and is expanding contact\ntracers that will allow officials to more easily track any coronavirus spikes.\n\nSome lawmakers, businesses and residents have continuously pressed Murphy to\nmove more quickly to reopen the state because stores can put safety\nprecautions in place.\n\nThe governor has repeatedly said he's being cautious to make sure deaths and\ncases don't spike again.\n\nIn April, the New Jersey Business and Industry Association released a survey\nof 1,359 businesses that found more than half said they would struggle to\nbreak even if their access to customers was cut in half.\n\nOne in five business owners said they would never return to pre-coronavirus\nrevenues if they open only at 50% capacity. Another quarter said it would take\nthem at least a year, while 6% said it would take at least two years. Just 9%\nsaid they could get back to the same level of business in less than three\nmonths.\n\nNew Jersey, a densely populated state of 9 million residents, has reported\n11,970 known deaths attributed to COVID-19, with at least 162,530 cases, since\nthe first confirmed case here on March 4. Only New York state has more deaths\nand cases.\n\nState officials on Thursday reported 92 new deaths and 603 new cases in New\nJersey.\n\nMeanwhile, hospitalizations for the virus fell below 2,000 as of Wednesday\nnight - the first time the state has been under that mark in more than two\nmonths.\n\nAbout 43% of lab-confirmed deaths have been of residents and staff members of\nthe state's long-term care facilities, such as nursing and veteran homes.\n\nMurphy has already allowed parks, beaches, boardwalks, and lakes in New Jersey\nto reopen. He increased the limit on outdoor gatherings to 25. Indoor\ngatherings remain capped at 10.\n\nThe governor announced last week that child day care centers in New Jersey can\nreopen June 15, outdoor, noncontact organized sports can resume June 22, and\nyouth day camps can operate beginning July 6, all with restrictions.\n\nThe governor also said live horse racing can return, without fans, as early as\nthis weekend. Additionally,he said the state is hoping to allow larger indoor\ngatherings, including those at churches and other houses of worship, by the\nweekend of June 12.\n\nBrent Johnson, NJ Advance Media,\n[bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com](mailto:bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com)",

    "title": "What's in store when retail gets a lift June 15   Retail   Next phase allows indoor shopping, outdoor dining",
    "html": "<p>When most - but not all - nonessential retail businesses in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> are allowed to reopen <chron>June 15</chron> with shoppers inside stores, capacity will be limited to 50% and both customers and employees will be required to wear face coverings to protect against the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>One major caveat: Nonessential stores at indoor malls are still not allowed to reopen yet, unless they have a separate entrance.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. <person>Phil Murphy</person> laid out those safety restrictions and guidelines Thursday as the state prepares to enter Stage 2 of its multiphase reopening plan after nearly three months of coronavirus restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>The second stage begins <chron>June 15</chron>, with restaurants and bars permitted to offer outdoor dining and nonessential retail stores permitted to have patrons inside after first being closed and then being limited to curbside service for the last few weeks. Murphy outlined restrictions on outdoor dining Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>\"So long as we continue practicing social distancing, and so long as retailers do all we are requiring of them to protect their stores and their customers, we will take a</p>\n\n<p>big step forward in our restart and recovery,\" Murphy said during his daily coronavirus briefing in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"While it may seem odd for us to be wearing a face covering in our favorite local shop, with a store owner who may be our neighbor and friend, we have to recognize that this virus remains among us,\" the governor added. \"COVID-19 doesn't care whether we're in a supermarket or a bookstore. Social distancing must remain our routine.\"</p>\n\n<p>As for malls? Those have been closed since <chron>March 17</chron> and will remain shuttered until further notice, Murphy said.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're not there on malls,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Matt Platkin</person>, the governor's chief counsel, said they are \"one of the industries we're looking at\" to reopen.</p>\n\n<p>The rules for other nonessential stores are similar to those the state ordered at essential stores <chron>April 8</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Customers and employees who have medical reasons not to wear a face covering will be exempt, the governor said.</p>\n\n<p>Stores must also provide special shopping hours for high-risk individuals wherever possible, put up physical barriers between customers and cashiers or baggers, and regularly sanitize areas used by employees, Murphy said.</p>\n\n<p>\"We already have good practice with these protocols since, as I mentioned, they have been in place in our essential retail spaces for nearly two months,\" the governor said. \"As customers, we know the drill.\"</p>\n\n<p>No local towns may order additional restrictions on either essential or nonessential businesses, Murphy said.</p>\n\n<p>\"There is one set of rules for everyone, whether you're in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.newton\">Newton</location> or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.capmay\">Cape May</location>, or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.belmar\">Belmar</location> or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.cheill\">Cherry Hill</location>,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Murphy ordered all nonessential retail stores to close <chron>March 21</chron> when he installed sweeping stay-at-home orders to slow the virus. Essential stores - such as supermarkets and some big-box stores - have been allowed to stay open.</p>\n\n<p>But the governor has been slowly lifting his restrictions in recent weeks as the Garden State's outbreak has slowed steadily - and as the state's economy struggles mightily.</p>\n\n<p>More than 1.2 million <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> residents have filed for unemployment since aggressive social distancing started in mid-March, causing the state's unemployment rate to surge to 15.3%, though the number of new claims has fallen in recent weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Murphy allowed nonessential stores to offer curbside pickup <chron>May 18</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week, he announced Stage 2 would begin <chron>June 15</chron> with outdoor dining and nonessential retail reopening. Hair salons and barbershops will follow <chron>June 22</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Gyms, libraries, museums and some government offices - such as motor vehicle services - are also expected to reopen during the stage, though there is not a timeline yet for those.</p>\n\n<p>The governor said these moves are safe not only because the metrics are dropping, but because the state has ramped up testing and is expanding contact tracers that will allow officials to more easily track any coronavirus spikes.</p>\n\n<p>Some lawmakers, businesses and residents have continuously pressed Murphy to move more quickly to reopen the state because stores can put safety precautions in place.</p>\n\n<p>The governor has repeatedly said he's being cautious to make sure deaths and cases don't spike again.</p>\n\n<p>In April, the <org>New Jersey Business and Industry Association</org> released a survey of 1,359 businesses that found more than half said they would struggle to break even if their access to customers was cut in half.</p>\n\n<p>One in five business owners said they would never return to pre-coronavirus revenues if they open only at 50% capacity. Another quarter said it would take them at least a year, while 6% said it would take at least two years. Just 9% said they could get back to the same level of business in less than three months.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, a densely populated state of 9 million residents, has reported 11,970 known deaths attributed to COVID-19, with at least 162,530 cases, since the first confirmed case here on <chron>March 4</chron>. Only <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ny\">New York state</location> has more deaths and cases.</p>\n\n<p>State officials on Thursday reported 92 new deaths and 603 new cases in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, hospitalizations for the virus fell below 2,000 as of Wednesday night - the first time the state has been under that mark in more than two months.</p>\n\n<p>About 43% of lab-confirmed deaths have been of residents and staff members of the state's long-term care facilities, such as nursing and veteran homes.</p>\n\n<p>Murphy has already allowed parks, beaches, boardwalks, and lakes in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> to reopen. He increased the limit on outdoor gatherings to 25. Indoor gatherings remain capped at 10.</p>\n\n<p>The governor announced last week that child day care centers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> can reopen <chron>June 15</chron>, outdoor, noncontact organized sports can resume <chron>June 22</chron>, and youth day camps can operate beginning <chron>July 6</chron>, all with restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>The governor also said live horse racing can return, without fans, as early as this weekend. Additionally,he said the state is hoping to allow larger indoor gatherings, including those at churches and other houses of worship, by the weekend of <chron>June 12</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Brent Johnson, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2655353283\">NJ Advance Media</org>, <a href=\"mailto:bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com\">bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com</a></p>",
