Patil said that many people have started complaining that\nhall owners are insisting on rescheduling of dates and are not willing to\nrefund the money.Meanwhile, during the recent visit of district in-charge\nMinister, Shashikala Jolle, some people urged the Minister to take action\nagainst such wedding hall owners. They said that only a few are thinking of\nrescheduling the dates, while several of them are not certain of any date and\nare asking for the refund.\"The hall owners have no right to keep the money\nwhen they are not offering any service. Keeping money without any service is\nillegal\", said one of the complainants.fter the complaint, Ms. Jolle asked\nDeputy Commissioner to take necessary action to meet the demand of the\npeople.Based on it, Mr. Patil said that action under the Disaster Management\nct would be taken against errant owners of wedding halls and convention\ncentres.The owners should refund the full amount, he added.You have reached\nyour limit for free articles this month.
