    "text": "LAKE COUNTY, Calif. \u0096 The California Highway Patrol is continuing its\ninvestigation into a Tuesday afternoon rollover crash near Kelseyville that\ninjured two people.\n\nThe CHP's Clear Lake Area office issued a Wednesday report on the crash, which\noccurred at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday at Highway 29 and Bell Hill Road.\n\nThe report said the crash involved a 2016 Ford Explorer driven by 35-year-old\nDenice Guistolise of Kelseyville, who had two female juveniles from\nKelseyville in the vehicle with her, and Debora Lynn Larson, 58, of Santa\nRosa, who had a male juvenile from Clearlake riding as her passenger in her\n2000 Mercury Mountaineer.\n\nThe CHP said Guistolise was driving her Ford eastbound on Bell Hill Road and\nstopped at the intersection on the west side of Highway 29.\n\nLarson was driving southbound on Highway 29, north of the intersection of Bell\nHill Road, at an unknown speed, the CHP said.\n\nGuistolise proceeded into the intersection, directly into Larson's path of\ntravel, resulting in a broadside collision, the report explained.\n\nThe impact of the initial collision caused Larson's vehicle to veer off the\nright side of the roadway where it then rolled multiple times and landed\nupside down on the west shoulder of Highway 29, the CHP said.\n\nThe CHP said Larson had to be extricated by emergency personnel and was\ntransported by REACH air ambulance to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital for\nmoderate injuries sustained as a result of the collision.\n\nThe male juvenile passenger in Larson's vehicle was also transported by REACH\nto Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital for moderate injuries, the CHP said.\n\nGuistolise and her two passengers were uninjured, according to the report.\n\nThe CHP said seat belts were worn by all occupants in both vehicles.\n\nBased on the investigation so far, the CHP said it appears that neither\nalcohol nor drugs were factors in the cause of the collision.\n\nThe cause of the collision is still under investigation, the CHP said.\n\nEmail Elizabeth Larson at\n[elarson@lakeconews.com](mailto:elarson@lakeconews.com) .
