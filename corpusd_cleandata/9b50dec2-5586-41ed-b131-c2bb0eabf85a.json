    "text": "Columbus: The College of Wooster has issued the following news release:\n\nAs the leader of the nation's largest not-for-profit organization focused on\nadvocating for the interests of America's children, Max Lesko '06 frequently\nleans on his Wooster experience to successfully champion his cause and make\nthe greatest impact.\n\nLesko took over as executive director of the National Children's Defense Fund\nin D.C. at the end of 2018 after serving as chief of staff for CDF's founder\nand president emerita Marian Edelman. \"Working with her grew my appreciation\nfor putting the challenges we see today in the context of history,\nunderstanding the roots of systems that stymie progress,\" said Lesko. As\nexecutive director, he oversees the organization's day-to-day operations and\nreports to the Board of Directors. His efforts include policy advocacy and\nprogram development to help lift children out of poverty; protect them from\nabuse and neglect; and ensure their access to health care, quality education\nand a moral and spiritual foundation. Amid the evolving COVID-19 crisis, CDF\nhas worked to provide free digital education tools for parents and caregivers\nduring school closings, and to support passage of crucial legislation, like\nthe Families First Coronavirus Response Act. \"Our team has met this moment\ndelivering programs through new, virtual platforms, and assessing the novel\ncircumstances and expanded needs of families facing economic challenges,\" said\nLesko.\n\n\"The fact that Wooster is not an environment where students trudge from their\ndorm room to a lecture hall and back meant four years of deep engagement with\nthe academic and social community that prepared me well for my current role,\"\nLesko said. \"My role requires a lot of written and verbal communication, as\nwell as engagement with people inside and outside the organization. Wooster's\nfocus on writing through Independent Study, the small classes that force\nparticipation, and my experience in Moot Court set a foundation for strong\ncommunication skills,\" he said.\n\nLesko's political science major and international relations minor helped to\nlaunch him into his first big gig on President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign\nand later as an eight-year member of the Obama Administration in the White\nHouse Presidential Personnel Office and the White House Counsel's Office. He\nearned his law degree from Georgetown University Law Center taking night\nclasses while working in the White House so he could make use of \"legal tools\nas a force for social justice.\" Before joining CDF, Max served as the Chief of\nStaff for the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education from\n2015 through 2017. He also has worked for the Southern Poverty Law Center, the\nLawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the U.S. Commission on\nCivil Rights.\n\nLesko said that his Wooster experiences, like Independent Study, taught him\n\"all of the confusion and nuance that goes into trying to answer big questions\nabout the world\" and also about the intersectionality of the political space.\n\"Most personally,\" he said, \"it taught me how to focus-- to devote a serious\namount of time and energy to a single topic. I have found that type of focus\ncritical to success throughout my professional career.\"",

    "html": "<p>Columbus: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1487511659\">The College of Wooster</org> has issued the following news\nrelease:</p>\n\n<p>As the leader of the nation's largest not-for-profit\norganization focused on advocating for the interests of America's\nchildren, <person>Max Lesko</person> '06 frequently leans on his Wooster experience\nto successfully champion his cause and make the greatest impact.</p>\n\n<p>Lesko took over as executive director of the <org>National\nChildren's Defense Fund</org> in D.C. at the end of 2018 after serving as\nchief of staff for CDF's founder and president emerita <person>Marian\nEdelman</person>. \"Working with her grew my appreciation for putting the\nchallenges we see today in the context of history, understanding the\nroots of systems that stymie progress,\" said Lesko. As executive\ndirector, he oversees the organization's day-to-day operations and\nreports to the Board of Directors. His efforts include policy advocacy\nand program development to help lift children out of poverty; protect\nthem from abuse and neglect; and ensure their access to health care,\nquality education and a moral and spiritual foundation. Amid the\nevolving COVID-19 crisis, CDF has worked to provide free digital\neducation tools for parents and caregivers during school closings, and\nto support passage of crucial legislation, like the Families First\nCoronavirus Response Act. \"Our team has met this moment delivering\nprograms through new, virtual platforms, and assessing the novel\ncircumstances and expanded needs of families facing economic\nchallenges,\" said Lesko.</p>\n\n<p>\"The fact that Wooster is not an environment where students\ntrudge from their dorm room to a lecture hall and back meant four years\nof deep engagement with the academic and social community that prepared\nme well for my current role,\" Lesko said. \"My role requires a\nlot of written and verbal communication, as well as engagement with\npeople inside and outside the organization. Wooster's focus on\nwriting through Independent Study, the small classes that force\nparticipation, and my experience in Moot Court set a foundation for\nstrong communication skills,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Lesko's political science major and international relations\nminor helped to launch him into his first big gig on President <person>Barack\nObama's</person> 2008 campaign and later as an eight-year member of the\n<org>Obama Administration</org> in the <org>White House Presidential Personnel Office</org>\nand the White House Counsel's Office. He earned his law degree from\n<org>Georgetown University Law Center</org> taking night classes while working in\nthe <org>White House</org> so he could make use of \"legal tools as a force for\nsocial justice.\" Before joining CDF, Max served as the Chief of\nStaff for the <org>Office for Civil Rights</org> at the <org>U.S. Department of\nEducation</org> from 2015 through 2017. He also has worked for the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0968680844\">Southern\nPoverty Law Center</org>, the <org>Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under\nLaw</org>, and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3625861234\">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Lesko said that his Wooster experiences, like Independent Study,\ntaught him \"all of the confusion and nuance that goes into trying\nto answer big questions about the world\" and also about the\nintersectionality of the political space. \"Most personally,\"\nhe said, \"it taught me how to focus-- to devote a serious amount of\ntime and energy to a single topic. I have found that type of focus\ncritical to success throughout my professional career.\"</p>",
