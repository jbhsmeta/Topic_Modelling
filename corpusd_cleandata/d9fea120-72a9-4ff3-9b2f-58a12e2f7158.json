    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (ABC4 News) \u0096 Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown\nreleased a statement on Sunday regarding the officer seen shoving a man with a\ncane to the ground during Saturday's protests.\n\nThe incident occured while ABC4 reporter Nicole Neuman and photojournalist\nJosh Witzel was covering the riots live from downtown Salt Lake City Saturday\nnight. While reporting, viewers witnessed an armed police officer shove a man\nwith a cane to the ground. Shortly after, other officers helped the man to his\nfeet.\n\n\"We have spent hours sifting through the footage to identify the officer\ninvolved, we know who it is and we have begun the investigation,\" said Brown.\n\"I have seen the video, and it was inappropriate.\"\n\nBrown said they will follow their proceedures which includes and internal\naffairs investigation as well as a review by the civilian review board who\nwill then provide a recommendation to him.\n\n\"I want to say this is not what I would expect from Salt Lake City PD,\" said\nBrown. \"My expectations are that if people are excercising their first\nammendment rights, we give them the space to do so peacefully.\"\n\nBrown said he has spoken to the man seen in the video to express his concern\nfor his well being and to apologize to him directly.\n\n\"It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for\nhim to experience it,\" said Brown.\n\nBrown additionally stated that \"overwhelmingly he saw exemplarly\nprofessionalism and thank all the officers for the hours upon hours of\nstanding in the sweltering heat in all their protective gear.\"\n\nBrown said he was relieved that under the reality of the situation that there\nwere no fatalities.\n\n\"My heart aches for the pain caused and insecure feelings that we have\nexperienced over the last 24 hours here in Salt Lake City,\" Said Brown. \"We\nunderstand that this insecure feeling pails in comparison to the overarching\noriginal reason for the protest.\"\n\nBrown said they reiterate their committment to stamping out systemic racism.\n\nYou can watch Chief Brown's statement here:",
