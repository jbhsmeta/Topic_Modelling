    "text": "Columbus: University of Toledo has issued the following news release:\n\nFormer Rocket track and cross country star Briana Shook is one of six new\nmembers inducted into the Mid-American Conference Hall of Fame.\n\nShook joins Stevi Large Gruber (Akron, women's track and field), Bryan\nBullington (Ball State, baseball), Margo Jonker (Central Michigan, softball),\nWally Szczerbiak (Miami, men's basketball) and Ellen Herman-Kimball (Ohio,\nvolleyball) in the 2020 induction class.\n\nShe said she is honored to be representing The University of Toledo in the MAC\nHall of Fame.\n\n\"It has been 15 years since I have raced, so getting the news of being\ninducted definitely took me back to the line, waiting for the gun,\" Shook\nsaid. \"Back then, I never thought there would be a time when running wasn't my\nlife. Today I try to teach my kids that hard work pays off and that the\nmemories are worth living wholeheartedly at the time that you are making them.\nI would go back in a heartbeat to race again.\n\n\"Everyone wishes they had a super power; every time I raced, I felt like I\nfound mine. I am so honored for the nomination and proud to be a Toledo Rocket\nalum.\"\n\nMAC Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher praised this year's induction class.\n\n\"We have such a storied history within our conference, and it is important to\nhonor and celebrate the accomplishments of our former students, coaches and\nadministrators, specifically these six individuals, and their achievements\nduring their time competing in the Mid-American Conference,\" Steinbrecher\nsaid. \"We are honored to welcome this year's class to the Mid-American\nConference Hall of Fame.\"\n\nShook is one of the most decorated student-athletes on the track in Toledo and\nMAC history. She was a three-time All-American in both cross country and track\nand field. Over the course of her career, Shook (2000 to 2004) won 11 MAC\ntitles and added three runner-up finishes, as well.\n\nShook helped lead the Rockets to back-to-back MAC Cross Country Championships\nin 2001 and 2002, winning the individual race both seasons. In 2002, she was\nnamed the NCAA Great Lakes Region Cross Country Runner of the Year. Shook was\na three-time MAC champion in the indoor 3,000, and twice each in the indoor\n5,000, the outdoor 5,000 and the 3,000-meter steeplechase. She still holds the\nMAC record in the indoor 3,000 meters (9:25.91) and the steeplechase\n(9:49.44).\n\nAt the 2002 MAC Outdoor Championship Meet, Shook earned the Most Valuable\nPerformance award for her victory in the steeplechase and 5,000 meters. She\nwent on to finish in fifth place in the steeplechase at the NCAA Championship\nMeet that year. Shook also earned Most Valuable Performance honors at the 2003\nMAC Indoor Championship Meet for her first-place finishes in the 3,000 and\n5,000 meters.\n\nIn 2004, she was named the MAC Outdoor Championship Meet Most Valuable\nPerformer and was named NCAA Mideast Track and Field Athlete of the Year. She\nwon the steeplechase (9:59.22) and the 5,000 meters (16:22.46) at the 2004 MAC\nMeet and finished second at the NCAA Championship Meet in the steeplechase.\n\nDuring the summer of 2004, Shook made history by setting the American record\nin the 3,000-meter steeplechase with her 9:29.32 clocking in Belgium, a time\nthat was fourth best in the world that year. She was ranked No. 1 in the U.S.\nin the steeplechase by Track & Field News in both 2003 and 2004, winning the\nUSA Outdoor title in 2003. In 2004, she won the U.S. Olympic Trials, but was\ndisqualified for missing a jump, even though she actually ended up running a\nlonger race than her competitors.\n\nShook graduated from Toledo in 2004 with a degree in communications and\nphotography, earning Academic All-MAC honors as a senior. She went on to join\nthe Toledo coaching staff, serving as an assistant from 2004 to 2008. Shook\nwas instrumental in helping to guide the women's cross country program to a\nMAC runner-up finish in 2005 and an eighth-place finish at the 2006 NCAA\nRegional Championships, the highest of any MAC program that season. She also\nhelped to guide Ebba Stenback to an eighth-place finish and All!-America\nstatus at the 2006 NCAA Championships in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Under\nShook's guidance, Stenback also was the NCAA Mideast Regional Champion and No.\n2 all-time steeplechaser in MAC history behind Shook.\n\nShook later served as head women's track and cross country coach at Heidelberg\nUniversity from 2010 to 2013. She coached 13 All-Americans, two national\nchampions, and was named Ohio Athletic Conference Women's Track and Field\nCoach of the Year in 2010 and 2013\\. She retired from coaching in 2013 to help\nraise her three children with her husband.\n\nShook was inducted into The University of Toledo Varsity T Hall of Fame in\n2010 and the Ohio Track and Cross Country Hall of Fame in 2020. She resides in\nMexico, Mo., with her husband, Robert, and the couple have three daughters --\nHaleigh (13), Atley (7) and Georgia (5).\n\nThe MAC Hall of Fame was approved by the MAC Council of Presidents in 1987.\nThe charter class was inducted in 1988 and subsequent classes were added in\n1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994. After six induction classes, the MAC Hall of\nFame maintained 52 members until it was reinstated in May 2012. This year's\nclass brings the number of MAC Hall of Fame inductees to 102 individuals from\n15 classes.",
