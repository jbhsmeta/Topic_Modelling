    "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. \\- As the Capital Region slowly reopens, businesses and schools\nare attempting to adapt.\n\nDuring Albany County Executive Dan McCoy's daily COVID-19 press brief Friday\nmorning, North Colonie Central School District Superintendent Joseph Corr and\nMcGeary's Irish Pub owner Tess Collins discussed how they're attempting to\nadapt to a different normal.\n\nCorr detailed how Shaker High School will proceed with its drive-thru\ngraduation ceremonies on June 27 at 10 a.m.\n\n\"Our students and our families will be in their cars. We are following the\nprotocols that have been specified by the New York State Department of\nHealth,\" Corr said.\n\n\"We will maintain social distancing. There will be one car per student with\nimmediate family members in the car. Students will proceed through a route\nstarting at our junior high school and going around a semi-circle that takes\nus through the high school parking lot,\" Corr continued on the route.\n\n\"They will be crossing a stage, there will be a photo opportunity for students\nand then students will exit out the main entrance at Shaker High School,\" Corr\nremarked on the students at least being able to return to campus for one last\nhurrah.\n\n\"As we continue to adapt as a society in response to COVID-19, sadly we're\nalso forced to change the way we conduct graduation ceremonies. A student's\ngraduation is a pivotal and memorable moment in their lives that is cherished\nfor a lifetime. While it's not ideal, I'm happy action was taken soon enough\nto at least provide a safe alternative for local youth,\" McCoy added.\n\nOn the business front, Collins addressed some of the challenges the bar and\nrestaurant community has encountered with constantly changing policies from\nthe state.\n\n\"The good thing is through this whole this thing, the restaurant people have\nbecome closer, which hasn't been in Albany in a long time. We meet, talk and\nwe get together and we've been having meetings,\" Collins said.\n\n\"What a lot of the political people don't understand and the public doesn't\nunderstand is things are changing for us all the time, we're constantly\ngetting updates on what we can do,\" Collins continued.\n\n\"A lot of us are just scared of doing the wrong thing. We want to be safe, we\ndon't know what to do, things are changing. If it's changing for the public,\nyou can imagine what is happening for us,\" Collins added, urging eager patrons\nto be patient with them as they try to adapt.\n\n\"Restaurants are caught in the middle of protecting their staff and customer\nbase and their own razor-thin profit margins. Today was important to hear\ndirectly from a local business owner who is a part of the fabric of our\ncommunity to better understand what people like her are going through and how\nthey're adapting,\" McCoy echoed on the balancing act.\n\nMcCoy also announced another COVID-19 linked death in the county and detailed\nhow the county is faring on the testing front.\n\nA man in his 70's died, bringing the county death toll to 113, according to\nMcCoy.\n\nAs of Friday morning, there have been 1,778 confirmed positive cases of\nCOVID-19 in Albany County, an increase of 18 from Thursday. Additionally,\nthere are 672 people under mandatory quarantine and three people under\nprecautionary quarantine.\n\nThus far, 4,785 people have completed quarantine, with 1,416 of them having\ntested positive and recovered.\n\nThere were three new hospitalizations since Thursday, and there are 15 people\nhospitalized in total with three in the ICU.\n\nMcCoy also highlighted the high turnout at yesterday's walk-up COVID-19\ntesting site that was made available to first responders and those who\nattended rallies and protests over the last several days and believe they may\nhave been exposed to COVID-19.\n\nA total of 78 people were tested in just one day. The county executive noted\nthe site will offer appointment free-testing next Wednesday, June 10, from 9\na.m. to 11 a.m. at the Capital South Campus, 20 Warren Street, in Albany.\nThose interested are asked to bring an ID and insurance (if you have it). If\nyou don't have insurance, it is free.\n\nMcCoy also reminded the public that as downtown continues to reopen in Phase\n2, metered and time-limited parking restrictions will be enforced once again\nstarting on Monday, June 8 at 8 a.m. after an announcement by Albany Mayor\nKathy Sheehan.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">ALBANY, N.Y.</location> - As the <location>Capital Region</location> slowly reopens, businesses and schools are attempting to adapt.</p>\n<p>During <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany County</location> Executive <person>Dan McCoy's</person> daily COVID-19 press brief Friday morning, North Colonie Central School District Superintendent <person>Joseph Corr</person> and <location>McGeary's Irish Pub</location> owner <person>Tess Collins</person> discussed how they're attempting to adapt to a different normal.</p>\n\n<p>Corr detailed how <org>Shaker High School</org> will proceed with its drive-thru graduation ceremonies on <chron>June 27</chron> at <chron>10 a.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>\"Our students and our families will be in their cars. We are following the protocols that have been specified by the <org>New York State Department of Health</org>,\" Corr said.</p>\n\n<p>\"We will maintain social distancing. There will be one car per student with immediate family members in the car. Students will proceed through a route starting at our junior high school and going around a semi-circle that takes us through the high school parking lot,\" Corr continued on the route.</p>\n\n<p>\"They will be crossing a stage, there will be a photo opportunity for students and then students will exit out the main entrance at <org>Shaker High School</org>,\" Corr remarked on the students at least being able to return to campus for one last hurrah.</p>\n\n<p>\"As we continue to adapt as a society in response to COVID-19, sadly we're also forced to change the way we conduct graduation ceremonies. A student's graduation is a pivotal and memorable moment in their lives that is cherished for a lifetime. While it's not ideal, I'm happy action was taken soon enough to at least provide a safe alternative for local youth,\" McCoy added.</p>\n\n<p>On the business front, Collins addressed some of the challenges the bar and restaurant community has encountered with constantly changing policies from the state.</p>\n\n<p>\"The good thing is through this whole this thing, the restaurant people have become closer, which hasn't been in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany</location> in a long time. We meet, talk and we get together and we've been having meetings,\" Collins said.</p>\n\n<p>\"What a lot of the political people don't understand and the public doesn't understand is things are changing for us all the time, we're constantly getting updates on what we can do,\" Collins continued.</p>\n\n<p>\"A lot of us are just scared of doing the wrong thing. We want to be safe, we don't know what to do, things are changing. If it's changing for the public, you can imagine what is happening for us,\" Collins added, urging eager patrons to be patient with them as they try to adapt.</p>\n\n<p>\"Restaurants are caught in the middle of protecting their staff and customer base and their own razor-thin profit margins. Today was important to hear directly from a local business owner who is a part of the fabric of our community to better understand what people like her are going through and how they're adapting,\" McCoy echoed on the balancing act.</p>\n\n<p>McCoy also announced another COVID-19 linked death in the county and detailed how the county is faring on the testing front.</p>\n\n<p>A man in his 70's died, bringing the county death toll to 113, according to McCoy.</p>\n\n<p>As of Friday morning, there have been 1,778 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany County</location>, an increase of 18 from Thursday. Additionally, there are 672 people under mandatory quarantine and three people under precautionary quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>Thus far, 4,785 people have completed quarantine, with 1,416 of them having tested positive and recovered.</p>\n\n<p>There were three new hospitalizations since Thursday, and there are 15 people hospitalized in total with three in the ICU.</p>\n\n<p>McCoy also highlighted the high turnout at yesterday's walk-up COVID-19 testing site that was made available to first responders and those who attended rallies and protests over the last several days and believe they may have been exposed to COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>A total of 78 people were tested in just one day. The county executive noted the site will offer appointment free-testing next <chron>Wednesday, June 10</chron>, from <chron>9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</chron> at the Capital South Campus, <location>20 Warren Street</location>, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany</location>. Those interested are asked to bring an ID and insurance (if you have it). If you don't have insurance, it is free.</p>\n\n<p>McCoy also reminded the public that as downtown continues to reopen in Phase 2, metered and time-limited parking restrictions will be enforced once again starting on <chron>Monday, June 8</chron> at <chron>8 a.m.</chron> after an announcement by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany</location> Mayor <person>Kathy Sheehan</person>.</p>",
