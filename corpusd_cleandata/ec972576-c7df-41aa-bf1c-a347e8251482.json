    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Hospital &\nNursing Home Daily \\-- Investigators publish new report on endocrinology.\nAccording to news reporting out of Chengdu, People's Republic of China, by\nNewsRx editors, research stated, \"Cardiovascular diseases have become the\nleading cause of human death. Aging is an independent risk factor for\ncardiovascular diseases.\"\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from West China Second\nUniversity Hospital: \"Cardiac aging is associated with maladaptation of\ncellular metabolism, dysfunction (or senescence) of cardiomyocytes, a decrease\nin angiogenesis, and an increase in tissue scarring (fibrosis). These events\neventually lead to cardiac remodeling and failure. Senescent cardiomyocytes\nshow the hallmarks of DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondria\ndysfunction, contractile dysfunction, hypertrophic growth, and senescence-\nassociated secreting phenotype (SASP). Metabolism within cardiomyocytes is\nessential not only to fuel the pump function of the heart but also to maintain\nthe functional homeostasis and participate in the senescence of\ncardiomyocytes. The senescence of cardiomyocyte is also regulated by the non-\nmyocytes (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells) in the local\nmicroenvironment. On the other hand, the senescent cardiomyocytes alter their\nphenotypes and subsequently affect the non-myocytes in the local\nmicroenvironment and contribute to cardiac aging and pathological remodeling.\nIn this review, we first summarized the hallmarks of the senescence of\ncardiomyocytes. Then, we discussed the metabolic switch within senescent\ncardiomyocytes and provided a discussion of the cellular communications\nbetween dysfunctional cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes in the local\nmicroenvironment.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We also addressed the\nfunctions of metabolic regulators within non-myocytes in modulating myocardial\nmicroenvironment. Finally, we pointed out some interesting and important\nquestions that are needed to be addressed by further studies.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Cardiomyocyte Senescence and\nCellular Communications Within Myocardial Microenvironments. _Frontiers in\nEndocrinology_ , 2020,11.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Hospital &amp; Nursing Home Daily</org> -- Investigators publish new report on endocrinology. According to news reporting out of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..chengd\">Chengdu</location>, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx editors, research stated, &#8220;Cardiovascular diseases have become the leading cause of human death. Aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from <org>West China Second University Hospital</org>: &#8220;Cardiac aging is associated with maladaptation of cellular metabolism, dysfunction (or senescence) of cardiomyocytes, a decrease in angiogenesis, and an increase in tissue scarring (fibrosis). These events eventually lead to cardiac remodeling and failure. Senescent cardiomyocytes show the hallmarks of DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondria dysfunction, contractile dysfunction, hypertrophic growth, and senescence-associated secreting phenotype (SASP). Metabolism within cardiomyocytes is essential not only to fuel the pump function of the heart but also to maintain the functional homeostasis and participate in the senescence of cardiomyocytes. The senescence of cardiomyocyte is also regulated by the non-myocytes (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells) in the local microenvironment. On the other hand, the senescent cardiomyocytes alter their phenotypes and subsequently affect the non-myocytes in the local microenvironment and contribute to cardiac aging and pathological remodeling. In this review, we first summarized the hallmarks of the senescence of cardiomyocytes. Then, we discussed the metabolic switch within senescent cardiomyocytes and provided a discussion of the cellular communications between dysfunctional cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes in the local microenvironment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;We also addressed the functions of metabolic regulators within non-myocytes in modulating myocardial microenvironment. Finally, we pointed out some interesting and important questions that are needed to be addressed by further studies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Cardiomyocyte Senescence and Cellular Communications Within Myocardial Microenvironments. <em>Frontiers in Endocrinology</em>, 2020,11.
