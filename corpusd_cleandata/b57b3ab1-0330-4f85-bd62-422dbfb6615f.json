His story is not unique. Countless\nothers have also experienced this use of excessive police force while trying\nto have their voices heard,\" Murphy tweeted.\n\nHe added, \"Luckily, his eye was saved due to a kind stranger that was handing\nout goggles to protestors shortly before the shooting and another kind\nstranger that drove him to the ER. Others were not so lucky and will be\npermanently disabled due to excessive police force.\"\n\n\"As terrible as this experience has been, we know that it's practically\nnothing compared to the systemic racism and violence against Black life that\nhe was protesting in the first place,\" Murphy tweeted. \"Black communities\nacross America have been terrorized for centuries by excessive police force.\"\n\nRELATED: For fourth night, Denver police unleash tear gas and foam bullets as\nmarchers again defy curfew\n\nMurphy played 18 years in the major leagues and spent his final season with\nthe Rockies in their inaugural season in 1993.",

    "html": "<p>Two-time National <org>League MVP</org> and former Rockies outfielder <person>Dale Murphy</person> said on Twitter Sunday that one of his sons was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet during Saturday's protest in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location> against violence by law enforcement and rally for justice in the name of <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n<p>\"Last night, my son was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet while peacefully protesting for justice for <person>George Floyd</person>. His story is not unique. Countless others have also experienced this use of excessive police force while trying to have their voices heard,\" Murphy tweeted.</p>\n\n<p>He added, \"Luckily, his eye was saved due to a kind stranger that was handing out goggles to protestors shortly before the shooting and another kind stranger that drove him to the ER. Others were not so lucky and will be permanently disabled due to excessive police force.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"As terrible as this experience has been, we know that it's practically nothing compared to the systemic racism and violence against Black life that he was protesting in the first place,\" Murphy tweeted. \"Black communities across America have been terrorized for centuries by excessive police force.\"</p>\n\n<p>RELATED: For fourth night, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location> police unleash tear gas and foam bullets as marchers again defy curfew</p>\n\n<p>Murphy played 18 years in the major leagues and spent his final season with the Rockies in their inaugural season in 1993.</p>",
