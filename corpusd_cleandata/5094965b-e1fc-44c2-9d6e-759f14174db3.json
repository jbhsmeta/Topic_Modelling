    "text": "Dagmar Belakowitsch (FPO) complained that the Federal Council's decision to\nprotect workers who live in the same household with corona risk subjects was\npostponed in the Social Committee. This goes past the interests of those\naffected, said the social spokeswoman for the freedom. She also called for an\nincrease in unemployment benefits if the crisis caused people to lose their\njobs through no fault of their own. Your group colleague Peter Wurm sees long-\nterm pensions at risk from the Corona crisis and once again brought the\nAustria 1000s into the discussion for the general public to stimulate the\neconomy. With an application, he asked the government to ensure the\nimplementation of Section 10 of the Social Welfare Policy Act in the federal\nstates.\n\nPeter Schmiedlechner (FPO), in turn, devoted himself to agriculture as a\nsystemically relevant area. \"The farmers can deliver, but they don't earn\nanything,\" he added critically. They were fed with an insufficient package. He\ntherefore tabled a resolution in which the FP called for social security\ncontributions to be waived for small and medium-sized farms for the 2020\nmarketing year.\n\nChristian Ries (FPO) railed against price inflation in times of crisis. They\ntook advantage of the predicament of the people and raised the prices for\nmasks, hand disinfectants, but also food. He accused the minister of not\ntaking action and called for price monitoring through a motion for a\nresolution.\n\nHe also criticized the so-called \"Stop Corona App\". This does not help\nanywhere near what it promises, and there is too little information. Ries also\nspoke out against a mandatory app. \"There will be no compulsory app, Minister\nAnschober subsequently assured that it would be voluntary. At the moment it is\nbeing optimized by the Red Cross,\" he said, and promised better information\nabout it.",

    "html": "<p>Dagmar Belakowitsch (FPO) complained that the <org>Federal Council's</org> decision to protect workers who live in the same household with corona risk subjects was postponed in the Social Committee. This goes past the interests of those affected, said the social spokeswoman for the freedom. She also called for an increase in unemployment benefits if the crisis caused people to lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Your group colleague <person>Peter Wurm</person> sees long-term pensions at risk from the Corona crisis and once again brought the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/at\">Austria</location> 1000s into the discussion for the general public to stimulate the economy. With an application, he asked the government to ensure the implementation of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.al.secion\">Section</location> 10 of the Social Welfare Policy Act in the federal states.</p>\n<p>Peter Schmiedlechner (FPO), in turn, devoted himself to agriculture as a systemically relevant area. \"The farmers can deliver, but they don't earn anything,\" he added critically. They were fed with an insufficient package. He therefore tabled a resolution in which the FP called for social security contributions to be waived for small and medium-sized farms for the 2020 marketing year.</p>\n<p><person>Christian Ries</person> (FPO) railed against price inflation in times of crisis. They took advantage of the predicament of the people and raised the prices for masks, hand disinfectants, but also food. He accused the minister of not taking action and called for price monitoring through a motion for a resolution.</p>\n<p>He also criticized the so-called \"Stop Corona App\". This does not help anywhere near what it promises, and there is too little information. Ries also spoke out against a mandatory app. \"There will be no compulsory app, Minister Anschober subsequently assured that it would be voluntary. At the moment it is being optimized by the <org>Red Cross</org>,\" he said, and promised better information about it.</p>",
