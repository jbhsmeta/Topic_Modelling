    "text": "Jun. 4\\--GALESBURG \\-- Court is back in session, although not everyone has\ngotten the memo.\n\nThe Illinois Supreme Court announced May 20 that circuit courts would be\nallowed to resume regular operations June 1, but how courts would handle this\naction was not specified, aside from that they should follow social distancing\nmeasures and find a way to reduce the number of people present in courtrooms\nand courthouses.\n\nAt the Knox County Courthouse, Zoom meetings are now often replacing\ntraditional in-person court, and a YouTube stream is taking the place of an\nin-court audience, for those who choose those options. Still, with a large\nnumber of cases delayed over the past few months, many people are either not\naware or forgetting to show up.\n\n\"About half the people are just not showing up to court,\" Administrative\nJustice Scott Shipplett said.\n\nWhile cases deemed essential were still heard since shutdowns in March brought\ncourtroom proceedings to a near halt, June 1 opened the floodgates for cases\nthat have built up over time.\n\nOrders of protection, bail hearings and drug cases were still heard, but many\nwere not.\n\n\"If there was a case where somebody was behind on their credit card bill and\nthe credit card company wanted to sue them, they just had to wait,\" Shipplett\nsaid.\n\nWhat court looks like will differ from the traditional appearance of a court\nhearing, if not the format. When Shipplett presides over felony cases, he will\nbe in his office, and the court reporter will be in hers. The state's attorney\nwill also be tuning in virtually, while public defenders will be in their\noffice, sometimes with their clients, or in the hall, where laptop computers\nin the witness room can be used to join the meeting.\n\nCircuit Judge Emily Sutton is operating traffic and misdemeanor courts, which\nalso resumed for the first time in months on June 1, with a mixture of in-\nperson and Zoom calls. Like Shipplett's courtroom, she has also had issues\nwith individuals missing their hearings.\n\n\"I don't think word has spread that we are back in business, and I think some\nof that has to do with the confusion that may be out there because there is no\none size fits all approach,\" she said of the state's method to reopen courts.\n\nFor Monday, Wednesday and Friday traffic and misdemeanor court, different\noptions are being allowed for those coming in. Those who come to the courtroom\non their date are given the option to return to their cars or even their homes\nand dial into court remotely with audio only or audio and video on Zoom.\n\nFor those who don't have the technology, or perhaps are not comfortable with\ncalling into court, a limited number will be allowed into the courtroom\nitself, limited to eight at a time. These individuals are given numbers and\ncalled in over time.\n\nThose who do choose to appear in the courtroom must wear masks, and some\nchairs have been taped off so that everyone sits at least six feet apart. Pens\nare disinfected between uses.\n\nWith gatherings in enclosed spaces still encouraged to stay under 10 people,\ncourtrooms have had to get creative to work within the restrictions. Shipplett\nsays jury trials will be a great challenge, as jury pools contain 60 to 70\npeople, and the courthouse is not large enough to space out people of that\nvolume.\n\nShipplett says he was told by Knox County Health Department Director Michele\nGabriel that in mid-June, if Illinois moves on to the next phase of its\nrecovery plan, they may be able to make accommodations in the courthouse and\nreturn to live courtroom hearings. Even then, the judge does not mind the way\ncourt is being done for now.\n\n\"I like doing it by Zoom,\" he said. \"It's different, but nobody's getting sick\nthis way.\"\n\n___\n\n(c)2020 The Register-Mail, Galesburg, Ill\n\nVisit The Register-Mail, Galesburg, Ill at www.galesburg.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Courts back in session, but no-shows abound [The Register-Mail, Galesburg, Ill.]",
    "html": "<p><chron>Jun. 4</chron>--<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.galurg\">GALESBURG</location> -- Court is back in session, although not everyone has gotten the memo.</p>\n<p><org>The Illinois Supreme Court</org> announced <chron>May 20</chron> that circuit courts would be allowed to resume regular operations <chron>June 1</chron>, but how courts would handle this action was not specified, aside from that they should follow social distancing measures and find a way to reduce the number of people present in courtrooms and courthouses.</p>\n<p>At the <location>Knox County Courthouse</location>, Zoom meetings are now often replacing traditional in-person court, and a YouTube stream is taking the place of an in-court audience, for those who choose those options. Still, with a large number of cases delayed over the past few months, many people are either not aware or forgetting to show up.</p>\n<p>\"About half the people are just not showing up to court,\" Administrative Justice <person>Scott Shipplett</person> said.</p>\n<p>While cases deemed essential were still heard since shutdowns in March brought courtroom proceedings to a near halt, <chron>June 1</chron> opened the floodgates for cases that have built up over time.</p>\n<p>Orders of protection, bail hearings and drug cases were still heard, but many were not.</p>\n<p>\"If there was a case where somebody was behind on their credit card bill and the credit card company wanted to sue them, they just had to wait,\" Shipplett said.</p>\n<p>What court looks like will differ from the traditional appearance of a court hearing, if not the format. When Shipplett presides over felony cases, he will be in his office, and the court reporter will be in hers. The state's attorney will also be tuning in virtually, while public defenders will be in their office, sometimes with their clients, or in the hall, where laptop computers in the witness room can be used to join the meeting.</p>\n<p>Circuit Judge <person>Emily Sutton</person> is operating traffic and misdemeanor courts, which also resumed for the first time in months on <chron>June 1</chron>, with a mixture of in-person and Zoom calls. Like Shipplett's courtroom, she has also had issues with individuals missing their hearings.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think word has spread that we are back in business, and I think some of that has to do with the confusion that may be out there because there is no one size fits all approach,\" she said of the state's method to reopen courts.</p>\n<p>For Monday, Wednesday and Friday traffic and misdemeanor court, different options are being allowed for those coming in. Those who come to the courtroom on their date are given the option to return to their cars or even their homes and dial into court remotely with audio only or audio and video on Zoom.</p>\n<p>For those who don't have the technology, or perhaps are not comfortable with calling into court, a limited number will be allowed into the courtroom itself, limited to eight at a time. These individuals are given numbers and called in over time.</p>\n<p>Those who do choose to appear in the courtroom must wear masks, and some chairs have been taped off so that everyone sits at least six feet apart. Pens are disinfected between uses.</p>\n<p>With gatherings in enclosed spaces still encouraged to stay under 10 people, courtrooms have had to get creative to work within the restrictions. Shipplett says jury trials will be a great challenge, as jury pools contain 60 to 70 people, and the courthouse is not large enough to space out people of that volume.</p>\n<p>Shipplett says he was told by <org>Knox County Health Department</org> Director <person>Michele Gabriel</person> that in mid-June, if <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.il\">Illinois</location> moves on to the next phase of its recovery plan, they may be able to make accommodations in the courthouse and return to live courtroom hearings. Even then, the judge does not mind the way court is being done for now.</p>\n<p>\"I like doing it by Zoom,\" he said. \"It's different, but nobody's getting sick this way.\"</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">___</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">(c)2020 The Register-Mail, Galesburg, Ill</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">Visit The Register-Mail, Galesburg, Ill at www.galesburg.com</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>",
