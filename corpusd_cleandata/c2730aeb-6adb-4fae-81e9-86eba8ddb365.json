Carwile said between Lee's\npreliminary hearing and trial date he was struck by a vehicle while crossing a\nstreet in Lynchburg and suffered injury.\n\nCarwile said Lee effectively is on probation the rest of his life with 60\nyears of possible prison time hanging over him if he reoffends.\n\n\"The plea agreement was constructed in consideration of the current COVID-19\ncrisis and in consideration of the extensive health issue that the defendant\nsuffers,\" Carwile said following the May 11 hearing.",
