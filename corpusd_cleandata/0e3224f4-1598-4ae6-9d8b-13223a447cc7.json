    "text": "Doctors, scientists, politicians and perhaps even your next door neighbor are\nnow proving to you that they have a handle on the truth and know what they are\ntalking about because, are you ready for this, they deal with \"data\". They\ntherefore have a lock on true wisdom and so insist that not to believe what\nthey have concluded would be foolhardy at best.\n\nAnybody who offers as the only proof of the validity of what she/he says is\nthe fact that it is based on data should immediately be suspect.\n\nSo, what is this mysterious data that holds all the secrets and answers? A\ndatum (data is plural) is simply a piece of information. The first question in\ncollecting or finding data on which to base a conclusion is \"What data exactly\nare you looking at?\" Is it the correct or most appropriate data?\n\nFor example, in trying to predict future auto sales, one might conclude that\nthey are going to trend down because of the huge numbers of cars on the roads\nand so people don't need more cars.\n\nAnd we know this to be true because we counted the cars (i.e. collected data\npoints). However, if we had also noted the age of all these cars and saw many\nolder ones, it might be better to predict that sales will be going up, not\ndown. What data you collect does matter.\n\nWe also have to remember that data is collected and reported by human beings.\nOne time I along with six others was in a building that blew up around us as\nwe were attempting to make a quantity of a new experimental chemical.\n\nIn the investigation that followed, it was discovered that the research\nchemist who provided the information (i.e. data) to us that was needed to make\nthe new chemical chose not to include certain information that he felt was\nirrelevant and of course, it was the information that if known to us would\nhave prevented the rather dramatic explosion.\n\nData is always open to some interpretation and human error will always be\nlurking around the corner. That is the reason why we see such different\nresults from \"models.\"\n\nA model is simply a calculation of what might result when new information is\nadded to a previously developed equation which is based on data that is deemed\nrelevant by human beings.\n\nThat is why every hurricane season when we try to predict where a hurricane\nwill hit the mainland there are many models and the results end up stretching\nfrom Florida to Virginia. And that doesn't even count a wild card like a\nKatrina, which totally fooled all the models as it decided to take a last-\nminute turn and head straight into New Orleans.\n\nIf you have the opportunity whenever someone is talking about \"data driven\"\nconclusions, before you accept what is being said, ask: \"What data exactly has\nbeen used? What has been left out (and why)?\" since the phrase is being used\nby many shallow \"experts\" just to place an imprimatur of authenticity on the\nactions that they are taking.\n\nIt is similar to the current trend to declare that the speaker's actions are\nbased on \"science\" another buzzword that if questioned labels you as a\n\"denier.\" It is a cheap debating tactic meant to win the argument rather than\nadd meaningful knowledge to the conversation.\n\nAs was often heard in my research engineering days: \"We can torture the data\nand get it to confess anything we want.\"\n\nDick Sakulich is a retired manufacturing executive.

    "html": "<p>Doctors, scientists, politicians and perhaps even your next door neighbor are now proving to you that they have a handle on the truth and know what they are talking about because, are you ready for this, they deal with \"data\". They therefore have a lock on true wisdom and so insist that not to believe what they have concluded would be foolhardy at best.</p>\n<p>Anybody who offers as the only proof of the validity of what she/he says is the fact that it is based on data should immediately be suspect.</p>\n\n<p>So, what is this mysterious data that holds all the secrets and answers? A datum (data is plural) is simply a piece of information. The first question in collecting or finding data on which to base a conclusion is \"What data exactly are you looking at?\" Is it the correct or most appropriate data?</p>\n\n<p>For example, in trying to predict future auto sales, one might conclude that they are going to trend down because of the huge numbers of cars on the roads and so people don't need more cars.</p>\n\n<p>And we know this to be true because we counted the cars (i.e. collected data points). However, if we had also noted the age of all these cars and saw many older ones, it might be better to predict that sales will be going up, not down. What data you collect does matter.</p>\n\n<p>We also have to remember that data is collected and reported by human beings. One time I along with six others was in a building that blew up around us as we were attempting to make a quantity of a new experimental chemical.</p>\n\n<p>In the investigation that followed, it was discovered that the research chemist who provided the information (i.e. data) to us that was needed to make the new chemical chose not to include certain information that he felt was irrelevant and of course, it was the information that if known to us would have prevented the rather dramatic explosion.</p>\n\n<p>Data is always open to some interpretation and human error will always be lurking around the corner. That is the reason why we see such different results from \"models.\"</p>\n\n<p>A model is simply a calculation of what might result when new information is added to a previously developed equation which is based on data that is deemed relevant by human beings.</p>\n\n<p>That is why every hurricane season when we try to predict where a hurricane will hit the mainland there are many models and the results end up stretching from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>. And that doesn't even count a wild card like a Katrina, which totally fooled all the models as it decided to take a last-minute turn and head straight into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location>.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the opportunity whenever someone is talking about \"data driven\" conclusions, before you accept what is being said, ask: \"What data exactly has been used? What has been left out (and why)?\" since the phrase is being used by many shallow \"experts\" just to place an imprimatur of authenticity on the actions that they are taking.</p>\n\n<p>It is similar to the current trend to declare that the speaker's actions are based on \"science\" another buzzword that if questioned labels you as a \"denier.\" It is a cheap debating tactic meant to win the argument rather than add meaningful knowledge to the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>As was often heard in my research engineering days: \"We can torture the data and get it to confess anything we want.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Dick Sakulich</person> is a retired manufacturing executive.
