    "text": "Copyright (C) 2020 Albuquerque Journal\n\nWith a pandemic forcing many people to work from home, some Albuquerque\nofficials are wondering if that is a logical place for some in the city's\nworkforce to stay long term.\n\nThe Albuquerque City Council last week asked for a cost-benefit analysis of a\ntelecommuting model for city employees in jobs that do not face the public.\n\nCouncilor Klarissa Pe\u00f1a, who co-sponsored the legislation with Lan Sena, said\nit is worth considering, based on the feedback she said she has heard recently\nfrom city employees who are temporarily working from home due to coronavirus.\n\n\"Folks are saying they feel it's been pretty productive,\" she said in an\ninterview. \"They feel they're able to get more things done.\"\n\nThe duo's resolution cleared City Council on a unanimous vote Monday. It calls\non the city's Office of Management and Budget to evaluate partial and complete\nteleworking models for the city, taking into account which positions are\nsuitable, as well as any possible savings and costs associated with a more\nremote workforce.\n\nThe analysis, which would be due Aug. 1, will also explore the \"potential for\nconversion\" of some full-time positions to part-time based on efficiencies,\nsomething Councilor Brook Bassan questioned before ultimately voting for the\nanalysis.\n\n\"It's a little challenging to think about doing more job cuts,\" she said\nbefore the vote.\n\nThe analysis should be available as the city is completing its fiscal year\n2021 budget, and sponsors stressed that it was merely a way to bring more\ninformation to the table.\n\n\"It is just a study to analyze the current situation and what we could be\ndoing in terms of savings \u0096 just a better scope  and tool to make these\nimportant decisions,\" Sena said during the meeting.\n\nSarita Nair, the city's chief administrative officer, noted Monday that only a\nsmall portion \u0096 about 10% \u0096 of the city's roughly 6,000-person workforce is\nactually telecommuting, even now. Many, such as code inspectors and parks\nmaintenance workers, work in a \"remote dispatch\" setup.\n\nBut Nair said she supported the idea of a telecommuting analysis, particularly\nbecause Bernalillo County employees are slated to leave the shared city-county\nbuilding next year in favor of new county headquarters.\n\n\"It's a good time to think about reallocation of space,\" Nair said.",

    "html": "<p>Copyright &#169; 2020 Albuquerque Journal</p>\n<p>With a pandemic forcing many people to work from home, some Albuquerque officials are wondering if that is a logical place for some in the city's workforce to stay long term.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Albuquerque City Council</org> last week asked for a cost-benefit analysis of a telecommuting model for city employees in jobs that do not face the public.</p>\n\n<p>Councilor <person>Klarissa Pe&#241;a</person>, who co-sponsored the legislation with <person>Lan Sena</person>, said it is worth considering, based on the feedback she said she has heard recently from city employees who are temporarily working from home due to coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>\"Folks are saying they feel it's been pretty productive,\" she said in an interview. \"They feel they're able to get more things done.\"</p>\n\n<p>The duo's resolution cleared <org>City Council</org> on a unanimous vote Monday. It calls on the city's <org>Office of Management and Budget</org> to evaluate partial and complete teleworking models for the city, taking into account which positions are suitable, as well as any possible savings and costs associated with a more remote workforce.</p>\n\n<p>The analysis, which would be due <chron>Aug. 1</chron>, will also explore the \"potential for conversion\" of some full-time positions to part-time based on efficiencies, something Councilor <person>Brook Bassan</person> questioned before ultimately voting for the analysis.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's a little challenging to think about doing more job cuts,\" she said before the vote.</p>\n\n<p>The analysis should be available as the city is completing its fiscal year 2021 budget, and sponsors stressed that it was merely a way to bring more information to the table.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is just a study to analyze the current situation and what we could be doing in terms of savings &#150; just a better scope &#133; and tool to make these important decisions,\" Sena said during the meeting.</p>\n\n<p><person>Sarita Nair</person>, the city's chief administrative officer, noted Monday that only a small portion &#150; about 10% &#150; of the city's roughly 6,000-person workforce is actually telecommuting, even now. Many, such as code inspectors and parks maintenance workers, work in a \"remote dispatch\" setup.</p>\n\n<p>But Nair said she supported the idea of a telecommuting analysis, particularly because Bernalillo County employees are slated to leave the shared city-county building next year in favor of new county headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's a good time to think about reallocation of space,\" Nair said.</p>",
