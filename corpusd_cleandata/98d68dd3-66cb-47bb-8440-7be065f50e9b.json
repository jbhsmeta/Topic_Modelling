    "text": "Now that the State of Illinois has entered Phase 3 of the pandemic response,\nOrion is taking steps to reopen.\n\nOn Monday, June 1, Western District Library has opened the drive-up book drop\nin the alley. Patrons wishing to return books and DVDs should use the\nappropriate slot. All items have a due date of June 26.\n\nAnyone with items that may be damaged in the book drop should keep them until\nthe library is able to have patrons return them in person. These items include\nmagazines, puzzles and hot spots.\n\nCurbside pick-up will begin Wednesday, June 10. More details will be released\nlater.\n\nPatrons can visit <https://omnilibraries.overdrive.com/> to access e-books and\naudiobooks with their library cards. Anyone who lives in the area but does not\nhave a library card can use a mobile number to sign up to use the site.\n\nOverseeing the changes is the new library director, Michelle Bailey, whose\nfirst day was June 1.\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the Orion village board on Tuesday, May 26, Village\nPresident Jim Cooper said Orion would defer to Gov. J.B. Pritzker's\nrestrictions on the use of parks.\n\nTrustee Mike Dunlap, chairman of the parks committee, announced the partial\nreopening of Love and Central parks at the regular village board meeting on\nMonday, June 1.\n\nBasketball and tennis courts are open, but playground equipment, bathrooms and\ndrinking fountains are still closed, Dunlap said.\n\nThe village is allowing ball teams to practice with a maximum of 10 players\nand one adult coach and no spectators, he said.\n\nScrimmages will be allowed, but not competitive games, Cooper said. Coaches\nwill have to work out practice schedules themselves. Village Clerk Lori\nSampson will not schedule the use of diamonds.\n\nCooper said on May 26 that he had discussed opening village hall with Village\nClerk Lori Sampson, and they had decided there was no immediate need to open\nthe building to the public. He affirmed the decision on June 1.\n\nThe Village of Orion joined Andover, Cambridge, Geneseo, Kewanee, Galva,\nColona, Atkinson, Annawan and Woodhull to prepare a plan for reopening\nbusinesses during Phase 3. Also part of the planning were Hammond-Henry\nHospital, the Henry & Stark County Health Department and the Geneseo Chamber\nof Commerce.\n\nTo find the plan, \"Forward Together: Reopening & Recovery Toolkit for\nBusiness,\" visit\n[https:www.cityofgeneseo.com/covid-19-updates/](http://https:www.cityofgeneseo.com/covid-19-updates/).\n\nClick on \"Henry County Toolkit\" for the Phase 3 plan, and on \"Road to\nRecovery: Restore Henry County Municipalities\" for an overview of all five\nphases.\n\n\"Henry County Toolkit\" can be saved as a PDF and downloaded.",
