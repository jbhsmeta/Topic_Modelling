    "text": "Thabo Sefolosha knows what it's like to be a black man, on the ground,\nsurrounded by police officers.\n\nSuch was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week.\n\nAnd when Sefolosha watched that video, his memories came flooding back.\n\n\"I was just horrified by what I saw,\" Sefolosha said. \"That could have been\nme.\"\n\nTime has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was\nattacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while\nthey were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city's Chelsea\nneighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional\npain returned last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who\npleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer -\nsubsequently charged with murder - pressed a knee on his neck.\n\nSefolosha has not watched much news since. His experience with police in New\nYork has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst\nflooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers.\nAnd the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset.\n\n\"People talk about a few rotten apples,\" Sefolosha said in an interview with\nThe Associated Press. \"But you know, in my experience and from what we're\nseeing, I think it's deeper than that as a culture that's deeply rooted in it,\nto be honest. That's just my honest opinion. I think it's really  part of a\nculture where it's deeper than just a few bad apples.\"\n\nThe four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were\nfired; the one who knelt on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with\nthird-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have\nbroken out in several cities in recent days.\n\nSefolosha - a black man and Swiss citizen who plays for the Houston Rockets \\-\nconsidered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is\nwaiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March\nbecause of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I'm mad, for sure,\" Sefolosha said. \"That's for sure. I mean, it's 2020.\nNobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black\npeople have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much\nand done so much for this country. It's hurtful to see it this way.\"\n\nSefolosha's perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an\nNBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where\nSefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the\narea. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers\nanyway.\n\nBefore long, he was on the ground.\n\nSefolosha's leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he\nwas arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to\ndetermine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his\ncivil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money\nto a public defenders' organization working in marginalized communities.\n\n\"It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,\"\nSefolosha said. \"And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I\nwent to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got\nme deep into the system and I'm really skeptical of the whole system.\"\n\nNBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial\ninequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights\nlawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking\nincident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and\nJaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta\nprotests.\n\n\"You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are\nwatching another human being killing somebody,\" said Sefolosha, who has played\nin the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires.\n\"And instead of saying, 'OK, this is my duty as a human being,' the duty was\nmore toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, 'We are a clan,\nwe stick together no matter what.' It should be the other way around.\"\n\nThe NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the\nDisney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be\ncontenders for a championship when play resumes.\n\nFor obvious reasons, Sefolosha's mind isn't there yet.\n\n\"I'll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in\ngeneral,\" Sefolosha said. \"But you know, we're human beings, and the fight has\nbeen going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too\nlong. I think it's definitely time for change and that should be a priority\nfor all of us.\"",

    "title": "Floyd's death opens old wounds for Thabo Sefolosha",
    "html": "<p><person>Thabo Sefolosha</person> knows what it's like to be a black man, on the ground, surrounded by police officers.</p>\n<p>Such was the scenario when <person>George Floyd</person> died in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> last week.</p>\n\n<p>And when Sefolosha watched that video, his memories came flooding back.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was just horrified by what I saw,\" Sefolosha said. \"That could have been me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of <org>New York Police Department</org> officers in <chron>April 2015</chron> while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city's Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain returned last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer - subsequently charged with murder - pressed a knee on his neck.</p>\n\n<p>Sefolosha has not watched much news since. His experience with police in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location> has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset.</p>\n\n<p>\"People talk about a few rotten apples,\" Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"But you know, in my experience and from what we're seeing, I think it's deeper than that as a culture that's deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That's just my honest opinion. I think it's really &#133; part of a culture where it's deeper than just a few bad apples.\"</p>\n\n<p>The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd's neck, <person>Derek Chauvin</person>, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days.</p>\n\n<p>Sefolosha - a black man and Swiss citizen who plays for the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131373\">Houston Rockets</org> - considered but decided against joining protests in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">Atlanta</location>, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm mad, for sure,\" Sefolosha said. \"That's for sure. I mean, it's 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It's hurtful to see it this way.\"</p>\n\n<p>Sefolosha's perspective changed forever on <chron>April 8, 2015</chron>. <person>Chris Copeland</person>, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Before long, he was on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Sefolosha's leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for <money>$50 million</money>, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for <money>$4 million</money> and gave much of that money to a public defenders' organization working in marginalized communities.</p>\n\n<p>\"It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,\" Sefolosha said. \"And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I'm really skeptical of the whole system.\"</p>\n\n<p>NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. <person>Sterling Brown</person> of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131360\">Milwaukee Bucks</org> filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, <person>Malcolm Brogdon</person> of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131392\">Indiana Pacers</org> and <person>Jaylen Brown</person> of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131381\">Boston Celtics</org> were among those taking part in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">Atlanta</location> protests.</p>\n\n<p>\"You see what happened in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location> where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,\" said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ch\">Switzerland</location> when he retires. \"And instead of saying, 'OK, this is my duty as a human being,' the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, 'We are a clan, we stick together no matter what.' It should be the other way around.\"</p>\n\n<p>The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the <org>Disney</org> complex near <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando, Florida</location>. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes.</p>\n\n<p>For obvious reasons, Sefolosha's mind isn't there yet.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,\" Sefolosha said. \"But you know, we're human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it's definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.\"</p>",
