    "text": "There is, of course, no such thing as regional theatre. You simply cant lump\ntogether everything made outside London. Its like saying that Yarg is exactly\nthe same as Wensleydale cheese. The term regional theatre is, in any case, a\nhotly contested one; not least because some think that it has derogatory\nconnotations.\n\nOf course, the terms really dont matter a jot, and the problem with the word\nis not that regional can all too easily be emphasised with a London sneer, but\nthat it simply doesnt reflect the richness, variety and scale of the theatre\nproduced all over the UK. Whether that is theatre made in the UKs most\nnortherly arts centre in Lyth in Scotland, the shows that come out of a tiny\nvenue like Alphabetti in Newcastle, or the work produced by big houses in\nLiverpool or Leeds.\n\nThis is crucial to remember at a moment when, as The Stages editor Alistair\nSmith says, it is squeaky bum time for theatre, and the government needs to\ntake urgent action to save our industry, which is in crisis. To ignore that\ncry for help would be an act of cultural vandalism that will take many decades\nto repair.\n\nI heard someone say the other day that theatres may all be weathering the same\nstorm, but not everyone is in the same boat. I think thats true. Some vessels\n- particularly if you are a freelance artist or independent company - are\nleakier than others. But for theatre to survive and thrive and play its role\nin the countrys repair, we need the whole damn flotilla, from the bath tubs\nand inflatables to the oil tankers and everything in between.\n\nThat includes our regional theatres, which have a richness and complexity that\nnot only serves their local communities, but which seeps into and enriches\nother communities and theatres all across the country.\n\nThe loss of any regional theatre, whether it is Nuffield Southampton\nannouncing it has gone into administration or the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh\ntaking the painful decision to hibernate until next spring, is an immediate\ntragedy for that local community. But it has consequences beyond the immediate\nloss of art, including the damage done to the social fabric of that place and\nthe local economy.\n\nAs Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool \\- a city that has seen what culture\ncan do for local pride - says: Culture is the rocket fuel of the economy.\nLiverpools cultural sector tells us who the city is as much as its football\nteam does.\n\nThe loss of a single regional theatre also has an impact on the whole arts\necology and the diversity of the work that will be made in the future. Thats\nparticularly true when the future is likely to include many more co-\nproductions and partner venues.\n\nLondon theatres are seldom - with a few notable exceptions such as the Bush\nand Battersea Arts Centre \\- distinctly embedded and totally reflective of the\nlocal area they are situated in. The Donmar Warehouse could be anywhere in\nLondon, and the National Theatre is not of the South Bank, it just happens to\nbe situated there.\n\nLondon theatres rarely take on the hue of the places in which they are\nsituated or the spirit of that place in the way a great theatre out of London\ncan and often does. I was talking recently with Adam Penford, artistic\ndirector of Nottingham Playhouse, in the city in which he was born and raised,\nand he spoke of how what goes on stage must reflect the character of the city\nand its rebellious spirit.\n\nThats true of numerous theatres all across the UK. Every theatre is different\nin its reflections of the place and space in which it exists and the value\nthat it holds for local communities. It is what makes each and every single\none unique and special, not just within that local community but to the wider\narts ecology.\n\nA Kneehigh production may tour all over the world, but it is born out of the\nlandscape and spirit of Cornwall, just as much of the theatre produced from\nthe North East reflects that area of the country. It means we produce theatre\nand theatre artists whose work has a distinctive tang - a tang that often\nstays with them throughout their careers.\n\nNobody, least of all me, would deny that the National Theatre is a wonderful\nthing that serves a real purpose, and must be cherished and protected. Its\nNational Theatre at Home digital programme has brought joy to millions across\nthe world during lockdown. But I would also say that our real national theatre\nis to be found in the regional theatres, arts centres, fringe venues, local\nfestivals and village halls that are found all across the UK, which are\ndistinctive of space and place, and therefore distinctive in the work they\nproduce.\n\nThe crisis faced by regional theatre may not grab the headlines like that of\nbigger, sexier theatres in London, but it is the bedrock of our theatre\nculture and a beacon for communities. Without it, we bleed.\n\nLyn Gardner is associate editor of The Stage. Read her latest column every\nMonday: thestage.co.uk/author-lyn-gardner",

    "title": "Regional theatre is the bedrock of our culture \u2013 without it, we bleed",
    "html": "<p>There is, of course, no such thing as regional theatre. You simply cant lump together everything made outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location>. Its like saying that Yarg is exactly the same as Wensleydale cheese. The term regional theatre is, in any case, a hotly contested one; not least because some think that it has derogatory connotations.</p>\n<p>Of course, the terms really dont matter a jot, and the problem with the word is not that regional can all too easily be emphasised with a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> sneer, but that it simply doesnt reflect the richness, variety and scale of the theatre produced all over the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>. Whether that is theatre made in the UKs most northerly arts centre in Lyth in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.sco\">Scotland</location>, the shows that come out of a tiny venue like Alphabetti in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.newtle\">Newcastle</location>, or the work produced by big houses in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.liverp\">Liverpool</location> or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.leeds\">Leeds</location>.</p>\n<p>This is crucial to remember at a moment when, as The Stages editor <person>Alistair Smith</person> says, it is squeaky bum time for theatre, and the government needs to take urgent action to save our industry, which is in crisis. To ignore that cry for help would be an act of cultural vandalism that will take many decades to repair.</p>\n<p>I heard someone say the other day that theatres may all be weathering the same storm, but not everyone is in the same boat. I think thats true. Some vessels - particularly if you are a freelance artist or independent company - are leakier than others. But for theatre to survive and thrive and play its role in the countrys repair, we need the whole damn flotilla, from the bath tubs and inflatables to the oil tankers and everything in between.</p>\n<p>That includes our regional theatres, which have a richness and complexity that not only serves their local communities, but which seeps into and enriches other communities and theatres all across the country.</p>\n<p>The loss of any regional theatre, whether it is Nuffield Southampton announcing it has gone into administration or the Royal Lyceum in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.sco.edinbh\">Edinburgh</location> taking the painful decision to hibernate until next spring, is an immediate tragedy for that local community. But it has consequences beyond the immediate loss of art, including the damage done to the social fabric of that place and the local economy.</p>\n<p>As <person>Joe Anderson</person>, the mayor of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.liverp\">Liverpool</location> - a city that has seen what culture can do for local pride - says: Culture is the rocket fuel of the economy. Liverpools cultural sector tells us who the city is as much as its football team does.</p>\n<p>The loss of a single regional theatre also has an impact on the whole arts ecology and the diversity of the work that will be made in the future. Thats particularly true when the future is likely to include many more co-productions and partner venues.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> theatres are seldom - with a few notable exceptions such as the <org>Bush and Battersea Arts Centre</org> - distinctly embedded and totally reflective of the local area they are situated in. <org>The Donmar Warehouse</org> could be anywhere in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location>, and the <org>National Theatre</org> is not of the <org>South Bank</org>, it just happens to be situated there.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> theatres rarely take on the hue of the places in which they are situated or the spirit of that place in the way a great theatre out of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> can and often does. I was talking recently with <person>Adam Penford</person>, artistic director of <location>Nottingham Playhouse</location>, in the city in which he was born and raised, and he spoke of how what goes on stage must reflect the character of the city and its rebellious spirit.</p>\n<p>Thats true of numerous theatres all across the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>. Every theatre is different in its reflections of the place and space in which it exists and the value that it holds for local communities. It is what makes each and every single one unique and special, not just within that local community but to the wider arts ecology.</p>\n<p>A Kneehigh production may tour all over the world, but it is born out of the landscape and spirit of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.cornwa\">Cornwall</location>, just as much of the theatre produced from the North East reflects that area of the country. It means we produce theatre and theatre artists whose work has a distinctive tang - a tang that often stays with them throughout their careers.</p>\n<p>Nobody, least of all me, would deny that the <org>National Theatre</org> is a wonderful thing that serves a real purpose, and must be cherished and protected. <org>Its National Theatre</org> at Home digital programme has brought joy to millions across the world during lockdown. But I would also say that our real national theatre is to be found in the regional theatres, arts centres, fringe venues, local festivals and village halls that are found all across the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>, which are distinctive of space and place, and therefore distinctive in the work they produce.</p>\n<p>The crisis faced by regional theatre may not grab the headlines like that of bigger, sexier theatres in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location>, but it is the bedrock of our theatre culture and a beacon for communities. Without it, we bleed.</p>\n<p><person>Lyn Gardner</person> is associate editor of The Stage. Read her latest column every Monday: thestage.co.uk/author-lyn-gardner</p>",
