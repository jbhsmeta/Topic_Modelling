    "text": "BARSTOW -- A man accused of two armed robberies of local gas station\nconvenience stores is behind bars and expected to be arraigned in a\nVictorville courtroom Monday if charged by prosecutors.\n\nBarstow police arrested Montel Dion Sharp on Thursday morning after responding\nto two robberies wherein the suspect made off with cash from registers after\nthreatening to shoot the clerks.\n\nIn a photo provided by police, over $200 was pictured.\n\nPolice allege that Sharp entered USA Gas, at 1400 East Main Street, late\nWednesday night armed and left with cash from the register and three packs of\nNewport cigarettes.\n\nThe clerk told police the suspect was armed with a \"silver semi-automatic\nhandgun.\"\n\nIn the surveillance video, police say the suspect was wearing \"blue nitrile\nstyle gloves\" and a \"mask\" covering the bottom of his face.\n\nSeveral hours later, early Thursday morning, officers responded to another\narmed robbery in the same area at Circle K, located at 1501 East Main Street.\n\nPolice allege Sharp entered the store with the same description of gun and\ndemanded cash from two registers.\n\nOfficers learned the suspect fled in a black Mercedes SUV, with left front end\ndamage, and a clerk said he had a tattoo between his eyes and on the left side\nof his face.\n\nSgt. Jarell Gilmore found a black Mercedes SUV, with front end damage, in the\nDesert Inn Motel parking lot just before 7 a.m., police said.\n\n\"Officer's maintained surveillance of the vehicle while detectives learned\nthat the vehicle was associated with room 197 of the motel,\" police said.\n'Detectives knocked on the door of room 197 and talked to a male juvenile and\nblack male adult, later identified as Montel Dion Sharp, who had a tattoo\nbetween his eyes and on the left side of his face. Detective Thomas Lewis saw\nthat Sharp also matched the general physical description of the robbery\nsuspect.\"\n\nSharp was detained and officers obtained a search warrant for the room and\nSUV, and police allege that detectives found money and a silver colored BB\ngun, along with clothing and the blue gloves that matched the description in\nboth robberies. A witness also identified Sharp as the person in the\nsurveillance video of both robberies, police said.\n\nSharp was booked on suspicion of two counts of robbery and making a criminal\nthreat.\n\nSharp is being held at High Desert Detention Center in Adelanto in lieu of\n$200,000 bail, booking records show.\n\nJose Quintero may be reached at 760-951-6274 or\n[JQuintero@VVDailyPress.com](mailto:JQuintero@VVDailyPress.com).
