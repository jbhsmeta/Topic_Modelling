    "text": "As a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in my childhood and teen\nyears, we used to shout a slogan, \"A country can't have two constitutions, two\nPrime Ministers, and two national emblems.\" Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Dr\nSyama Prasad Mookerjee had coined this slogan. As a child, I never fully\nunderstood it, but I could comprehend Dr Mookerjee sacrificed his life in\nKashmir to integrate the nation. I also knew the then Prime Minister Jawahar\nLal Nehru did not listen to his homeminister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and\nimposed Article 370 to appease a handful of Muslims.\n\nEminent personalities such as Dr BR Ambedkar and Morarji Desai opposed the\nArticle and some Congress leaders supported them. It is the same as when INC\npresident Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi opposed the abrogationof the article,\nwhereasmany Congress leaders welcomed the decision.We thought that Article 35\n(A), which gives special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir will be\nrevoked, but home minister Amit Shah made the abrogation of Article 370\npossible. Within 24 hours, the state was divided into two centrally-governed\nUnion Territories.\n\nMarking the 144th birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, October 31, 2019, both,\nLadakh and Jammu and Kashmir were declared UTs. This was home minister Shah's\nway of integrating the nationand paying tribute to Sardar Patel, the Iron Man\nof India. Several such phenomenal and historic decisions were made since May\n30, 2019,from the first year of the second term of the Modi government.\n\nThis was a dream come true for me, for the nation. Prime Minister Narendra\nModi has risen as the world leader during this apocalyptical crisis. The far\nsightedness of our Prime Minister has saved the nation from the pandemic to a\ngreat extent. He has paved the way for the nation to become self-reliant. The\nintroduction of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 is\nan example that this government keeps its promises when in power. The Modi\ngovernment has also laid the foundation of the construction of the much\ncoveted and highly disputed Ayodhya's Ram Mandir. Modi government is working\nfor the welfare of the poor, labourers, farmers, industries, women, elderly\nand students. Each category was kept in mind while designing the relief fund\nof Rs20-lakh crore.\n\nPM Modi's first tenure was as golden. Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)\naims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with a\nclean cooking fuel -- LPG. Children now do not collect wood for cooking, but\ngo to school. Eight crore families now have access to LPG cylinders. Modi\ngovernment has done remarkable work for education, health, infrastructure and\nsanitation. Electrification of rural regions is also going on rapidly. The\ngovernment has also been able to fulfil the dreams of owning a house by the\npoor under the PM Awas Yojana.\n\nWe dreamt of abrogating the Article 370 and the Modi government has been\nsuccessful in fulfilling it. Today, we not just look at Bharatiya Janata Party\nas the largest political party in the world in terms of primary membership,\nbut also as the party of home minister Amit Shah, who made possible the\nrevocation of Article 370 and triple talaq.\n\nCountries like China and Pakistan surely had opposed the decision, but\nAfghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan,France, UAE and a couple of other\ncountries supported us by calling it as an internal matter. The Modi\ngovernmenthas succeeded inuniting thenationamid the pandemic. He recently\nvisited Odisha and West Bengalto evaluate the loss caused by Cyclone Amphan.\nPM Modi announced a central assistance of Rs1,000 crore for West Bengal,\ndespite the antics of its Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.\n\nOur salute to a legend like PM Narendra Modi, who transformed challenges into\nopportunities.",

    "html": "<p>As a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in my childhood and teen years, we used to shout a slogan, &#8220;A country can&#8217;t have two constitutions, two Prime Ministers, and two national emblems.&#8221; Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Dr <person>Syama Prasad Mookerjee</person> had coined this slogan. As a child, I never fully understood it, but I could comprehend <person>Dr Mookerjee</person> sacrificed his life in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/pk..kashmr\">Kashmir</location> to integrate the nation. I also knew the then Prime Minister <person>Jawahar Lal Nehru</person> did not listen to his homeminister <person>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</person> and imposed Article 370 to appease a handful of Muslims.</p><p>Eminent personalities such as Dr BR Ambedkar and Morarji Desai opposed the Article and some <org>Congress</org> leaders supported them. It is the same as when INC president <person>Sonia Gandhi</person> and <person>Rahul Gandhi</person> opposed the abrogationof the article, whereasmany <org>Congress</org> leaders welcomed the decision.We thought that Article 35 (A), which gives special status to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.jk\">state of Jammu and Kashmir</location> will be revoked, but home minister <person>Amit Shah</person> made the abrogation of Article 370 possible. Within 24 hours, the state was divided into two centrally-governed Union Territories.</p><p>Marking the 144th birth anniversary of <person>Sardar Patel</person>, <chron>October 31, 2019</chron>, both, Ladakh and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.jk\">Jammu and Kashmir</location> were declared UTs. This was home minister Shah&#8217;s way of integrating the nationand paying tribute to <person>Sardar Patel</person>, the Iron Man of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>. Several such phenomenal and historic decisions were made since <chron>May 30</chron>, 2019,from the first year of the second term of the Modi government.</p><p>This was a dream come true for me, for the nation. Prime Minister <person>Narendra Modi</person> has risen as the world leader during this apocalyptical crisis. The far sightedness of our Prime Minister has saved the nation from the pandemic to a great extent. He has paved the way for the nation to become self-reliant. The introduction of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019 is an example that this government keeps its promises when in power. The Modi government has also laid the foundation of the construction of the much coveted and highly disputed Ayodhya&#8217;s <person>Ram Mandir</person>. Modi government is working for the welfare of the poor, labourers, farmers, industries, women, elderly and students. Each category was kept in mind while designing the relief fund of <money>Rs20</money>-lakh crore.</p><p>PM Modi&#8217;s first tenure was as golden. <person>Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana</person> (PMUY) aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with a clean cooking fuel &#8212; LPG. Children now do not collect wood for cooking, but go to school. <money>Eight crore</money> families now have access to LPG cylinders. Modi government has done remarkable work for education, health, infrastructure and sanitation. Electrification of rural regions is also going on rapidly. The government has also been able to fulfil the dreams of owning a house by the poor under the PM Awas Yojana.</p><p>We dreamt of abrogating the Article 370 and the Modi government has been successful in fulfilling it. Today, we not just look at <org>Bharatiya Janata Party</org> as the largest political party in the world in terms of primary membership, but also as the party of home minister <person>Amit Shah</person>, who made possible the revocation of Article 370 and triple talaq.</p><p>Countries like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location> surely had opposed the decision, but <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/bd\">Bangladesh</location>, Bhutan,France, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ae\">UAE</location> and a couple of other countries supported us by calling it as an internal matter. The Modi governmenthas succeeded inuniting thenationamid the pandemic. He recently visited Odisha and West Bengalto evaluate the loss caused by Cyclone Amphan. PM Modi announced a central assistance of <money>Rs1,000 crore</money> for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.wb\">West Bengal</location>, despite the antics of its Chief Minister <person>Mamata Banerjee</person>.</p><p>Our salute to a legend like PM <person>Narendra Modi</person>, who transformed challenges into opportunities.</p>",
