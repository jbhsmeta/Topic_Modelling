    "text": "Sacramento: California Supreme Court has issued the following opinion:\n\n1\n\nFiled 6/5/20\n\nCERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA\n\nFIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nDIVISION FOUR\n\nIn re STEVEN L. HADEN,\n\non Habeas Corpus.\n\nA158376\n\n(San Mateo County\n\nSuper. Ct. No. SC042504)\n\nIn People v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120 (Gallardo), our Supreme Court\ndisapproved its prior decision in People v. McGee (2006) 38 Cal.4th 682,\n(McGee) and held that a trial court considering whether to impose a sentence\nenhancement based on a defendant's prior conviction may not make factual\nfindings about the defendant's conduct to impose the enhancement. Petitioner\nSteven L. Haden sought habeas relief in the Supreme Court based on Gallardo,\nclaiming that in 1999 the trial court treated two North Dakota robbery\nconvictions as strikes in contravention of Gallardo's holding. The Supreme\nCourt issued an order to show cause returnable to this court to decide whether\nHaden is entitled to relief under Gallardo, and whether Gallardo applies\nretroactively to final convictions.\n\nRecently, in In re Milton (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 977 (Milton), the Second\nDistrict Court of Appeal, in a thorough analysis of the retroactivity issue,\nheld Gallardo does not apply retroactively to final convictions. We agree with\nMilton. Because Gallardo does not apply retroactively to Haden's conviction,\nwhich became final almost 20 years ago, we need not determine whether he would\nbe entitled to relief under that decision, and we will deny his petition.\n\n2\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1998, Haden pleaded no contest to infliction of corporal injury on a spouse\n(Pen. Code, SS 273.5, subd. (a))1 and admitted a special allegation of\npersonal use of a deadly weapon (former SS 1192.7, subd. (c)(23)). After the\nplea, the trial court held a court trial on the special allegation that, under\nthe Three Strikes Law (see SSSS 667, 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)), petitioner\nsuffered two prior strikes based on two robbery convictions in North Dakota.\nThe court found the special allegations true and sentenced petitioner to 25\nyears to life in prison.\n\nHaden appealed, arguing the North Dakota robbery convictions could not\nconstitute strikes for sentencing purposes. We rejected Haden's argument and\naffirmed the conviction. (People v. Haden (Jan. 25, 2000, A086575) [nonpub.\nopn.].) Although the elements of robbery under North Dakota law differed from\nthose under California law, so that it could not be determined from mere fact\nof conviction that Haden had committed strikes under California law, we\nexplained that it was reasonable for the trial court to determine from the\nrecord in Haden's North Dakota cases that the two robberies \"were the\nequivalent of California robberies.\" (Ibid.) The Supreme Court denied Haden's\npetition for review (May 10, 2000, S086458).\n\nOver the next 15 years, Haden sought habeas relief on several occasions, both\nin the trial court and in this court. He was denied relief each time.\n\nIn October 2015, Haden filed another habeas petition in this court (A146612),\narguing that under the United States Supreme Court's then-recent decision in\nDescamps v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. 254 (Descamps),\n\n1 Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n3\n\nthe trial court made improper factual findings when treating the North Dakota\nconvictions as strikes. We denied the petition after concluding Descamps \"does\nnot apply retroactively to this case which has been final for more than a\ndecade.\"\n\nHaden then sought habeas relief in the Supreme Court (S230939), arguing that\nthe North Dakota robbery convictions did not qualify as strikes under\nDescamps. In March of 2016, the Supreme Court denied the petition \"without\nprejudice to any relief to which petitioner might be entitled after this court\ndecides People v. Gallardo, S231260.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court issued its opinion in Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th 120 on\nDecember 21, 2017. Disapproving its prior decision in People v. McGee, supra,\n38 Cal.4th 682, the Supreme Court held a \"court considering whether to impose\nan increased sentence based on a prior qualifying conviction may not determine\nthe 'nature or basis' of the prior conviction based on its independent\nconclusions about what facts or conduct 'realistically' supported the\nconviction.\" (Gallardo, at p. 136.) Such an inquiry, the court explained,\nviolates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because it\n\"invades the jury's province by permitting the court to make disputed findings\nabout 'what a trial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the\ndefendant's underlying conduct.' \" (Ibid.) \"The court's role is, rather,\nlimited to identifying those facts that were established by virtue of the\nconviction itself--that is, facts the jury was necessarily required to find to\nrender a guilty verdict, or that the defendant admitted as the factual basis\nfor a guilty plea.\" (Ibid.)\n\nOn May 7, 2018, Haden filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus in\nthe Supreme Court (S248706). He argued the trial court's imposition of the\nNorth Dakota robberies as strikes in 1998 contravened\n\n4\n\nGallardo because the court examined the record from the North Dakota cases to\ndetermine the factual nature of the prior convictions. After the Attorney\nGeneral submitted an informal response, the Supreme Court transferred the\npetition to this court with the following order: \"The Secretary of the\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation is ordered to show cause\nreturnable before the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division\nFour, when the matter is placed on calendar, why petitioner is not entitled to\nrelief pursuant to People v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120, and why Gallardo\nshould not apply retroactively on habeas corpus to final judgments of\nconviction.\" The Attorney General has filed a return opposing Haden's\npetition, and Haden, through appointed counsel, has filed a traverse. The\nmatter is now before us for decision.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaden argues that Gallardo should apply retroactively even though his\nconviction was final at the time Gallardo was decided. The retroactivity issue\nwas carefully considered in Milton, under circumstances similar in all\nrelevant respects to the situation here. The Second Appellate District's\nrecent opinion in that case analyzes the issue at length, and we see no reason\nto repeat that analysis here. Haden contends that Milton was wrongly decided\nand should not be followed, but each of his arguments was considered and\nrejected in that opinion. We agree with the analysis and conclusions of the\nSecond Appellate District and, like the Fourth Appellate District, follow its\nlead in holding that Gallardo does not apply retroactively to final\nconvictions. (See In re Scott (June 4, 2020, D076909) ___ Cal.App.5th ___\n[2020 Cal.App. Lexis 486, at p. *2] [following Milton and holding Gallardo\ndoes not apply retroactively to final convictions].)\n\n5\n\nAs the court in Milton explained, California courts generally apply two\nseparate tests--one federal and one state--when deciding whether new\nconstitutional rules of criminal procedure apply retroactively to final\nconvictions. (Milton, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at pp. 988-989.) The court began\nits analysis under the federal standard derived from Teague v. Lane (1989) 489\nU.S. 288. Under Teague, \" 'as a general matter, \"new constitutional rules of\ncriminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become\nfinal before the new rules are announced.\" ' \" (Milton, supra, at p. 988.) \"\n'Teague and its progeny recognize two categories of decisions that fall\noutside this general bar on retroactivity for procedural rules. First, \"[n]ew\nsubstantive rules generally apply retroactively.\" [Citations.] Second, new \"\n'watershed rules of criminal procedure,' \" which are procedural rules\n\"implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal\nproceeding,\" will also have retroactive effect.' \" (Id. at p. 989.)\n\nThe Milton court then concluded Gallardo is not retroactive under the federal\nstandard. The court began its analysis by explaining why Gallardo established\na new rule under federal law and was not merely an extension of Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi). (Milton, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at\np. 990.) Gallardo \"did not merely apply the holding of Apprendi to the\nrecidivist sentencing scheme in California.\" (Milton, at p. 991.) Instead,\nGallardo \"drew heavily on Descamps[, supra, 570 U.S. 254] and Mathis [v.\nUnited States (2016) ___ U.S. ___ [136 S.Ct. 2243] in holding a jury must find\nthe facts that support increased punishment based on recidivism.\" (Milton, at\np. 991.)\n\nNext, the Milton court explained that the new rule from Gallardo is\nprocedural, not substantive, \"because it prescribes the manner of finding\nfacts to increase the defendant's sentence.\" (Milton, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at\n\n6\n\np. 992.) \"Before Gallardo, the trial court, as authorized by McGee, could\nexamine the entire record of conviction to determine the 'nature or basis' of\nthe prior conviction based on its independent conclusion. [Citation.] After\nGallardo, the trial court can only look at a subset of this record, namely,\nfacts that 'the jury was necessarily required to find to render a guilty\nverdict, or that the defendant admitted as the factual basis for a guilty\nplea.' \" (Milton, at p. 992.)\n\nFinally, the Milton court determined that \"Gallardo, though significant, was\nnot a watershed rule of criminal procedure because limiting the role of the\ntrial court and the scope of what the court may review and consider to impose\nan increased sentence is not a rule ' \"without which the likelihood of an\naccurate conviction is seriously diminished.\" ' \" (Milton, supra, 42\nCal.App.5th at p. 994.) \"[T]he California Supreme Court did not reach this\nconclusion because a sentencing court's factfinding, or the kind of evidence\nsentencing courts used to consider in connection with that factfinding, was\nsomehow inaccurate or unreliable. Rather, the California Supreme Court in\nGallardo limited the role of the sentencing court in imposing increased\nsentences and the materials the sentencing court can consider to protect the\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment jury trial right.\" (Milton, at p. 995.) Having\nconcluded that Gallardo announced a procedural rule that fell short of being a\n\"watershed rule of criminal procedure,\" the court in Milton concluded that\nunder the federal standard Gallardo does not apply retroactively to final\nconvictions. (Milton, at p. 996.)\n\nThe Milton court then analyzed whether Gallardo applies retroactively to final\nconvictions under the California standard established in In re Johnson (1970)\n3 Cal.3d 404 (Johnson). The court explained that under Johnson, \" '[f]ully\nretroactive decisions are seen as vindicating a right which\n\n7\n\nis essential to a reliable determination of whether an accused should suffer a\npenal sanction. . . . [P] On the other hand, decisions which have been denied\nretroactive effect are seen as vindicating interests which are collateral to\nor relatively far removed from the reliability of the fact-finding process at\ntrial.' \" (Milton, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at p. 997.) \" 'If the new rule aims .\n. . to define procedural rights merely incidental to a fair determination of\nguilt or innocence, it will generally not be given retroactive effect.\n[Citations.] On the other hand, if a decision goes to the integrity of the\nfactfinding process [citation] or \"implicates questions of guilt and\ninnocence\" [citation], retroactivity is the norm.' \" (Ibid.)\n\nApplying Johnson's state-law standard, the Milton court once again concluded\nGallardo is not retroactive to final convictions. First, the court reiterated\nthat Gallardo \"established a new rule under state law because it 'disapproved'\nMcGee and the practice of judicial factfinding to support an increased\npenalty.\" (Milton, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at p. 997.) Next, the court explained\nwhy Gallardo did not vindicate a right essential to the reliability of a\nfactfinding process: \"[B]y limiting the sentencing court's role and limiting\nthe evidence the court can consider in determining whether to increase the\ndefendant's punishment, the California Supreme Court in Gallardo did not\nimpugn the accuracy of factfinding by trial courts. The Supreme Court in\nGallardo held that independent inquiry and factfinding by sentencing courts\nwere problematic because such actions 'invaded[d] the jury's province.\n[Citation.] As discussed, however, judicial factfinding is not inherently\nunreliable or less reliable than jury factfinding.\" (Milton, at p. 998.)\nFinally, the court stated that even if the question of retroactivity were a\nclose one, the disruption to courts caused by retroactive application of\nGallardo weighed against retroactivity: \"Applying Gallardo retroactively would\ncause\n\n8\n\nsignificant disruption by requiring courts to reopen countless cases, conduct\nnew sentencing hearings, and locate records of proceedings conducted long ago\nto ascertain 'what facts were necessarily found or admitted in the prior\nproceeding.' \" (Milton, at p. 999.)\n\nIn In re Brown (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 699, a divided division of the Fourth\nAppellate District disagreed with Milton and concluded that Gallardo is\nretroactive to final convictions. In reaching this conclusion, the court\nreasoned, under the state law retroactivity standard, that the Gallardo\nanalysis \"goes to the integrity of the factfinding process when the court\ndetermines whether a prior conviction qualifies as a strike. The primary\npurpose of the Gallardo rule is to promote reliable determinations of a\ndefendant's guilt or innocence in committing underlying acts, apart from the\nelements of a conviction, required to impose a strike.\" (In re Brown, supra,\nat p. 718.) We disagree. As the court explained in Milton, the rule from\nGallardo is grounded upon protecting the Sixth Amendment right to a jury\ntrial, not on the unreliability of judicial factfinding. (See Milton, supra,\n42 Cal.App.5th at p. 995.) \"[B]y limiting the sentencing court's role and\nlimiting the evidence the court can consider in determining whether to\nincrease the defendant's punishment, the California Supreme Court in Gallardo\ndid not impugn the accuracy of factfinding by trial courts.\" (Id. at p. 998.)\nIndeed, the United States Supreme Court has rejected the argument that judges\nare less reliable than jurors in holding that Apprendi, from which the new\nGallardo rule emanates, does not apply retroactively to final convictions.\n(See Schriro v. Summerlin (2004) 542 U.S. 348, 356 [\"When so many presumably\nreasonable minds continue to disagree over whether juries are better\nfactfinders at all, we cannot confidently say that judicial factfinding\nseriously diminishes accuracy.\"].) Hence, we agree with the court in Milton\n\n9\n\nand the dissent in Brown that the new rule prescribed in Gallardo is not a\nchange essential to minimize convictions of the innocent, and thus does not\napply retroactively to convictions that were final when Gallardo was decided.\n\nFor that reason, as well as the other reasons more fully set forth in Milton,\nHaden's petition must be denied.2 Having reached this conclusion, we need not\naddress whether Haden would be entitled to relief under Gallardo if the\ndecision were retroactive.3\n\nDISPOSITION\n\nThe petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.\n\nPOLLAK, P. J.\n\nI CONCUR:\n\nBROWN, J.\n\n2 While we do not dispute Haden's contention that a sentence imposed in excess\nof a court's jurisdiction may be challenged in habeas corpus proceedings, his\nsentence was imposed in compliance with then-existing procedures well within\nthe trial court's jurisdiction.\n\n3 We decline to address the Attorney General's argument that Haden's petition\nwas untimely because the issue is beyond the scope of the order to show cause\nissued by the Supreme Court.\n\n1\n\nTUCHER, J., Concurring.\n\nI agree with the majority and In re Milton (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 977 (Milton)\nin their application of the federal rule on retroactivity. The standard\narticulated in Teague v. Lane (1989) 489 U.S. 288 (Teague) almost never allows\nfor retroactive application on collateral review of a new rule of criminal\nprocedure (Welch v. United States (2016) __ U.S. __ [136 S.Ct. 1257, 1265]),\nand I agree that the rule set forth in People v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120\n(Gallardo) is both new and procedural. But federal law also leaves room for\nstates to be more generous in retroactively applying new procedural rules,\neven where a new rule is based on federal constitutional principles. (In re\nGomez (2009) 45 Cal.4th 650, 655, fn. 3 (Gomez).) Applying the approach to\nretroactivity that the California Supreme Court took in In re Johnson (1970) 3\nCal.3d 404 (Johnson), I conclude that Gallardo is fully retroactive to Haden's\ncase. But applying Gallardo to the facts of this case, Haden is not entitled\nto relief.\n\nI.\n\nFifty years ago, the California Supreme Court set forth in Johnson a test for\ndetermining the retroactive effect of a new precedent. (Johnson, supra, 3\nCal.3d at pp. 410-411.) The Johnson approach looks primarily to \" ' \"the\npurpose to be served by the new standards\" ' \" a case adopts, giving full\nretroactive effect to a decision that \"vindicat[es] a right which is essential\nto a reliable determination of whether an accused should suffer a penal\nsanction.\" (Ibid.) By contrast, precedents that promote interests \"collateral\nto or relatively far removed from the reliability of the fact-finding process\nat trial\" are not retroactive. (Id. at pp. 411-412.) In cases where this\npurpose enquiry is a close question, courts should also consider \"the extent\nof the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards\" and \"the\neffect\n\n2\n\non the administration of justice of a retroactive application\" of the new\nprecedent. (Id. at pp. 410, 413.)\n\nJohnson, when it was decided, reflected contemporaneous federal law, and in\nillustrating its approach to retroactivity, the California Supreme Court drew\non federal cases. (Johnson, supra, 3 Cal.3d at pp. 410-411.) For example, U.S.\nSupreme Court precedent gave full retroactive effect to rules designed to\nsecure the assistance of counsel at various stages of a criminal prosecution\n(Stovall v. Denno (1967) 388 U.S. 293, 297), to require a judge rather than a\njury to decide the voluntariness of a defendant's confession (Jackson v. Denno\n(1964) 378 U.S. 368, 376), and to protect a defendant's right to cross-examine\nwitnesses (Berger v. California (1969) 393 U.S. 314 [excluding preliminary\nhearing testimony of absent witness without good-faith effort to secure\nattendance at trial]; Roberts v. Russell (1968) 392 U.S. 293 [excluding\njointly-tried codefendant's extrajudicial statement]). All of these were\nprecedents deemed to enhance the reliability of fact-finding at trial, our\nSupreme Court explained. (Johnson, at p. 411.)\n\nJohnson also reviewed U.S. Supreme Court cases that had denied retroactive\neffect to new judicial precedents. For example, Mapp v. Ohio (1961) 367 U.S.\n643 and other cases excluding illegally-seized evidence were not retroactive\nbecause such precedents \"have no bearing on guilt or the reliability of the\nprocess by which it is tested.\" (Johnson, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 412\n[discussing Linkletter v. Walker (1965) 381 U.S. 618 and Desist v. United\nStates (1969) 394 U.S. 244].) The exclusionary rule is instead designed to\ndeter the constable's blunders. The once-new rules of Miranda v. Arizona\n(1966) 384 U.S. 436 and Escobedo v. Illinois (1964) 378 U.S. 478 were not\nretroactive \"because those cases seek to protect the right against self-\nincrimination with prophylactic measures,\" whereas the issue that affects the\n\n3\n\nreliability of a defendant's confession--whether it was voluntary--remained\nsubject to collateral review. (Johnson, at p. 412 [discussing Johnson v. New\nJersey (1966) 384 U.S. 719].) And cases requiring juries, rather than judges,\nto decide serious criminal cases were not retroactive because \"they did not\nrest on any assumption that nonjury trials are more likely than jury trials to\nbe unfair or unreliable.\" (Johnson, at p. 412 [discussing DeStefano v. Woods\n(1968) 392 U.S. 631 (DeStefano)].)\n\nThe issue the California Supreme Court decided in Johnson was whether to give\nretroactive effect to Leary v. United States (1969) 395 U.S. 6, a case that\neffectively prevented the government from prosecuting a person's failure to\npay the federal Marijuana Transfer Tax. (Johnson, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 409.)\nA person seeking to pay this tax was required to \"identify[] himself as a\ntransferee of marijuana,\" which created an unacceptable \" 'risk of self-\nincrimination,' \" according to Leary. (Johnson, at p. 409.) Although Johnson's\nconviction for failing to pay the tax was long since final--as was a\nsubsequent conviction alleging the federal tax conviction as a sentencing\nenhancement--our Supreme Court applied Leary to strike the prior conviction.\n(Ibid.) The Johnson court reasoned that Leary excludes the incriminating\nevidence and therefore renders \"innocent as a matter of law\" any defendant who\ninvokes the protections of the Fifth Amendment, so defendant Johnson was\n\"entitled to a retroactive application of Leary.\" (Johnson, at p. 416.)\n\nThe Attorney General asserts that Johnson and In re Joe R. (1980) 27 Cal.3d\n496 set forth current California law regarding the retroactivity of new cases,\nand Haden agrees. Joe R. articulates the same standard as Johnson (Joe R., at\np. 511), reaching a different result only because Joe R. examines the\nretroactivity of a Fourth Amendment case. As with other applications of\n\n4\n\nthe exclusionary rule, Joe R. reasons that the new precedent's \"aim was not to\nprotect the integrity of the factfinding process\" but \" 'to deter illegal\nconduct by law enforcement officials.' \" (Id. at pp. 511-512, italics\nomitted.)\n\nApplying the state-law standard of Johnson to the California Supreme Court's\ndecision in Gallardo, the majority concludes Gallardo is not retroactive\nbecause it does \"not vindicate a right essential to the reliability of a\nfactfinding process.\" (Maj. opn. ante, at p. 7.) To explain why I disagree\nwith the majority's conclusion, let me start with our common ground. I agree\nwith the majority that Gallardo does not \" 'impugn the accuracy of factfinding\nby trial courts.' \" (Maj. opn. ante, at p. 7.) Nor do I. If Gallardo had\nsimply transferred from judge to jury the responsibility to find certain facts\nunderlying a prior conviction, I would hold that the new rule was not\nretroactive. Johnson's embrace of DeStefano would require that result.\n\nBut Gallardo does something quite different. Instead of transferring\nresponsibility for finding certain facts from judge to jury, it withdraws from\nthe sentencing process entirely any finding of facts beyond \"those facts that\nwere established by virtue of the [prior] conviction itself.\" (Gallardo,\nsupra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 136.) Only those facts the prior \"jury was necessarily\nrequired to find to render a guilty verdict, or that the defendant admitted as\nthe factual basis for a guilty plea,\" may be taken to characterize the prior\nconviction. (Ibid.) Gallardo allows neither judge nor jury in the present case\nto supplement such previously-determined facts with new facts, whether gleaned\nfrom a review of the prior preliminary hearing transcript or otherwise\ndetermined. Supplementary fact-finding as to what were, at the time of the\nprior conviction, merely \" 'amplifying but legally extraneous circumstances' \"\nis simply not allowed. (Gallardo, at p. 133.)\n\n5\n\nJustice Chin's disagreement on this point drove him to dissent from Gallardo's\ndiscussion of remedy, and the court's response to his dissent reveals the\nbreadth of interests at stake. The dissent advocates for transferring to the\njury the supplementary fact-finding previously undertaken by the sentencing\njudge (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 140 (conc. & dis. opn. of Chin, J.)),\na remedy the court considered inadequate: \"[S]uch a proceeding--in which a\njury would be impaneled for the sole purpose of reading the preliminary\nhearing transcript in defendant's prior assault case--would raise significant\nconstitutional concerns,\" said the court. (Id. at p. 138.) Elaborating,\nGallardo explains that the Constitution requires \"facts that are used to\nincrease the defendant's maximum possible sentence\" to be \"proved in the same\nway\" as are elements of the offense, namely at a jury trial, by proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, with all \"the procedural safeguards, such as the Sixth\nAmendment right to cross-examine one's accusers, that normally apply in\ncriminal proceedings.\" (Id. at pp. 138-139.) A paper review of the sort the\ndissent proposes \"might involve a jury, but it would not be much of a trial.\"\n(Id. at p. 139.)\n\nBecause of different constitutional concerns, the Gallardo court also rejected\nas a remedy remanding to let a jury hear live testimony from witnesses to the\nprior offense. Although live testimony would allow for cross-examination,\n\"forcing the parties to relitigate long-ago events\" would \"threaten[]\ndefendants with 'harm akin to double jeopardy and denial of speedy trial,' \"\nthe court explained. (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 138.) These\nconstitutional interests animated precedent that neither the court nor the\nparties questioned in Gallardo, precedent that limited sentencing courts to\nconsidering the record of conviction on a prior offense. (Ibid. [discussing\nPeople v. Guerrero (1988) 44 Cal.3d 343].)\n\n6\n\nAll of this matters because Johnson requires us to identify \" ' \"the purpose\nto be served by the new standards\" ' \" Gallardo imposes. (Johnson, supra, 3\nCal.3d at pp. 410-411.) How better to determine the purpose of a new\nconstitutional rule than to examine what remedy the new rule requires? If\nMilton's and the majority's characterization of the interests at stake were\naccurate, then Justice Chin's proposal to transfer from judge to jury the task\nof reviewing the record of conviction would have been fully adequate to right\nthe constitutional wrong identified in Gallardo. Instead, we see a much\nbroader purpose at work. The court sought to ensure that all facts \"used to\nincrease the defendant's maximum possible sentence\" are established in a\nmanner that respects the defendant's right to a jury trial characterized by\nall \"the procedural safeguards, such as the Sixth Amendment right to cross-\nexamine one's accusers, that normally apply in criminal proceedings.\"\n(Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 138-139.)\n\nHaving thus identified the full range of constitutional interests that\nGallardo seeks to protect, it seems a simple matter to conclude that the case\n\"vindicat[es] a right which is essential to a reliable\" fact-finding.\n(Johnson, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 411.) Consider just one of the \"procedural\nsafeguards\" Gallardo mentions, the right to cross-examination. (Gallardo,\nsupra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 139.) Johnson itself recognizes that other cases\nprotecting aspects of the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses had\nbeen held to be fully retroactive. (Johnson, at p. 411 [discussing Berger v.\nCalifornia, supra, 393 U.S. 314 and Roberts v. Russell, supra, 392 U.S. 293].)\n\nMoreover, in addressing the facts of the case before it, Gallardo makes clear\nthat its new rule is squarely aimed at the reliability of fact-finding. In\nsentencing defendant Gallardo, the trial court had been required to determine\nwhether her prior conviction under former Penal Code section 245,\n\n7\n\nsubdivision (a)(1) (section 245(a)(1)) involved a deadly weapon. The trial\ncourt found that it did, relying solely on \"a transcript from a preliminary\nhearing at which the victim testified that defendant had used a knife during\ntheir altercation.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 136.) This was error,\nthe Supreme Court explained: \"A sentencing court reviewing that preliminary\n[hearing] transcript has no way of knowing whether a jury would have credited\nthe victim's testimony had the case gone to trial. And at least in the absence\nof any pertinent admissions, the sentencing court can only guess at whether,\nby pleading guilty to a violation of [section 245(a)(1)], defendant was also\nacknowledging the truth of the testimony indicating that she had committed the\nassault with a knife.\" (Gallardo, at p. 137.) In other words, the sentencing\ncourt's fact-finding was insufficiently reliable--not because a judge is less\ncapable of sorting fact from fiction than would be a jury--but because vital\ninformation was missing: Would a jury in the prior case \"have credited\" the\nvictim's testimony about a knife? Did the defendant \"acknowledg[e] the truth\"\nof that particular testimony? Left to \"guess at\" the answers to these\nquestions, the sentencing court could not reliably determine the dispositive\nfact. (Ibid.)\n\nBecause the rule of Gallardo goes to the reliability of fact-finding at\nsentencing, I conclude it is retroactive to this case. The three-part rule of\nJohnson would have us also consider the extent to which law enforcement has\nrelied on pre-Gallardo law and, relatedly, the disruptiveness inherent in\napplying the new rule retroactively, but these factors \"are of significant\nrelevance only when the question of retroactivity is a close one after the\npurpose of the new rule is considered.\" (Johnson, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 410.)\nAnd even if the question of retroactivity were a close one in light of\nGallardo's purpose, I conclude these two factors do not weigh heavily against\n\n8\n\nretroactivity. The Attorney General does not even mention reliance interests\nor the burden of disruption in arguing that Gallardo should not be\nretroactively applied.\n\nI acknowledge that some number of defendants are serving time on final\njudgments that will be subject to challenge if Gallardo is retroactive. This\ngroup includes defendants whose sentences were enhanced for an out-of-state\nprior from a state that defines certain crimes more broadly than does\nCalifornia, and defendants whose sentences were enhanced for prior convictions\nunder former section 245(a)(1). But when the California Supreme Court decided\nanother case with a similar potential to disrupt final judgments, it easily\ndetermined its new rule was retroactive. People v. Tenorio (1970) 3 Cal.3d 89,\ndecided just two months before Johnson, invalidated on separation of powers\ngrounds a statute that prevented trial courts in narcotics cases from striking\nprior convictions except on motion of the district attorney. (Tenorio, at pp.\n91, 95.) After deciding the merits of the challenge, the court added in a\nfootnote, \"[i]nasmuch as today's decision relates only to sentencing and will\nnot require any retrials, . . . it should enjoy fully retroactive effect.\"\n(Id. at p. 95, fn. 2.) By analogy here, Gallardo relates only to sentencing,\nwill not require any retrials, and by its own terms allows sentencing courts\nto consider only such documents as are already in the record on the prior\nconviction (and likely in the record on the offense of conviction as well).\n\nThe relative ease with which Gallardo may be retroactively applied comes into\nstark relief when we consider the far more disruptive effect of a rule whose\neffects are not confined to sentencing. A sister court declined retroactively\nto apply the limits on expert testimony that our Supreme Court set forth in\nPeople v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 686 because doing so\n\n9\n\n\"would be too disruptive and costly\" to the administration of justice. (In re\nThomas (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 744, 766.) Retroactivity for Sanchez would\nrequire \"reopening thousands of cases in which the prosecution\" had reasonably\nrelied on the prior rule, and in the ensuing years necessary evidence \"likely\nhas gone stale.\" (Id. at pp. 766-767.) By contrast here, before Gallardo the\nprosecution would have relied on paper records to prove certain facts about a\nprior conviction. After Gallardo, the court may look no further than those\nsame paper records, or perhaps a subset of them, to decide whether a\nsentencing enhancement is proper. Thus, the reliance of law enforcement on\npre-Gallardo case law and the disruptiveness inherent in retroactivity do not\nseem so extreme as to deny Gallardo retroactive effect.\n\nThe foregoing discussion comes with a significant caveat. I have assumed the\nparties are correct that Johnson is still good law. By 1989 the United States\nSupreme Court had moved decisively away from the purpose-based approach of\nJohnson,1 replacing it with an approach that asks first whether the legal rule\nin question was \"dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's\nconviction became final,\" or could properly be considered a \"new rule.\"\n(Teague, supra, 489 U.S. at p. 301, italics omitted.) Then, whether to apply a\nnew rule retroactively depends on whether defendant's conviction was final\nbefore the rule was announced and, if final, whether the new rule was\nsubstantive or procedural. Rules that are not new, or that are substantive,\nare fully retroactive; rules that are both new and procedural are, with\nvanishingly few exceptions, retroactive only to cases pending on direct\n\n1 Even in 1970, the California Supreme Court's approach to retroactivity\nappears to have been more generous in practice than the federal approach.\n(Compare Mackey v. United States (1971) 401 U.S. 667 [two decisions excluding\ngambling tax returns as self-incriminating are not retroactive] with Johnson,\nsupra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 416 [decision excluding marijuana tax return as self-\nincriminating is retroactive].)\n\n10\n\nappeal. (Teague, supra, 489 U.S. at pp. 310-311; Welch v. United States (2016)\n__ U.S. __ [136 S.Ct. 1257, 1265].)\n\nThe California Supreme Court has never adopted Teague, although it has\nsupplemented Johnson with principles that parallel Teague. For example,\nwithout reference to Johnson or Teague our Supreme Court has held that new\nrules that are substantive rather than procedural should be applied\nretroactively, even to cases that are final for purposes of appeal. (See In re\nMartinez (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1216, 1222-1223 [People v. Chiu (2014) 59 Cal.4th\n155, narrowing aider and abettor liability for premeditated homicide, is fully\nretroactive]; People v. Mutch (1971) 4 Cal.3d 389, 395-396 [finality is no bar\nto applying new kidnapping precedent that construes \"a substantive definition\nof crime duly promulgated by the Legislature\"].)\n\nThe California Supreme Court has also applied Teague in a case where it knew\nthat federal courts would have found retroactivity under Teague. The question\nin Gomez was whether Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 was\nretroactive to cases that became final shortly before Cunningham was decided.\n(Gomez, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 653.) The court held that Cunningham was\nretroactive because, after Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296, the\nconstitutional writing was on the wall, such that Cunningham could no longer\nbe considered a truly new rule. (Gomez, at p. 660.) State courts should\n\"provide a remedy on collateral review of a final judgment if that remedy\nwould be available in the federal courts,\" and federal courts would have\napplied Teague to find Cunningham retroactive, our high court reasoned.\n(Gomez, at pp. 655-656.) The logic of Gomez renders Teague a sort of one-way\nratchet. Precedents that federal courts would find fully retroactive under\nTeague apply retroactively in state court as well; precedents that under\nTeague apply only on direct review may nonetheless be\n\n11\n\nfully retroactive in state court, under the purpose-based approach of Johnson.\n(See Gomez, at p. 655, fn. 3.)\n\nWith the intervening sea-change in federal law governing retroactivity, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court may decide the time has come to revisit Johnson, and\nit will soon have the opportunity to do so. (In re Milton (Apr. 17, 2020,\nS259954) ___Cal.5th___ [2020 Cal. LEXIS 2736].) But as long as Johnson remains\nthe California approach to assessing retroactivity, I conclude Gallardo is\nfully retroactive.\n\nII.\n\nAlthough Gallardo applies to cases such as Haden's that were final before the\nCalifornia Supreme Court decided Gallardo, it turns out the rule of Gallardo\naffords Haden no relief. Haden challenges here the sentencing court's\ndetermination that his two prior convictions for robbery in North Dakota count\nas serious felonies and therefore \"strikes\" under California's Three Strikes\nlaw. (Pen. Code, former SSSS 1197.2, subd. (c)(23), 1170.12.) Haden correctly\nargues that North Dakota defines robbery broadly, sweeping in conduct that is\nnot a serious felony or a strike in California. But as we will see, the\noverbreadth Haden identifies is not dispositive because the charging documents\nin both of his North Dakota cases show that Haden pleaded guilty to conduct\nfalling squarely within California's definition of a serious felony and a\nstrike.\n\nNorth Dakota defines robbery to include threatening or inflicting bodily\ninjury \"in the course of committing a theft,\" even during an unsuccessful\nattempt to commit theft. (N.D. Cent. Code, SS 12.1-22-01.) \"It is therefore,\npossible under [North Dakota's] statute to commit robbery without committing\ntheft.\" (State v. McKing (N.D. 1999) 593 N.W.2d 342, 344.) Not so in\nCalifornia, where the crime of robbery requires a completed theft. (See\n\n12\n\ne.g., People v. Gomez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 249, 254.) Because North Dakota\nbroadly defines robbery, it is not enough to establish the alleged priors that\nHaden was twice convicted of that crime. The Attorney General concedes that \"a\nNorth Dakota robbery without a [completed] theft would not qualify as a\nserious felony or strike in California.\"\n\nHowever, the charging documents and judgments in Haden's North Dakota cases\nshow that in both robberies Haden completed his thefts. The sentencing court\nhad before it two criminal informations. One alleged Haden \"committed the\ncrime of Robbery, committed as follows: . . . he took $88.00 from another\nwhile threatening him with a dangerous weapon, a butcher knife.\" The other\nalleged Haden \"committed the crime of Robbery, committed as follows: . . . he\ntook property from another while threatening him with a dangerous weapon, a\nbutcher knife.\" Both charging documents specifically allege that Haden \"took,\"\n--that is, completed the theft of--the property in question. The informations\ndo not charge, nor were they amended to state, that Haden merely attempted to\ntake money or property from another. In both cases, the criminal judgments\nstate Haden was convicted by guilty plea of \"robbery as charged in the\nInformation.\"\n\nGallardo allows a sentencing court to determine, \"based on the record of the\nprior plea proceedings, that defendant's guilty plea encompassed a relevant\nadmission about the nature of [his] crime.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p.\n139.) The records in Haden's North Dakota plea proceedings establish that\nHaden indeed made relevant admissions. By pleading guilty \"as charged in the\nInformation,\" Haden admitted that both robberies involved completed, not just\nattempted, thefts. Haden admitted he \"took\" money and property by threatening\nhis victims with a knife. His prior convictions are, accordingly, serious\nfelonies and strikes under California law.\n\n13\n\nHaden disputes this application of Gallardo, arguing that here the sentencing\ncourt should not have looked beyond the elements of the North Dakota statute\nto which Haden pleaded guilty. He argues that the Sixth Amendment only allows\nGallardo's limited record review where a conviction was obtained under a\ndivisible statute, which is a statute that includes alternative elements, and\nthat North Dakota's robbery statute is indivisible. The problem with this\nargument is that Gallardo itself rejects it. Gallardo does discuss two United\nStates Supreme Court cases construing the Armed Career Criminal Act\n(\"ACCA\")--cases in which the difference between divisible and indivisible\nstatutes is important. (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 132-133 [discussing\nDescamps v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. 254, and Mathis v. United States\n(2016) ___U.S.___ [136 S.Ct. 2243].) But Gallardo cautions against confusing\nstatutory construction with constitutional mandate: \"[T]he high court did not\nhold that the Sixth Amendment, as opposed to the federal ACCA, forbids\" the\ncourt from conducting a limited record review \"when the statute of conviction\nhas a single, 'indivisible' set of elements (Descamps) or when it sets out\nalternative means, rather than alternative elements constituting the same\ncrime (Mathis).\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 134-135.) Because the\nfederal ACCA plays no part in this case, the distinction that Descamps and\nMathis draw between divisible and indivisible statutes is of no moment. The\nSixth Amendment does not require sentencing courts to distinguish divisible\nfrom indivisible statutes, and Gallardo does not import this distinction into\nCalifornia law. Gallardo is, for example, completely silent on whether former\nsection 245(a)(1) sets forth alternative elements or alternative means,\ndefining a divisible or an indivisible crime. This silence confirms that\nGallardo's limited record review is proper for priors obtained under either a\ndivisible or an indivisible statute.\n\n14\n\nIn sum, I conclude Gallardo is fully retroactive, but it affords Haden no\nrelief. I therefore join the majority in denying the petition for habeas\ncorpus.\n\nTUCHER, J.\n\n1\n\nBROWN, J., Concurring.\n\nI fully join the lead opinion, and I write separately only to explain certain\npoints of disagreement with the thoughtful analysis in Justice Tucher's\nconcurring opinion.\n\nIn my view, the concurrence places a significant amount of weight on portions\nof People v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120 (Gallardo) in which the Court did\nnot purport to address the purpose of its holding, for the simple reason that\nit had no need to. Citing certain parts of Gallardo, Justice Tucher deduces\nthat the Supreme Court's ruling was motivated by an unspoken purpose to\npromote reliability. (Conc. opn. ante, at pp. 5-6.) Impressed though I am with\nits eloquence, I am unconvinced by the concurrence's approach.\n\nFirst, the Court in Gallardo did not \"make[] clear that its new rule is\nsquarely aimed at the reliability of fact-finding.\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p.\n6.) Indeed, the word \"reliability\" and its cognates appear nowhere in the\nmajority opinion; it seems likely that if the Supreme Court had wished to\n\"make clear\" that the purpose of its holding was reliability, it could and\nwould have done so. In my view, Gallardo is instead focused upon no more or\nless than protecting the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial, as first\nembraced by the United States Supreme Court in Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000)\n530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi) and as more fully expounded upon in Descamps v. United\nStates (2013) 570 U.S. 254 (Descamps) and Mathis v. United States (2016) 579\nU.S. ___ [136 S.Ct. 2443] (Mathis). (Gallardo, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 124-125.)\nFollowing the high court's elucidation of Sixth Amendment principles in\nDescamps and Mathis, our Supreme Court held that \"the trial court violated\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial\" when it reviewed a\npreliminary hearing transcript to assess whether\n\n2\n\nthe prior conviction qualified as a serious felony. (Ibid.) The Gallardo Court\ncited Apprendi in explaining that \"when the sentencing court must rely on a\nfinding regarding the defendant's conduct, but the jury did not necessarily\nmake that finding (or the defendant did not admit to that fact), the\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment rights are violated. (See Apprendi, supra, 530\nU.S. at p. 490.)\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 135.) The Supreme Court\nfounded its reasoning upon Descamps' \"considered and unequivocal\" statement\nthat \"[t]he jury trial right is violated when a court adds extra punishment\nbased on factfinding that goes 'beyond merely identifying a prior conviction'\nby 'try[ing] to discern what a trial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed,\nabout the defendant's underlying conduct.' (Descamps, supra, 540 U.S. at p.\n269.)\" (Gallardo, at p. 135.) Thus, Gallardo's laser focus was on vindication\nof the jury trial right, without a further nod to any underlying motivation\nrelating to reliability.\n\nNotwithstanding the absence of the word \"reliability\" from Gallardo itself,\nJustice Tucher's concurrence infers a tacit purpose to promote reliability in\nthe majority's rejection of a jury trial remedy. The concurrence quotes\nGallardo as follows: \"[S]uch a proceeding--in which a jury would be impaneled\nfor the sole purpose of reading the preliminary hearing transcript in\ndefendant's prior assault case--would raise significant constitutional\nconcerns,' said the court.\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 5.) Missing from that\nquotation, however, are the final two words of the quoted sentence from\nGallardo. The full quotation from Gallardo reads as follows: \" '[S]uch a\nproceeding--in which a jury would be impaneled for the sole purpose of reading\nthe preliminary hearing transcript in defendant's prior assault case--would\nraise significant constitutional concerns under Apprendi.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4\nCal.5th at p. 138, underlining added.) Those two omitted\n\n3\n\nwords are important because, as the lead opinion correctly notes, the United\nStates Supreme Court has squarely held that cases protecting the Sixth\nAmendment jury trial right are not retroactive because the Court \"[could] not\nconfidently say\" that the judicial factfinding prohibited by Apprendi\n\"seriously diminishes accuracy.\" (Schriro v. Summerlin (2004) 542 U.S. 348,\n356 (Schriro).) In Schriro, the Court refused to give retroactive effect to\nRing v. Arizona (2002) 536 U.S. 584 (Ring), which had extended to Arizona's\ndeath penalty scheme the Apprendi rule requiring a jury finding on any fact\nthat would increase a penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum \"\n'[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction.' \" (Schriro, at pp. 350-351; see\nalso DeStefano v. Woods (1968) 392 U.S. 631, 633-634 (DeStefano) [cases\nextending Sixth Amendment jury trial right to states not retroactive].)\n\nSchriro was decided under the Teague v. Lane (1989) 489 U.S. 288 (Teague)\nstandard for retroactivity, and Justice Tucher's concurrence correctly notes\nthat the Teague retroactivity analysis is fashioned somewhat differently than\nthe pre-Teague United States Supreme Court standards adopted by our Supreme\nCourt in In re Johnson (1970) 3 Cal.3d 404 (Johnson). (See id. at p. 410\n[adopting and quoting the three-factor retroactivity test set forth in Desist\nv. United States (1969) 394 U.S. 244 (Desist)].) In Johnson, our Supreme Court\nheld that the first factor in the retroactivity analysis is the \" ' \"purpose\nto be served by the new standards,\" ' \" and explained that under United States\nSupreme Court precedent, \"[f]ully retroactive decisions are seen as\nvindicating a right which is essential to a reliable determination of whether\nan accused should suffer a penal sanction.\" (Johnson, at pp. 410-411.) Under\nthe Teague formulation, procedural rules given retroactive effect are those\n\"without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously\ndiminished.\" (Schriro, supra,\n\n4\n\n542 U.S. at p. 352, first italics added; see also Whorton v. Bockting (2007)\n549 U.S. 406, 418 (Whorton) [for a procedural rule to be retroactive, it must\nfirst be \"necessary to prevent 'an \" 'impermissibly large risk of an\ninaccurate conviction,' \" ' \" italics added].) The first factor of the Johnson\ntest and the first prong of the Teague retroactivity test for procedural rules\nare thus ultimately not so distinct, as they are both centered on the\nreliability, or accuracy, of convictions.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, in deciding Schriro, the Supreme Court specifically\nfound its decision in DeStefano--which was \"decided under [the] pre-Teague\nretroactivity framework\"--to be \"on point\" and \"germane\" to its analysis of\nwhether to give retroactive effect to Ring (and, by extension, Apprendi).\n(Schriro, supra, 542 U.S. at pp. 356-357.) As noted above, the \"pre-Teague\nretroactivity framework\" referred to in Schriro is precisely the three-factor\ntest adopted in 1970 by our Supreme Court in Johnson. (Johnson, supra, 3\nCal.3d at p. 410.) In DeStefano, after citing the same three-factor test later\nadopted in Johnson, the Supreme Court refused to give retroactive effect to\nDuncan v. Louisiana (1968) 391 U.S. 145 (Duncan), which applied the Sixth\nAmendment's jury trial guarantee to the states. (DeStefano, supra, 392 U.S. at\npp. 633-634 [\"[a]ll three factors favor only prospective application of the\nrule\" in Duncan, as the Court would not assert \" 'that every criminal trial--\nor any particular trial--held before a judge alone is unfair or that a\ndefendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury'\n\"].) Because the Supreme Court in Schriro followed its own \"on point\" pre-\nTeague jurisprudence in DeStefano, Schriro's refusal to grant retroactive\neffect to Ring and Apprendi sheds significant light on how Johnson applies to\nGallardo, which rests on the same Sixth Amendment jury trial right as\ndiscussed in Schriro and DeStefano. Put another way, that\n\n5\n\nSchriro was decided under the Teague standard for retroactivity does not mean\nwe can disregard it in assessing the question of how we should apply Johnson\nhere. Quite to the contrary, as Schriro's embrace of DeStefano shows.\n\nIn continuing with the theme of reliability, Justice Tucher's concurrence\nasks, \"How better to determine the purpose of a new constitutional rule than\nto examine what remedy the new rule requires?\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 6.) But\nas the concurrence itself points out, the remedy fashioned in Gallardo--\nwhereby a trial court determines which facts were necessarily found or\nadmitted in a prior proceeding--was intended to address not only the Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial, but also the Sixth Amendment right to a\nspeedy trial and the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy.\n(Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 138.) One cannot realistically divine a\nsingle unspoken \"purpose\" of Gallardo by looking at a remedy that had to\naccommodate multiple constitutional mandates. In any event, even if one\nfocuses solely on the remedy, it is evident that the remedy is directed at\ncorrecting violations of the right to a jury determination of a sentence-\nenhancing fact. A trial court applying Gallardo must assess what facts a jury\nnecessarily found, or what facts a defendant admitted after waiving the right\nto a jury determination as part of a plea.\n\nIn finding a \"much broader purpose at work\" (conc. opn. ante, at p. 6.),\nJustice Tucher's concurrence hones in on the Sixth Amendment's confrontation\nclause by quoting Gallardo's statement that facts used to increase a sentence\nmust be proved at a jury trial with all \" 'the procedural safeguards, such as\nthe Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine one's accusers, that normally apply\nin criminal proceedings.' \" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 6, quoting Gallardo,\nsupra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 138-139.) The concurrence,\n\n6\n\nhowever, fails to recognize that the United States Supreme Court has\ndetermined that Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36\\--its most\nsignificant confrontation clause case this century--is not retroactive to\ncases final on appeal. (See Whorton, supra, 549 U.S. 406.) Applying Teague,\nthe Court believed that the Crawford rule, which curtailed the use of\n\"testimonial\" hearsay, was not one \" ' \"without which the likelihood of an\naccurate conviction is seriously diminished.\" ' \" (Id. at p. 420.) Contrasting\nthe Crawford rule with the right to counsel recognized in Gideon v. Wainwright\n(1963) 372 U.S. 335, the Court explained: \"The Crawford rule is much more\nlimited in scope, and the relationship of that rule to the accuracy of the\nfactfinding process is far less direct and profound.\" (Whorton, at p. 419,\nitalics added.)\n\nIt is true, as Justice Tucher's concurrence explains, that under the pre-\nTeague standard, the United States Supreme Court gave retroactive effect to\nrules relating to a defendant's right to confront witnesses. But review of\nthose cases reveals they involved a right with a far stronger connection to a\nreliable determination of guilt or innocence than did Gallardo. In Roberts v.\nRussell (1968) 392 U.S. 293 (Roberts) the Supreme Court gave retroactive\neffect to Bruton v. United States (1968) 391 U.S. 123, a landmark\nconfrontation clause decision that precluded the admission of a nontestifying\ndefendant's confession that implicated a codefendant. (Roberts, at p. 295.) In\nBerger v. California (1969) 393 U.S. 314 (Berger), the Court gave retroactive\neffect to Barber v. Page (1968) 390 U.S. 719, where the Court held that the\nconfrontation clause prohibits the introduction of a witness's preliminary\nhearing testimony unless the prosecution has made a good faith effort to\nsecure the witness's presence at trial. (Berger, at p. 315.)\n\n7\n\nThe rules in Roberts and Berger thus remedied a situation where a defendant\nclearly lacked any ability to confront a witness at trial. With Gallardo, by\ncontrast, we can only speculate whether the denial of the right to have a jury\ndecide a sentence-enhancing fact also resulted in the denial of a defendant's\nseparate and distinct right to confront witnesses about that fact. And if one\ndoes engage in such speculation, there are many situations in which a\ndefendant will have received a sentencing enhancement without any\nconfrontation clause infirmity. Haden's case is illustrative, as he admitted\nthe sentence-enhancing fact of taking property (and therefore committing a\ntheft) when pleading guilty to robbery in North Dakota. This admission\neliminates any concern that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to\nconfront a witness about completing the theft. Even for a defendant who\nproceeds to trial under a robbery statute like North Dakota's, any concern\nthat the defendant was denied the right to confront witnesses about completing\na theft is minimal. Notably, a defendant charged with robbery in North Dakota\nwould be incentivized to cross-examine witnesses about whether he completed a\ntheft if it truly was a contested issue, as completion of the theft would be\nprobative of whether the defendant intended to commit a robbery, as\ndistinguished from mere assault or battery. In other cases, a defendant might\nnever challenge whether a theft was completed if, for example, the completion\nwas undisputed and his defense at trial was misidentification, as presented\nthrough alibi witnesses. What these examples (and many others) demonstrate is\nthat, unlike the rights at issue in Russell and Berger, the jury trial right\nvindicated in Gallardo is not necessarily tethered to a defendant's separate\nright confront witnesses. Rather, the right upheld in Gallardo is \"collateral\nto or relatively far removed\n\n8\n\nfrom the reliability of the fact-finding process at trial.\" (Johnson, supra, 3\nCal.3d at pp. 411-412.)\n\nThe concurrence also infers a purpose to promote reliability from Gallardo's\ndiscussion of the trial court's use of a preliminary hearing transcript to\ndetermine whether the prior conviction involved a deadly weapon. In quoting\nsnippets from Gallardo, Justice Tucher's concurrence states: \"In other words,\nthe sentencing court's fact-finding was insufficiently reliable--not because a\njudge is less capable of sorting fact from fiction than would be a jury--but\nbecause vital information was missing: Would a jury in the prior case 'have\ncredited' the victim's testimony about a knife? Did the defendant\n'acknowledg[e] the truth' of that particular testimony? Left to 'guess at' the\nanswers to these questions, the sentencing court could not reliably determine\nthe dispositive fact.\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 7.) But the portion of Gallardo\nquoted by the concurrence says nothing about the reliability of judicial fact-\nfinding. Instead, the Court's focus is on the identity of the fact-finder (or\nfact-admitter). A full quotation of the relevant portion of Gallardo makes\nclear this core concern: \"The Court of Appeal concluded this [review of the\npreliminary hearing transcript] was permissible under Descamps because that\ndecision allows trial courts to 'consult \"a limited class of documents, such\nas indictments and jury instructions,\" ' in order to identify which elements\nof the statute 'formed the basis of the prior conviction.' Because 'nothing in\nDescamps excludes the preliminary hearing transcript from that class of\ndocuments,' the court concluded that the sentencing court properly used the\ntranscript to determine that defendant's conviction was based on assault with\na deadly weapon and thus qualified as a serious felony within the meaning of\nthe Three Strikes law. [PP] While Descamps does permit courts to rely on\ncertain documents to identify the precise statutory basis for\n\n9\n\na prior conviction, the documents listed in Descamps\\--'indictments and jury\ninstructions' (Descamps, supra, 570 U.S. at p. 287)--differ from the\npreliminary hearing transcript here in a meaningful way. An indictment or jury\ninstructions might help identify what facts a jury necessarily found in the\nprior proceeding. (See Shepard[ v. United States (2005)] 544 U.S. [13,]\n20-21.) But defendant's preliminary hearing transcript can reveal no such\nthing. A sentencing court reviewing that preliminary transcript has no way of\nknowing whether a jury would have credited the victim's testimony had the case\ngone to trial. And at least in the absence of any pertinent admissions, the\nsentencing court can only guess at whether, by pleading guilty to a violation\nof Penal Code section 245, subd. (a)(1), defendant was also acknowledging the\ntruth of the testimony indicating that she had committed the assault with a\nknife.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 136-137, italics added.) When this\nportion of Gallardo is read in its full context, therefore, it becomes\napparent that the problem identified by the Supreme Court with the use of the\npreliminary hearing transcript was not that it was an unreliable method for\ndetermining what happened, as the concurrence seems to suggest; the problem\nwith using the preliminary hearing transcript is that it reveals nothing about\nwhat a jury necessarily found or the defendant necessarily admitted, as\nrequired to protect a defendant's Sixth Amendment jury trial right.\n\nFinally, Justice Tucher's concurrence may understate the disruptive effect of\napplying Gallardo retroactively to final convictions. The concurrence believes\nthat Gallardo can be applied retroactively to final cases with \"relative ease\"\nbecause it relates \"only to sentencing, will not require any retrials, and by\nits own terms allows sentencing courts to consider only such documents as are\nalready in the record on the prior conviction (and likely in\n\n10\n\nthe record on the offense of conviction as well).\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 8.)\nIt is not at all clear, however, that a Gallardo-compliant procedure can be\nundertaken with \"relative ease.\" A record of conviction oftentimes will lack\ncritical documents that would show whether defendant's guilty plea\n\"encompassed a relevant admission about the nature of her crime.\" (Gallardo,\nsupra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 139.) This includes a transcript of a defendant's plea\ncolloquy which, unlike a preliminary hearing transcript, may often not be\nrequested by a prosecutor or defendant, as neither party would need it for\nongoing proceedings in run-of-the-mill cases resolved by plea. (Cf. Pen. Code,\nSS 869, subd. (e) [requiring court reporter to create transcript of\npreliminary hearing within 10 days in any felony case in which a defendant is\nheld to answer, or upon request of either party in all other cases].)\nRetroactive application of Gallardo could force prosecutors to go on a\nscavenger hunt of sorts where they would have to augment a record by tracking\ndown old court files and personnel--no easy task for convictions, such as\nHaden's, that occurred decades ago in other jurisdictions.\n\nFor these reasons, I must respectfully disagree with Justice Tucher's view as\nto whether Gallardo is retroactive, although I agree that even if it were,\nHaden would not be entitled to relief.\n\nBROWN, J.\n\n1\n\nTrial court:\n\nSan Mateo County Superior Court\n\nTrial judge:\n\nHonorable Carl W.

HADEN</person>,</p>\n\n<p>on Habeas Corpus.</p>\n\n<p>A158376</p>\n\n<p>(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.santeo\">San Mateo County</location></p>\n\n<p>Super. Ct. No. SC042504)</p>\n\n<p>In People v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120 (Gallardo), our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme\nCourt</org> disapproved its prior decision in People v. McGee (2006) 38\nCal.4th 682, (McGee) and held that a trial court considering whether to\nimpose a sentence enhancement based on a defendant's prior\nconviction may not make factual findings about the defendant's\nconduct to impose the enhancement. Petitioner <person>Steven L. Haden</person> sought\nhabeas relief in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> based on Gallardo, claiming that in\n1999 the trial court treated two <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> robbery convictions as\nstrikes in contravention of Gallardo's holding. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>\nissued an order to show cause returnable to this court to decide whether\nHaden is entitled to relief under Gallardo, and whether Gallardo applies\nretroactively to final convictions.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, in In re <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 977 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>), the\n<org>Second District Court of Appeal</org>, in a thorough analysis of the\nretroactivity issue, held Gallardo does not apply retroactively to final\nconvictions. We agree with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>. Because Gallardo does not apply\nretroactively to Haden's conviction, which became final almost 20\nyears ago, we need not determine whether he would be entitled to relief\nunder that decision, and we will deny his petition.</p>\n\n<p>2</p>\n\n<p>BACKGROUND</p>\n\n<p>In 1998, Haden pleaded no contest to infliction of corporal injury\non a spouse (Pen. Code, SS 273.5, subd. (a))1 and admitted a special\nallegation of personal use of a deadly weapon (former SS 1192.7, subd.\n(c)(23)). After the plea, the trial court held a court trial on the\nspecial allegation that, under the Three Strikes Law (see SSSS 667,\n1170.12, subd. (c)(2)), petitioner suffered two prior strikes based on\ntwo robbery convictions in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location>. The court found the special\nallegations true and sentenced petitioner to 25 years to life in prison.</p>\n\n<p>Haden appealed, arguing the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> robbery convictions could\nnot constitute strikes for sentencing purposes. We rejected Haden's\nargument and affirmed the conviction. (People v. Haden (<chron>Jan. 25, 2000</chron>,\nA086575) [nonpub. opn.].) Although the elements of robbery under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North\nDakota</location> law differed from those under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> law, so that it could\nnot be determined from mere fact of conviction that Haden had committed\nstrikes under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> law, we explained that it was reasonable for\nthe trial court to determine from the record in Haden's <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North\nDakota</location> cases that the two robberies \"were the equivalent of\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> robberies.\" (Ibid.) The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> denied\nHaden's petition for review (<chron>May 10, 2000</chron>, S086458).</p>\n\n<p>Over the next 15 years, Haden sought habeas relief on several\noccasions, both in the trial court and in this court. He was denied\nrelief each time.</p>\n\n<p>In <chron>October 2015</chron>, Haden filed another habeas petition in this court\n(A146612), arguing that under the <org>United States Supreme Court's</org>\nthen-recent decision in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (2013) <location>570 U.S. 254</location>\n(<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>),</p>\n\n<p>1 Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Penal\nCode.</p>\n\n<p>3</p>\n\n<p>the trial court made improper factual findings when treating the\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> convictions as strikes. We denied the petition after\nconcluding <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> \"does not apply retroactively to this case\nwhich has been final for more than a decade.\"</p>\n\n<p>Haden then sought habeas relief in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> (S230939),\narguing that the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> robbery convictions did not qualify as\nstrikes under <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>. In March of 2016, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> denied the\npetition \"without prejudice to any relief to which petitioner might\nbe entitled after this court decides People v. Gallardo, S231260.\"</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> issued its opinion in Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th\n120 on <chron>December 21, 2017</chron>. Disapproving its prior decision in People v.\nMcGee, supra, 38 Cal.4th 682, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> held a \"court\nconsidering whether to impose an increased sentence based on a prior\nqualifying conviction may not determine the 'nature or basis'\nof the prior conviction based on its independent conclusions about what\nfacts or conduct 'realistically' supported the\nconviction.\" (Gallardo, at p. 136.) Such an inquiry, the court\nexplained, violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury\ntrial because it \"invades the jury's province by permitting\nthe court to make disputed findings about 'what a trial showed, or\na plea proceeding revealed, about the defendant's underlying\nconduct.' \" (Ibid.) \"The court's role is, rather,\nlimited to identifying those facts that were established by virtue of\nthe conviction itself--that is, facts the jury was necessarily required\nto find to render a guilty verdict, or that the defendant admitted as\nthe factual basis for a guilty plea.\" (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>May 7, 2018</chron>, Haden filed the instant petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> (S248706). He argued the trial court's\nimposition of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> robberies as strikes in 1998 contravened</p>\n\n<p>4</p>\n\n<p>Gallardo because the court examined the record from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North\nDakota</location> cases to determine the factual nature of the prior convictions.\nAfter the Attorney General submitted an informal response, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme\nCourt</org> transferred the petition to this court with the following order:\n\"The Secretary of the <org>Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</org>\nis ordered to show cause returnable before the <org>Court of Appeal</org>, <location>First\nAppellate District</location>, Division Four, when the matter is placed on\ncalendar, why petitioner is not entitled to relief pursuant to People v.\nGallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120, and why Gallardo should not apply\nretroactively on habeas corpus to final judgments of conviction.\"\nThe Attorney General has filed a return opposing Haden's petition,\nand Haden, through appointed counsel, has filed a traverse.

The\nretroactivity issue was carefully considered in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, under\ncircumstances similar in all relevant respects to the situation here.\n<location>The Second Appellate District's</location> recent opinion in that case\nanalyzes the issue at length, and we see no reason to repeat that\nanalysis here. Haden contends that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> was wrongly decided and should\nnot be followed, but each of his arguments was considered and rejected\nin that opinion. We agree with the analysis and conclusions of the\n<location>Second Appellate District</location> and, like the <location>Fourth Appellate District</location>,\nfollow its lead in holding that Gallardo does not apply retroactively to\nfinal convictions. (See In re Scott (<chron>June 4, 2020</chron>, D076909) ___\nCal.App.5th ___ [2020 Cal.App. Lexis 486, at p. *2] [following <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>\nand holding Gallardo does not apply retroactively to final\nconvictions].)</p>\n\n<p>5</p>\n\n<p>As the court in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> explained, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> courts generally apply\ntwo separate tests--one federal and one state--when deciding whether new\nconstitutional rules of criminal procedure apply retroactively to final\nconvictions. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at pp. 988-989.) The court\nbegan its analysis under the federal standard derived from Teague v.\nLane (1989) <location>489 U.S. 288</location>. Under Teague, \" 'as a general\nmatter, \"new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be\napplicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules\nare announced.\" ' \" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, supra, at p. 988.) \"\n'Teague and its progeny recognize two categories of decisions that\nfall outside this general bar on retroactivity for procedural rules.\nFirst, \"[n]ew substantive rules generally apply\nretroactively.\" [Citations.] Second, new \" 'watershed\nrules of criminal procedure,' \" which are procedural rules\n\"implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal\nproceeding,\" will also have retroactive effect.' \" (Id.\nat p. 989.)</p>\n\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> court then concluded Gallardo is not retroactive under\nthe federal standard. The court began its analysis by explaining why\nGallardo established a new rule under federal law and was not merely an\nextension of Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) <location>530 U.S. 466</location> (Apprendi).\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at p. 990.) Gallardo \"did not merely\napply the holding of Apprendi to the recidivist sentencing scheme in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 991.) Instead, Gallardo \"drew\nheavily on <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>[, supra, <location>570 U.S. 254</location>] and Mathis [v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>\n(2016) ___ <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> ___ [136 S.Ct. 2243] in holding a jury must find the\nfacts that support increased punishment based on recidivism.\"\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 991.)</p>\n\n<p>Next, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> court explained that the new rule from Gallardo is\nprocedural, not substantive, \"because it prescribes the manner of\nfinding facts to increase the defendant's sentence.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>,\nsupra, 42 Cal.App.5th at</p>\n\n<p>6</p>\n\n<p>p. 992.) \"Before Gallardo, the trial court, as authorized by\nMcGee, could examine the entire record of conviction to determine the\n'nature or basis' of the prior conviction based on its\nindependent conclusion. [Citation.] After Gallardo, the trial court can\nonly look at a subset of this record, namely, facts that 'the jury\nwas necessarily required to find to render a guilty verdict, or that the\ndefendant admitted as the factual basis for a guilty plea.' \"\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 992.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> court determined that \"Gallardo, though\nsignificant, was not a watershed rule of criminal procedure because\nlimiting the role of the trial court and the scope of what the court may\nreview and consider to impose an increased sentence is not a rule '\n\"without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is\nseriously diminished.\" ' \" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 994.) \"[T]he <org>California Supreme Court</org> did not reach this\nconclusion because a sentencing court's factfinding, or the kind of\nevidence sentencing courts used to consider in connection with that\nfactfinding, was somehow inaccurate or unreliable. Rather, the\n<org>California Supreme Court</org> in Gallardo limited the role of the sentencing\ncourt in imposing increased sentences and the materials the sentencing\ncourt can consider to protect the defendant's Sixth Amendment jury\ntrial right.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 995.) Having concluded that Gallardo\nannounced a procedural rule that fell short of being a \"watershed\nrule of criminal procedure,\" the court in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> concluded that\nunder the federal standard Gallardo does not apply retroactively to\nfinal convictions. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 996.)</p>\n\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> court then analyzed whether Gallardo applies\nretroactively to final convictions under the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> standard\nestablished in In re <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> (1970) 3 Cal.3d 404 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>). The court\nexplained that under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, \" '[f]ully retroactive decisions\nare seen as vindicating a right which</p>\n\n<p>7</p>\n\n<p>is essential to a reliable determination of whether an accused\nshould suffer a penal sanction. . . . [P] On the other hand, decisions\nwhich have been denied retroactive effect are seen as vindicating\ninterests which are collateral to or relatively far removed from the\nreliability of the fact-finding process at trial.' \" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>,\nsupra, 42 Cal.App.5th at p. 997.) \" 'If the new rule aims . .\n. to define procedural rights merely incidental to a fair determination\nof guilt or innocence, it will generally not be given retroactive\neffect. [Citations.] On the other hand, if a decision goes to the\nintegrity of the factfinding process [citation] or \"implicates\nquestions of guilt and innocence\" [citation], retroactivity is the\nnorm.' \" (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>Applying <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson's</location> state-law standard, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> court once\nagain concluded Gallardo is not retroactive to final convictions. First,\nthe court reiterated that Gallardo \"established a new rule under\nstate law because it 'disapproved' McGee and the practice of\njudicial factfinding to support an increased penalty.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>,\nsupra, 42 Cal.App.5th at p. 997.) Next, the court explained why Gallardo\ndid not vindicate a right essential to the reliability of a factfinding\nprocess: \"[B]y limiting the sentencing court's role and\nlimiting the evidence the court can consider in determining whether to\nincrease the defendant's punishment, the <org>California Supreme Court</org>\nin Gallardo did not impugn the accuracy of factfinding by trial courts.\nThe <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> in Gallardo held that independent inquiry and\nfactfinding by sentencing courts were problematic because such actions\n'invaded[d] the jury's province. [Citation.] As discussed,\nhowever, judicial factfinding is not inherently unreliable or less\nreliable than jury factfinding.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 998.) Finally, the\ncourt stated that even if the question of retroactivity were a close\none, the disruption to courts caused by retroactive application of\nGallardo weighed against retroactivity: \"Applying Gallardo\nretroactively would cause</p>\n\n<p>8</p>\n\n<p>significant disruption by requiring courts to reopen countless\ncases, conduct new sentencing hearings, and locate records of\nproceedings conducted long ago to ascertain 'what facts were\nnecessarily found or admitted in the prior proceeding.' \"\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, at p. 999.)</p>\n\n<p>In In re Brown (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 699, a divided division of the\n<location>Fourth Appellate District</location> disagreed with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> and concluded that\nGallardo is retroactive to final convictions. In reaching this\nconclusion, the court reasoned, under the state law retroactivity\nstandard, that the Gallardo analysis \"goes to the integrity of the\nfactfinding process when the court determines whether a prior conviction\nqualifies as a strike. The primary purpose of the Gallardo rule is to\npromote reliable determinations of a defendant's guilt or innocence\nin committing underlying acts, apart from the elements of a conviction,\nrequired to impose a strike.\" (In re Brown, supra, at p. 718.) We\ndisagree. As the court explained in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, the rule from Gallardo is\ngrounded upon protecting the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, not\non the unreliability of judicial factfinding. (See Milton, supra, 42\nCal.App.5th at p. 995.) \"[B]y limiting the sentencing court's\nrole and limiting the evidence the court can consider in determining\nwhether to increase the defendant's punishment, the <org>California\nSupreme Court</org> in Gallardo did not impugn the accuracy of factfinding by\ntrial courts.\" (Id. at p. 998.) Indeed, the <org>United States Supreme\nCourt</org> has rejected the argument that judges are less reliable than\njurors in holding that Apprendi, from which the new Gallardo rule\nemanates, does not apply retroactively to final convictions. (See\nSchriro v. Summerlin (2004) <location>542 U.S. 348</location>, 356 [\"When so many\npresumably reasonable minds continue to disagree over whether juries are\nbetter factfinders at all, we cannot confidently say that judicial\nfactfinding seriously diminishes accuracy.\"].) Hence, we agree with\nthe court in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location></p>\n\n<p>9</p>\n\n<p>and the dissent in Brown that the new rule prescribed in Gallardo\nis not a change essential to minimize convictions of the innocent, and\nthus does not apply retroactively to convictions that were final when\nGallardo was decided.</p>\n\n<p>For that reason, as well as the other reasons more fully set forth\nin <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>, Haden's petition must be denied.2 Having reached this\nconclusion, we need not address whether Haden would be entitled to\nrelief under Gallardo if the decision were retroactive.3</p>\n\n<p>DISPOSITION</p>\n\n<p>The petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n\n<p>POLLAK, P. J.</p>\n\n<p>I CONCUR:</p>\n\n<p>BROWN, J.</p>\n\n<p>2 While we do not dispute Haden's contention that a sentence\nimposed in excess of a court's jurisdiction may be challenged in\nhabeas corpus proceedings, his sentence was imposed in compliance with\nthen-existing procedures well within the trial court's\njurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>3 We decline to address the Attorney General's argument that\nHaden's petition was untimely because the issue is beyond the scope\nof the order to show cause issued by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>.</p>\n\n<p>1</p>\n\n<p>TUCHER, J., Concurring.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with the majority and In re <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th\n977 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location>) in their application of the federal rule on retroactivity.\nThe standard articulated in Teague v. Lane (1989) <location>489 U.S. 288</location> (Teague)\nalmost never allows for retroactive application on collateral review of\na new rule of criminal procedure (Welch v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (2016) __ <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>\n__ [136 S.Ct. 1257, 1265]), and I agree that the rule set forth in\nPeople v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120 (Gallardo) is both new and\nprocedural. But federal law also leaves room for states to be more\ngenerous in retroactively applying new procedural rules, even where a\nnew rule is based on federal constitutional principles. (In re Gomez\n(2009) 45 Cal.4th 650, 655, fn. 3 (Gomez).) Applying the approach to\nretroactivity that the <org>California Supreme Court</org> took in In re <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>\n(1970) 3 Cal.3d 404 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>), I conclude that Gallardo is fully\nretroactive to Haden's case. But applying Gallardo to the facts of\nthis case, Haden is not entitled to relief.</p>\n\n<p>I.</p>\n\n<p>Fifty years ago, the <org>California Supreme Court</org> set forth in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>\na test for determining the retroactive effect of a new precedent.\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at pp. 410-411.) The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> approach looks\nprimarily to \" ' \"the purpose to be served by the new\nstandards\" ' \" a case adopts, giving full retroactive\neffect to a decision that \"vindicat[es] a right which is essential\nto a reliable determination of whether an accused should suffer a penal\nsanction.\" (Ibid.) By contrast, precedents that promote interests\n\"collateral to or relatively far removed from the reliability of\nthe fact-finding process at trial\" are not retroactive. (Id. at pp.\n411-412.) In cases where this purpose enquiry is a close question,\ncourts should also consider \"the extent of the reliance by law\nenforcement authorities on the old standards\" and \"the effect</p>\n\n<p>2</p>\n\n<p>on the administration of justice of a retroactive application\"\nof the new precedent. (Id. at pp. 410, 413.)</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, when it was decided, reflected contemporaneous federal\nlaw, and in illustrating its approach to retroactivity, the <org>California\nSupreme Court</org> drew on federal cases. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at pp.\n410-411.) For example, <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> precedent gave full\nretroactive effect to rules designed to secure the assistance of counsel\nat various stages of a criminal prosecution (Stovall v. Denno (1967) <location>388\nU.S. 293</location>, 297), to require a judge rather than a jury to decide the\nvoluntariness of a defendant's confession (Jackson v. Denno (1964)\n<location>378 U.S. 368</location>, 376), and to protect a defendant's right to\ncross-examine witnesses (Berger v. California (1969) <location>393 U.S. 314</location>\n[excluding preliminary hearing testimony of absent witness without\ngood-faith effort to secure attendance at trial]; Roberts v. Russell\n(1968) <location>392 U.S. 293</location> [excluding jointly-tried codefendant's\nextrajudicial statement]). All of these were precedents deemed to\nenhance the reliability of fact-finding at trial, our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>\nexplained. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at p. 411.)</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> also reviewed <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org> cases that had denied\nretroactive effect to new judicial precedents. For example, Mapp v. Ohio\n(1961) <location>367 U.S. 643</location> and other cases excluding illegally-seized evidence\nwere not retroactive because such precedents \"have no bearing on\nguilt or the reliability of the process by which it is tested.\"\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 412 [discussing Linkletter v.

The once-new rules of Miranda v.

(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at p. 412\n[discussing Johnson v. New Jersey (1966) <location>384 U.S. 719</location>].) And cases\nrequiring juries, rather than judges, to decide serious criminal cases\nwere not retroactive because \"they did not rest on any assumption\nthat nonjury trials are more likely than jury trials to be unfair or\nunreliable.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at p. 412 [discussing DeStefano v. Woods\n(1968) <location>392 U.S. 631</location> (DeStefano)].)</p>\n\n<p>The issue the <org>California Supreme Court</org> decided in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> was\nwhether to give retroactive effect to Leary v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (1969) <location>395\nU.S. 6</location>, a case that effectively prevented the government from\nprosecuting a person's failure to pay the federal Marijuana\nTransfer Tax. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 409.) A person seeking to\npay this tax was required to \"identify[] himself as a transferee of\nmarijuana,\" which created an unacceptable \" 'risk of\nself-incrimination,' \" according to Leary. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at p.\n409.) Although <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson's</location> conviction for failing to pay the tax was\nlong since final--as was a subsequent conviction alleging the federal\ntax conviction as a sentencing enhancement--our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> applied\nLeary to strike the prior conviction. (Ibid.) The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> court reasoned\nthat Leary excludes the incriminating evidence and therefore renders\n\"innocent as a matter of law\" any defendant who invokes the\nprotections of the Fifth Amendment, so defendant <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> was\n\"entitled to a retroactive application of Leary.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at\np. 416.)</p>\n\n<p>The Attorney General asserts that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> and In re Joe R. (1980)\n27 Cal.3d 496 set forth current <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> law regarding the\nretroactivity of new cases, and Haden agrees. Joe R. articulates the\nsame standard as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> (Joe R., at p. 511), reaching a different\nresult only because Joe R. examines the retroactivity of a Fourth\nAmendment case. As with other applications of</p>\n\n<p>4</p>\n\n<p>the exclusionary rule, Joe R. reasons that the new precedent's\n\"aim was not to protect the integrity of the factfinding\nprocess\" but \" 'to deter illegal conduct by law\nenforcement officials.' \" (Id. at pp. 511-512, italics\nomitted.)</p>\n\n<p>Applying the state-law standard of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> to the <org>California\nSupreme Court's</org> decision in Gallardo, the majority concludes\nGallardo is not retroactive because it does \"not vindicate a right\nessential to the reliability of a factfinding process.\" (Maj. opn.\nante, at p. 7.) To explain why I disagree with the majority's\nconclusion, let me start with our common ground. I agree with the\nmajority that Gallardo does not \" 'impugn the accuracy of\nfactfinding by trial courts.' \" (Maj. opn. ante, at p. 7.) Nor\ndo <person>I. If Gallardo</person> had simply transferred from judge to jury the\nresponsibility to find certain facts underlying a prior conviction, I\nwould hold that the new rule was not retroactive. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson's</location> embrace\nof DeStefano would require that result.</p>\n\n<p>But Gallardo does something quite different. Instead of\ntransferring responsibility for finding certain facts from judge to\njury, it withdraws from the sentencing process entirely any finding of\nfacts beyond \"those facts that were established by virtue of the\n[prior] conviction itself.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 136.)\nOnly those facts the prior \"jury was necessarily required to find\nto render a guilty verdict, or that the defendant admitted as the\nfactual basis for a guilty plea,\" may be taken to characterize the\nprior conviction. (Ibid.) Gallardo allows neither judge nor jury in the\npresent case to supplement such previously-determined facts with new\nfacts, whether gleaned from a review of the prior preliminary hearing\ntranscript or otherwise determined. Supplementary fact-finding as to\nwhat were, at the time of the prior conviction, merely \"\n'amplifying but legally extraneous circumstances' \" is\nsimply not allowed. (Gallardo, at p. 133.)</p>\n\n<p>5</p>\n\n<p><person>Justice Chin's</person> disagreement on this point drove him to dissent\nfrom Gallardo's discussion of remedy, and the court's response\nto his dissent reveals the breadth of interests at stake. The dissent\nadvocates for transferring to the jury the supplementary fact-finding\npreviously undertaken by the sentencing judge (Gallardo, supra, 4\nCal.5th at p. 140 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Chin, J.)), a remedy the\ncourt considered inadequate: \"[S]uch a proceeding--in which a jury\nwould be impaneled for the sole purpose of reading the preliminary\nhearing transcript in defendant's prior assault case--would raise\nsignificant constitutional concerns,\" said the court. (Id. at p.\n138.) Elaborating, Gallardo explains that the <org>Constitution</org> requires\n\"facts that are used to increase the defendant's maximum\npossible sentence\" to be \"proved in the same way\" as are\nelements of the offense, namely at a jury trial, by proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, with all \"the procedural safeguards, such as the\nSixth Amendment right to cross-examine one's accusers, that\nnormally apply in criminal proceedings.\" (Id. at pp. 138-139.) A\npaper review of the sort the dissent proposes \"might involve a\njury, but it would not be much of a trial.\" (Id. at p. 139.)</p>\n\n<p>Because of different constitutional concerns, the Gallardo court\nalso rejected as a remedy remanding to let a jury hear live testimony\nfrom witnesses to the prior offense. Although live testimony would allow\nfor cross-examination, \"forcing the parties to relitigate long-ago\nevents\" would \"threaten[] defendants with 'harm akin to\ndouble jeopardy and denial of speedy trial,' \" the court\nexplained. (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 138.) These constitutional\ninterests animated precedent that neither the court nor the parties\nquestioned in Gallardo, precedent that limited sentencing courts to\nconsidering the record of conviction on a prior offense. (Ibid.\n[discussing People v. Guerrero (1988) 44 Cal.3d 343].)</p>\n\n<p>6</p>\n\n<p>All of this matters because <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> requires us to identify \"\n' \"the purpose to be served by the new standards\" '\n\" Gallardo imposes. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at pp. 410-411.) How\nbetter to determine the purpose of a new constitutional rule than to\nexamine what remedy the new rule requires? If <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton's</location> and the\nmajority's characterization of the interests at stake were\naccurate, then <person>Justice Chin's</person> proposal to transfer from judge to\njury the task of reviewing the record of conviction would have been\nfully adequate to right the constitutional wrong identified in Gallardo.\nInstead, we see a much broader purpose at work. The court sought to\nensure that all facts \"used to increase the defendant's\nmaximum possible sentence\" are established in a manner that\nrespects the defendant's right to a jury trial characterized by all\n\"the procedural safeguards, such as the Sixth Amendment right to\ncross-examine one's accusers, that normally apply in criminal\nproceedings.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 138-139.)</p>\n\n<p>Having thus identified the full range of constitutional interests\nthat Gallardo seeks to protect, it seems a simple matter to conclude\nthat the case \"vindicat[es] a right which is essential to a\nreliable\" fact-finding. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 411.)\nConsider just one of the \"procedural safeguards\" Gallardo\nmentions, the right to cross-examination. (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at\np. 139.) <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> itself recognizes that other cases protecting aspects\nof the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses had been held to be\nfully retroactive. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at p. 411 [discussing Berger v. California,\nsupra, <location>393 U.S. 314</location> and Roberts v. Russell, supra, <location>392 U.S. 293</location>].)</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, in addressing the facts of the case before it, Gallardo\nmakes clear that its new rule is squarely aimed at the reliability of\nfact-finding. In sentencing defendant Gallardo, the trial court had been\nrequired to determine whether her prior conviction under former Penal\nCode section 245,</p>\n\n<p>7</p>\n\n<p>subdivision (a)(1) (section 245(a)(1)) involved a deadly weapon.\nThe trial court found that it did, relying solely on \"a transcript\nfrom a preliminary hearing at which the victim testified that defendant\nhad used a knife during their altercation.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4\nCal.5th at p. 136.) This was error, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> explained: \"A\nsentencing court reviewing that preliminary [hearing] transcript has no\nway of knowing whether a jury would have credited the victim's\ntestimony had the case gone to trial. And at least in the absence of any\npertinent admissions, the sentencing court can only guess at whether, by\npleading guilty to a violation of [section 245(a)(1)], defendant was\nalso acknowledging the truth of the testimony indicating that she had\ncommitted the assault with a knife.\" (Gallardo, at p. 137.) In\nother words, the sentencing court's fact-finding was insufficiently\nreliable--not because a judge is less capable of sorting fact from\nfiction than would be a jury--but because vital information was missing:\nWould a jury in the prior case \"have credited\" the\nvictim's testimony about a knife? Did the defendant\n\"acknowledg[e] the truth\" of that particular testimony? Left\nto \"guess at\" the answers to these questions, the sentencing\ncourt could not reliably determine the dispositive fact. (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>Because the rule of Gallardo goes to the reliability of\nfact-finding at sentencing, I conclude it is retroactive to this case.\nThe three-part rule of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> would have us also consider the extent to\nwhich law enforcement has relied on pre-Gallardo law and, relatedly, the\ndisruptiveness inherent in applying the new rule retroactively, but\nthese factors \"are of significant relevance only when the question\nof retroactivity is a close one after the purpose of the new rule is\nconsidered.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 410.) And even if the\nquestion of retroactivity were a close one in light of Gallardo's\npurpose, I conclude these two factors do not weigh heavily against</p>\n\n<p>8</p>\n\n<p>retroactivity. The Attorney General does not even mention reliance\ninterests or the burden of disruption in arguing that Gallardo should\nnot be retroactively applied.</p>\n\n<p>I acknowledge that some number of defendants are serving time on\nfinal judgments that will be subject to challenge if Gallardo is\nretroactive. This group includes defendants whose sentences were\nenhanced for an out-of-state prior from a state that defines certain\ncrimes more broadly than does <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>, and defendants whose sentences\nwere enhanced for prior convictions under former section 245(a)(1). But\nwhen the <org>California Supreme Court</org> decided another case with a similar\npotential to disrupt final judgments, it easily determined its new rule\nwas retroactive. People v. Tenorio (1970) 3 Cal.3d 89, decided just two\nmonths before <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, invalidated on separation of powers grounds a\nstatute that prevented trial courts in narcotics cases from striking\nprior convictions except on motion of the district attorney. (Tenorio,\nat pp. 91, 95.) After deciding the merits of the challenge, the court\nadded in a footnote, \"[i]nasmuch as today's decision relates\nonly to sentencing and will not require any retrials, . . . it should\nenjoy fully retroactive effect.\" (Id. at p. 95, fn. 2.) By analogy\nhere, Gallardo relates only to sentencing, will not require any\nretrials, and by its own terms allows sentencing courts to consider only\nsuch documents as are already in the record on the prior conviction (and\nlikely in the record on the offense of conviction as well).</p>\n\n<p>The relative ease with which Gallardo may be retroactively applied\ncomes into stark relief when we consider the far more disruptive effect\nof a rule whose effects are not confined to sentencing. A sister court\ndeclined retroactively to apply the limits on expert testimony that our\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> set forth in People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 686\nbecause doing so</p>\n\n<p>9</p>\n\n<p>\"would be too disruptive and costly\" to the\nadministration of justice. (In re Thomas (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 744,\n766.) Retroactivity for Sanchez would require \"reopening thousands\nof cases in which the prosecution\" had reasonably relied on the\nprior rule, and in the ensuing years necessary evidence \"likely has\ngone stale.\" (Id. at pp. 766-767.) By contrast here, before\nGallardo the prosecution would have relied on paper records to prove\ncertain facts about a prior conviction. After Gallardo, the court may\nlook no further than those same paper records, or perhaps a subset of\nthem, to decide whether a sentencing enhancement is proper. Thus, the\nreliance of law enforcement on pre-Gallardo case law and the\ndisruptiveness inherent in retroactivity do not seem so extreme as to\ndeny Gallardo retroactive effect.</p>\n\n<p>The foregoing discussion comes with a significant caveat. I have\nassumed the parties are correct that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> is still good law. By 1989\nthe <org>United States Supreme Court</org> had moved decisively away from the\npurpose-based approach of Johnson,1 replacing it with an approach that\nasks first whether the legal rule in question was \"dictated by\nprecedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became\nfinal,\" or could properly be considered a \"new rule.\"\n(Teague, supra, 489 U.S. at p. 301, italics omitted.) Then, whether to\napply a new rule retroactively depends on whether defendant's\nconviction was final before the rule was announced and, if final,\nwhether the new rule was substantive or procedural. Rules that are not\nnew, or that are substantive, are fully retroactive; rules that are both\nnew and procedural are, with vanishingly few exceptions, retroactive\nonly to cases pending on direct</p>\n\n<p>1 Even in 1970, the <org>California Supreme Court's</org> approach to\nretroactivity appears to have been more generous in practice than the\nfederal approach. (Compare Mackey v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (1971) <location>401 U.S. 667</location>\n[two decisions excluding gambling tax returns as self-incriminating are\nnot retroactive] with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 416 [decision\nexcluding marijuana tax return as self-incriminating is retroactive].)</p>\n\n<p>10</p>\n\n<p>appeal.

For\nexample, without reference to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> or Teague our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> has\nheld that new rules that are substantive rather than procedural should\nbe applied retroactively, even to cases that are final for purposes of\nappeal. (See In re <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.marnez\">Martinez</location> (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1216, 1222-1223 [People v.\nChiu (2014) 59 Cal.4th 155, narrowing aider and abettor liability for\npremeditated homicide, is fully retroactive]; People v. Mutch (1971) 4\nCal.3d 389, 395-396 [finality is no bar to applying new kidnapping\nprecedent that construes \"a substantive definition of crime duly\npromulgated by the Legislature\"].)</p>\n\n<p><org>The California Supreme Court</org> has also applied Teague in a case\nwhere it knew that federal courts would have found retroactivity under\nTeague. The question in Gomez was whether Cunningham v. California\n(2007) <location>549 U.S. 270</location> was retroactive to cases that became final shortly\nbefore Cunningham was decided. (Gomez, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 653.) The\ncourt held that Cunningham was retroactive because, after Blakely v.\nWashington (2004) <location>542 U.S. 296</location>, the constitutional writing was on the\nwall, such that Cunningham could no longer be considered a truly new\nrule. (Gomez, at p. 660.) State courts should \"provide a remedy on\ncollateral review of a final judgment if that remedy would be available\nin the federal courts,\" and federal courts would have applied\nTeague to find Cunningham retroactive, our high court reasoned. (Gomez,\nat pp. 655-656.) The logic of Gomez renders Teague a sort of one-way\nratchet. Precedents that federal courts would find fully retroactive\nunder Teague apply retroactively in state court as well; precedents that\nunder Teague apply only on direct review may nonetheless be</p>\n\n<p>11</p>\n\n<p>fully retroactive in state court, under the purpose-based approach\nof <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>. (See Gomez, at p. 655, fn. 3.)</p>\n\n<p>With the intervening sea-change in federal law governing\nretroactivity, the <org>California Supreme Court</org> may decide the time has come\nto revisit <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, and it will soon have the opportunity to do so. (In\nre <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.milton\">Milton</location> (<chron>Apr. 17, 2020</chron>, S259954) ___Cal.5th___ [2020 Cal. LEXIS\n2736].) But as long as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> remains the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> approach to\nassessing retroactivity, I conclude Gallardo is fully retroactive.</p>\n\n<p>II.</p>\n\n<p>Although Gallardo applies to cases such as Haden's that were\nfinal before the <org>California Supreme Court</org> decided Gallardo, it turns out\nthe rule of Gallardo affords Haden no relief. Haden challenges here the\nsentencing court's determination that his two prior convictions for\nrobbery in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> count as serious felonies and therefore\n\"strikes\" under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California's</location> Three Strikes law. (Pen.\nCode, former SSSS 1197.2, subd. (c)(23), 1170.12.) Haden correctly\nargues that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> defines robbery broadly, sweeping in conduct\nthat is not a serious felony or a strike in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>. But as we will\nsee, the overbreadth Haden identifies is not dispositive because the\ncharging documents in both of his <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> cases show that Haden\npleaded guilty to conduct falling squarely within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California's</location>\ndefinition of a serious felony and a strike.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> defines robbery to include threatening or inflicting\nbodily injury \"in the course of committing a theft,\" even\nduring an unsuccessful attempt to commit theft. (<person>N.D. Cent</person>. Code, SS\n12.1-22-01.) \"It is therefore, possible under [<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota's</location>]\nstatute to commit robbery without committing theft.\" (State v.\nMcKing (N.D. 1999) 593 N.W.2d 342, 344.) Not so in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>, where the\ncrime of robbery requires a completed theft. (See</p>\n\n<p>12</p>\n\n<p>e.g., People v. Gomez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 249, 254.) Because North\nDakota broadly defines robbery, it is not enough to establish the\nalleged priors that Haden was twice convicted of that crime. The\nAttorney General concedes that \"a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> robbery without a\n[completed] theft would not qualify as a serious felony or strike in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, the charging documents and judgments in Haden's <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North\nDakota</location> cases show that in both robberies Haden completed his thefts. The\nsentencing court had before it two criminal informations. One alleged\nHaden \"committed the crime of Robbery, committed as follows: . . .\nhe took <money>$88.00</money> from another while threatening him with a dangerous\nweapon, a butcher knife.\" The other alleged Haden \"committed\nthe crime of Robbery, committed as follows: . . . he took property from\nanother while threatening him with a dangerous weapon, a butcher\nknife.\" Both charging documents specifically allege that Haden\n\"took,\"--that is, completed the theft of--the property in\nquestion. The informations do not charge, nor were they amended to\nstate, that Haden merely attempted to take money or property from\nanother. In both cases, the criminal judgments state Haden was convicted\nby guilty plea of \"robbery as charged in the Information.\"</p>\n\n<p>Gallardo allows a sentencing court to determine, \"based on the\nrecord of the prior plea proceedings, that defendant's guilty plea\nencompassed a relevant admission about the nature of [his] crime.\"\n(Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 139.) The records in Haden's\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> plea proceedings establish that Haden indeed made relevant\nadmissions. By pleading guilty \"as charged in the\nInformation,\" Haden admitted that both robberies involved\ncompleted, not just attempted, thefts. Haden admitted he\n\"took\" money and property by threatening his victims with a\nknife. His prior convictions are, accordingly, serious felonies and\nstrikes under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> law.</p>\n\n<p>13</p>\n\n<p>Haden disputes this application of Gallardo, arguing that here the\nsentencing court should not have looked beyond the elements of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North\nDakota</location> statute to which Haden pleaded guilty. He argues that the Sixth\nAmendment only allows Gallardo's limited record review where a\nconviction was obtained under a divisible statute, which is a statute\nthat includes alternative elements, and that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota's</location> robbery\nstatute is indivisible. The problem with this argument is that Gallardo\nitself rejects it. Gallardo does discuss two <org>United States Supreme Court</org>\ncases construing the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\")--cases\nin which the difference between divisible and indivisible statutes is\nimportant. (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 132-133 [discussing\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (2013) <location>570 U.S. 254</location>, and Mathis v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United\nStates</location> (2016) ___<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>___ [136 S.Ct. 2243].) But Gallardo cautions\nagainst confusing statutory construction with constitutional mandate:\n\"[T]he high court did not hold that the Sixth Amendment, as opposed\nto the federal ACCA, forbids\" the court from conducting a limited\nrecord review \"when the statute of conviction has a single,\n'indivisible' set of elements (<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>) or when it sets out\nalternative means, rather than alternative elements constituting the\nsame crime (Mathis).\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 134-135.)\nBecause the federal ACCA plays no part in this case, the distinction\nthat <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> and Mathis draw between divisible and indivisible statutes\nis of no moment. The Sixth Amendment does not require sentencing courts\nto distinguish divisible from indivisible statutes, and Gallardo does\nnot import this distinction into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> law. Gallardo is, for\nexample, completely silent on whether former section 245(a)(1) sets\nforth alternative elements or alternative means, defining a divisible or\nan indivisible crime. This silence confirms that Gallardo's limited\nrecord review is proper for priors obtained under either a divisible or\nan indivisible statute.</p>\n\n<p>14</p>\n\n<p>In sum, I conclude Gallardo is fully retroactive, but it affords\nHaden no relief. I therefore join the majority in denying the petition\nfor habeas corpus.</p>\n\n<p>TUCHER, J.</p>\n\n<p>1</p>\n\n<p>BROWN, J., Concurring.</p>\n\n<p>I fully join the lead opinion, and I write separately only to\nexplain certain points of disagreement with the thoughtful analysis in\n<person>Justice Tucher's</person> concurring opinion.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the concurrence places a significant amount of weight\non portions of People v. Gallardo (2017) 4 Cal.5th 120 (Gallardo) in\nwhich the Court did not purport to address the purpose of its holding,\nfor the simple reason that it had no need to. Citing certain parts of\nGallardo, <person>Justice Tucher</person> deduces that the <org>Supreme Court's</org> ruling\nwas motivated by an unspoken purpose to promote reliability. (Conc. opn.\nante, at pp. 5-6.) Impressed though I am with its eloquence, I am\nunconvinced by the concurrence's approach.</p>\n\n<p>First, the Court in Gallardo did not \"make[] clear that its\nnew rule is squarely aimed at the reliability of fact-finding.\"\n(Conc. opn. ante, at p. 6.) Indeed, the word \"reliability\" and\nits cognates appear nowhere in the majority opinion; it seems likely\nthat if the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> had wished to \"make clear\" that the\npurpose of its holding was reliability, it could and would have done so.\nIn my view, Gallardo is instead focused upon no more or less than\nprotecting the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial, as first embraced by\nthe <org>United States Supreme Court</org> in Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) <location>530\nU.S. 466</location> (Apprendi) and as more fully expounded upon in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> v.\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (2013) <location>570 U.S. 254</location> (<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>) and Mathis v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>\n(2016) 579 U.S. ___ [136 S.Ct. 2443] (Mathis). (Gallardo, 4 Cal.5th at\npp. 124-125.) Following the high court's elucidation of Sixth\nAmendment principles in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> and Mathis, our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> held that\n\"the trial court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\na jury trial\" when it reviewed a preliminary hearing transcript to\nassess whether</p>\n\n<p>2</p>\n\n<p>the prior conviction qualified as a serious felony. (Ibid.) The\nGallardo Court cited Apprendi in explaining that \"when the\nsentencing court must rely on a finding regarding the defendant's\nconduct, but the jury did not necessarily make that finding (or the\ndefendant did not admit to that fact), the defendant's Sixth\nAmendment rights are violated. (See Apprendi, supra, 530 U.S. at p.\n490.)\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 135.) The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>\nfounded its reasoning upon <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps'</org> \"considered and\nunequivocal\" statement that \"[t]he jury trial right is\nviolated when a court adds extra punishment based on factfinding that\ngoes 'beyond merely identifying a prior conviction' by\n'try[ing] to discern what a trial showed, or a plea proceeding\nrevealed, about the defendant's underlying conduct.'\n(<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>, supra, 540 U.S. at p. 269.)\" (Gallardo, at p. 135.)\nThus, Gallardo's laser focus was on vindication of the jury trial\nright, without a further nod to any underlying motivation relating to\nreliability.</p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding the absence of the word \"reliability\"\nfrom Gallardo itself, <person>Justice Tucher's</person> concurrence infers a tacit\npurpose to promote reliability in the majority's rejection of a\njury trial remedy. The concurrence quotes Gallardo as follows:\n\"[S]uch a proceeding--in which a jury would be impaneled for the\nsole purpose of reading the preliminary hearing transcript in\ndefendant's prior assault case--would raise significant\nconstitutional concerns,' said the court.\" (Conc. opn. ante,\nat p. 5.) Missing from that quotation, however, are the final two words\nof the quoted sentence from Gallardo. The full quotation from Gallardo\nreads as follows: \" '[S]uch a proceeding--in which a jury\nwould be impaneled for the sole purpose of reading the preliminary\nhearing transcript in defendant's prior assault case--would raise\nsignificant constitutional concerns under Apprendi.\" (Gallardo,\nsupra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 138, underlining added.) Those two omitted</p>\n\n<p>3</p>\n\n<p>words are important because, as the lead opinion correctly notes,\nthe <org>United States Supreme Court</org> has squarely held that cases protecting\nthe Sixth Amendment jury trial right are not retroactive because the\nCourt \"[could] not confidently say\" that the judicial\nfactfinding prohibited by Apprendi \"seriously diminishes\naccuracy.\" (Schriro v. Summerlin (2004) <location>542 U.S. 348</location>, 356\n(Schriro).) In Schriro, the Court refused to give retroactive effect to\nRing v. Arizona (2002) <location>536 U.S. 584</location> (Ring), which had extended to\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.az\">Arizona's</location> death penalty scheme the Apprendi rule requiring a jury\nfinding on any fact that would increase a penalty beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum \" '[o]ther than the fact of a prior\nconviction.' \" (Schriro, at pp. 350-351; see also DeStefano v.\nWoods (1968) <location>392 U.S. 631</location>, 633-634 (DeStefano) [cases extending Sixth\nAmendment jury trial right to states not retroactive].)</p>\n\n<p>Schriro was decided under the Teague v. Lane (1989) <location>489 U.S. 288</location>\n(Teague) standard for retroactivity, and <person>Justice Tucher's</person>\nconcurrence correctly notes that the Teague retroactivity analysis is\nfashioned somewhat differently than the pre-<org>Teague United States Supreme\nCourt</org> standards adopted by our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> in In re <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> (1970) 3\nCal.3d 404 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>).

In Johnson, our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> held that\nthe first factor in the retroactivity analysis is the \" '\n\"purpose to be served by the new standards,\" ' \" and\nexplained that under <org>United States Supreme Court</org> precedent,\n\"[f]ully retroactive decisions are seen as vindicating a right\nwhich is essential to a reliable determination of whether an accused\nshould suffer a penal sanction.\" (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, at pp. 410-411.) Under\nthe Teague formulation, procedural rules given retroactive effect are\nthose \"without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is\nseriously diminished.\" (Schriro, supra,</p>\n\n<p>4</p>\n\n<p>542 U.S. at p. 352, first italics added; see also Whorton v.\nBockting (2007) <location>549 U.S. 406</location>, 418 (Whorton) [for a procedural rule to be\nretroactive, it must first be \"necessary to prevent 'an \"\n'impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction,' \"\n' \" italics added].) The first factor of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> test and\nthe first prong of the Teague retroactivity test for procedural rules\nare thus ultimately not so distinct, as they are both centered on the\nreliability, or accuracy, of convictions.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, in deciding Schriro, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>\nspecifically found its decision in DeStefano--which was \"decided\nunder [the] pre-Teague retroactivity framework\"--to be \"on\npoint\" and \"germane\" to its analysis of whether to give\nretroactive effect to Ring (and, by extension, Apprendi). (Schriro,\nsupra, 542 U.S. at pp. 356-357.) As noted above, the \"pre-Teague\nretroactivity framework\" referred to in Schriro is precisely the\nthree-factor test adopted in 1970 by our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:JNJ\">Johnson.\n(Johnson</org>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 410.) In DeStefano, after citing the\nsame three-factor test later adopted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>\nrefused to give retroactive effect to Duncan v. Louisiana (1968) <location>391\nU.S. 145</location> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.az.duncan\">Duncan</location>), which applied the Sixth Amendment's jury trial\nguarantee to the states. (DeStefano, supra, 392 U.S. at pp. 633-634\n[\"[a]ll three factors favor only prospective application of the\nrule\" in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.az.duncan\">Duncan</location>, as the Court would not assert \" 'that\nevery criminal trial--or any particular trial--held before a judge alone\nis unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge\nas he would be by a jury' \"].) Because the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> in\nSchriro followed its own \"on point\" pre-Teague jurisprudence\nin DeStefano, Schriro's refusal to grant retroactive effect to Ring\nand Apprendi sheds significant light on how <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> applies to Gallardo,\nwhich rests on the same Sixth Amendment jury trial right as discussed in\nSchriro and DeStefano. Put another way, that</p>\n\n<p>5</p>\n\n<p>Schriro was decided under the Teague standard for retroactivity\ndoes not mean we can disregard it in assessing the question of how we\nshould apply <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location> here. Quite to the contrary, as Schriro's\nembrace of DeStefano shows.</p>\n\n<p>In continuing with the theme of reliability, <person>Justice Tucher's</person>\nconcurrence asks, \"How better to determine the purpose of a new\nconstitutional rule than to examine what remedy the new rule\nrequires?\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 6.) But as the concurrence\nitself points out, the remedy fashioned in Gallardo--whereby a trial\ncourt determines which facts were necessarily found or admitted in a\nprior proceeding--was intended to address not only the Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial, but also the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy\ntrial and the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double\njeopardy. (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 138.) One cannot\nrealistically divine a single unspoken \"purpose\" of Gallardo\nby looking at a remedy that had to accommodate multiple constitutional\nmandates. In any event, even if one focuses solely on the remedy, it is\nevident that the remedy is directed at correcting violations of the\nright to a jury determination of a sentence-enhancing fact. A trial\ncourt applying Gallardo must assess what facts a jury necessarily found,\nor what facts a defendant admitted after waiving the right to a jury\ndetermination as part of a plea.</p>\n\n<p>In finding a \"much broader purpose at work\" (conc. opn.\nante, at p. 6.), <person>Justice Tucher's</person> concurrence hones in on the Sixth\nAmendment's confrontation clause by quoting Gallardo's\nstatement that facts used to increase a sentence must be proved at a\njury trial with all \" 'the procedural safeguards, such as the\nSixth Amendment right to cross-examine one's accusers, that\nnormally apply in criminal proceedings.' \" (Conc. opn. ante,\nat p. 6, quoting Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 138-139.) The\nconcurrence,</p>\n\n<p>6</p>\n\n<p>however, fails to recognize that the <org>United States Supreme Court</org>\nhas determined that Crawford v. Washington (2004) <location>541 U.S. 36</location>--its most\nsignificant confrontation clause case this century--is not retroactive\nto cases final on appeal. (See Whorton, supra, <location>549 U.S. 406</location>.) Applying\nTeague, the Court believed that the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.crford\">Crawford</location> rule, which curtailed the\nuse of \"testimonial\" hearsay, was not one \" '\n\"without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is\nseriously diminished.\" ' \" (Id. at p. 420.) Contrasting\nthe <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.crford\">Crawford</location> rule with the right to counsel recognized in Gideon v.\nWainwright (1963) <location>372 U.S. 335</location>, the Court explained: \"The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.crford\">Crawford</location>\nrule is much more limited in scope, and the relationship of that rule to\nthe accuracy of the factfinding process is far less direct and\nprofound.\" (Whorton, at p. 419, italics added.)</p>\n\n<p>It is true, as <person>Justice Tucher's</person> concurrence explains, that\nunder the pre-Teague standard, the <org>United States Supreme Court</org> gave\nretroactive effect to rules relating to a defendant's right to\nconfront witnesses. But review of those cases reveals they involved a\nright with a far stronger connection to a reliable determination of\nguilt or innocence than did Gallardo. In Roberts v. Russell (1968) <location>392\nU.S. 293</location> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.robrts\">Roberts</location>) the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> gave retroactive effect to Bruton\nv. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (1968) <location>391 U.S. 123</location>, a landmark confrontation clause\ndecision that precluded the admission of a nontestifying\ndefendant's confession that implicated a codefendant. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.robrts\">Roberts</location>, at\np. 295.) In Berger v. California (1969) <location>393 U.S. 314</location> (Berger), the Court\ngave retroactive effect to Barber v. Page (1968) <location>390 U.S. 719</location>, where the\nCourt held that the confrontation clause prohibits the introduction of a\nwitness's preliminary hearing testimony unless the prosecution has\nmade a good faith effort to secure the witness's presence at trial.\n(Berger, at p. 315.)</p>\n\n<p>7</p>\n\n<p>The rules in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.robrts\">Roberts</location> and Berger thus remedied a situation where a\ndefendant clearly lacked any ability to confront a witness at trial.\nWith Gallardo, by contrast, we can only speculate whether the denial of\nthe right to have a jury decide a sentence-enhancing fact also resulted\nin the denial of a defendant's separate and distinct right to\nconfront witnesses about that fact. And if one does engage in such\nspeculation, there are many situations in which a defendant will have\nreceived a sentencing enhancement without any confrontation clause\ninfirmity. Haden's case is illustrative, as he admitted the\nsentence-enhancing fact of taking property (and therefore committing a\ntheft) when pleading guilty to robbery in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location>. This admission\neliminates any concern that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to\nconfront a witness about completing the theft. Even for a defendant who\nproceeds to trial under a robbery statute like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota's</location>, any\nconcern that the defendant was denied the right to confront witnesses\nabout completing a theft is minimal. Notably, a defendant charged with\nrobbery in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nd\">North Dakota</location> would be incentivized to cross-examine witnesses\nabout whether he completed a theft if it truly was a contested issue, as\ncompletion of the theft would be probative of whether the defendant\nintended to commit a robbery, as distinguished from mere assault or\nbattery. In other cases, a defendant might never challenge whether a\ntheft was completed if, for example, the completion was undisputed and\nhis defense at trial was misidentification, as presented through alibi\nwitnesses. What these examples (and many others) demonstrate is that,\nunlike the rights at issue in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.rusell\">Russell</location> and Berger, the jury trial right\nvindicated in Gallardo is not necessarily tethered to a defendant's\nseparate right confront witnesses. Rather, the right upheld in Gallardo\nis \"collateral to or relatively far removed</p>\n\n<p>8</p>\n\n<p>from the reliability of the fact-finding process at trial.\"\n(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.johson\">Johnson</location>, supra, 3 Cal.3d at pp. 411-412.)</p>\n\n<p>The concurrence also infers a purpose to promote reliability from\nGallardo's discussion of the trial court's use of a\npreliminary hearing transcript to determine whether the prior conviction\ninvolved a deadly weapon. In quoting snippets from Gallardo, <person>Justice\nTucher's</person> concurrence states: \"In other words, the sentencing\ncourt's fact-finding was insufficiently reliable--not because a\njudge is less capable of sorting fact from fiction than would be a\njury--but because vital information was missing: Would a jury in the\nprior case 'have credited' the victim's testimony about a\nknife? Did the defendant 'acknowledg[e] the truth' of that\nparticular testimony? Left to 'guess at' the answers to these\nquestions, the sentencing court could not reliably determine the\ndispositive fact.\" (Conc. opn. ante, at p. 7.) But the portion of\nGallardo quoted by the concurrence says nothing about the reliability of\njudicial fact-finding. Instead, the Court's focus is on the\nidentity of the fact-finder (or fact-admitter). A full quotation of the\nrelevant portion of Gallardo makes clear this core concern: \"The\nCourt of Appeal concluded this [review of the preliminary hearing\ntranscript] was permissible under <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> because that decision allows\ntrial courts to 'consult \"a limited class of documents, such\nas indictments and jury instructions,\" ' in order to identify\nwhich elements of the statute 'formed the basis of the prior\nconviction.' Because 'nothing in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org> excludes the\npreliminary hearing transcript from that class of documents,' the\ncourt concluded that the sentencing court properly used the transcript\nto determine that defendant's conviction was based on assault with\na deadly weapon and thus qualified as a serious felony within the\nmeaning of the Three Strikes law. [PP] While Descamps does permit courts\nto rely on certain documents to identify the precise statutory basis for</p>\n\n<p>9</p>\n\n<p>a prior conviction, the documents listed in\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>--'indictments and jury instructions' (<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3535260458\">Descamps</org>,\nsupra, 570 U.S. at p. 287)--differ from the preliminary hearing\ntranscript here in a meaningful way. An indictment or jury instructions\nmight help identify what facts a jury necessarily found in the prior\nproceeding. (See Shepard[ v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location> (2005)] 544 U.S. [13,]\n20-21.) But defendant's preliminary hearing transcript can reveal\nno such thing. A sentencing court reviewing that preliminary transcript\nhas no way of knowing whether a jury would have credited the\nvictim's testimony had the case gone to trial. And at least in the\nabsence of any pertinent admissions, the sentencing court can only guess\nat whether, by pleading guilty to a violation of Penal Code section 245,\nsubd. (a)(1), defendant was also acknowledging the truth of the\ntestimony indicating that she had committed the assault with a\nknife.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at pp. 136-137, italics added.)\nWhen this portion of Gallardo is read in its full context, therefore, it\nbecomes apparent that the problem identified by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> with\nthe use of the preliminary hearing transcript was not that it was an\nunreliable method for determining what happened, as the concurrence\nseems to suggest; the problem with using the preliminary hearing\ntranscript is that it reveals nothing about what a jury necessarily\nfound or the defendant necessarily admitted, as required to protect a\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment jury trial right.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <person>Justice Tucher's</person> concurrence may understate the\ndisruptive effect of applying Gallardo retroactively to final\nconvictions. The concurrence believes that Gallardo can be applied\nretroactively to final cases with \"relative ease\" because it\nrelates \"only to sentencing, will not require any retrials, and by\nits own terms allows sentencing courts to consider only such documents\nas are already in the record on the prior conviction (and likely in</p>\n\n<p>10</p>\n\n<p>the record on the offense of conviction as well).\" (Conc. opn.\nante, at p. 8.) It is not at all clear, however, that a\nGallardo-compliant procedure can be undertaken with \"relative\nease.\" A record of conviction oftentimes will lack critical\ndocuments that would show whether defendant's guilty plea\n\"encompassed a relevant admission about the nature of her\ncrime.\" (Gallardo, supra, 4 Cal.5th at p. 139.) This includes a\ntranscript of a defendant's plea colloquy which, unlike a\npreliminary hearing transcript, may often not be requested by a\nprosecutor or defendant, as neither party would need it for ongoing\nproceedings in run-of-the-mill cases resolved by plea. (Cf. Pen. Code,\nSS 869, subd. (e) [requiring court reporter to create transcript of\npreliminary hearing within 10 days in any felony case in which a\ndefendant is held to answer, or upon request of either party in all\nother cases].) Retroactive application of Gallardo could force\nprosecutors to go on a scavenger hunt of sorts where they would have to\naugment a record by tracking down old court files and personnel--no easy\ntask for convictions, such as Haden's, that occurred decades ago in\nother jurisdictions.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, I must respectfully disagree with <person>Justice\nTucher's</person> view as to whether Gallardo is retroactive, although I\nagree that even if it were, Haden would not be entitled to relief.</p>\n\n<p>BROWN, J.</p>\n\n<p>1</p>\n\n<p>Trial court:</p>\n\n<p><org>San Mateo County Superior Court</org></p>\n\n<p>Trial judge:</p>\n\n<p>Honorable <person>Carl W.
