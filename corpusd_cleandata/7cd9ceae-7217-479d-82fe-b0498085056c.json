    "text": "Trenton: Morris Township in New Jersey has issued the following news release:\n\nThe Morris Township Committee is deeply saddened by the brutal killing of\nGeorge Floyd. We recognize that Mr. Floyd is one of many black men and women\nwho have died under similar circumstances. We honor their memory and mourn\ntheir deaths as well.\n\nWe feel compelled to add our voices to recognize the hurt, anguish, and\noutrage being felt in our community and across our country. We stand in\nsolidarity with our fellow Americans as we all seek a more just, more equal,\nand more compassionate society. We reaffirm our commitment to promoting\nequality, inclusiveness, trust, and mutual respect within our community.\n\nWe laud those exercising their rights to demonstrate peacefully in public, as\ndemonstrated by the recent procession and vigil held here in Morris Township.\nWe deplore the violent protest seen elsewhere as detrimental to this moment\nand to our society.\n\nThe Township Committee also stands with our Morris Township Police Department\n(MTPD). We are proud of our Department's recruitment of diverse talent and its\ncommitment to the principles of community policing. This commitment is\naffirmed by MTPD's participation in a rigorous accreditation program which\nemphasizes continuous best-practice training in such areas as use of force,\nde-escalation techniques, racial profiling, harassment, ethics, community\noutreach, and dealing with mental illness and substance abuse.\n\nAs a community we cannot stand idly by. As government leaders, we have an\nobligation to combat racism, prejudice, hatred, and injustice in all forms. We\nknow there is much work still to do to accomplish needed changes. We are\ncommitted to support ongoing listening and dialogue to help build awareness,\ninsight, understanding, and trust among our diverse racial and ethnic groups,\nfaith leaders, community leaders, law enforcement and government officials. We\nremain steadfast in our commitment to transparency and keeping the lines of\ncommunication open to all.\n\nWe also recognize that words must be followed by actions. We are committed to\nboth.\n\nThis moment calls us to remember a common phrase that has come up repeatedly\nover our country's history: \"United we stand. Divided we fall.\" Let us stand\ntogether both as a community and a Nation to ensure that the legacy of George\nFloyd (and others) is to strengthen our unity, build our mutual understanding\nand respect, and produce actions that lead to positive and enduring change for\nall.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location>: <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.morhip\">Morris Township</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> has issued the following\nnews release:</p>\n\n<p>The Morris Township Committee is deeply saddened by the brutal\nkilling of <person>George Floyd</person>. We recognize that <person>Mr. Floyd</person> is one of many\nblack men and women who have died under similar circumstances. We honor\ntheir memory and mourn their deaths as well.</p>\n\n<p>We feel compelled to add our voices to recognize the hurt, anguish,\nand outrage being felt in our community and across our country. We stand\nin solidarity with our fellow Americans as we all seek a more just, more\nequal, and more compassionate society. We reaffirm our commitment to\npromoting equality, inclusiveness, trust, and mutual respect within our\ncommunity.</p>\n\n<p>We laud those exercising their rights to demonstrate peacefully in\npublic, as demonstrated by the recent procession and vigil held here in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.morhip\">Morris Township</location>. We deplore the violent protest seen elsewhere as\ndetrimental to this moment and to our society.</p>\n\n<p>The Township Committee also stands with our <org>Morris Township Police\nDepartment</org> (MTPD). We are proud of our Department's recruitment of\ndiverse talent and its commitment to the principles of community\npolicing. This commitment is affirmed by MTPD's participation in a\nrigorous accreditation program which emphasizes continuous best-practice\ntraining in such areas as use of force, de-escalation techniques, racial\nprofiling, harassment, ethics, community outreach, and dealing with\nmental illness and substance abuse.</p>\n\n<p>As a community we cannot stand idly by. As government leaders, we\nhave an obligation to combat racism, prejudice, hatred, and injustice in\nall forms. We know there is much work still to do to accomplish needed\nchanges. We are committed to support ongoing listening and dialogue to\nhelp build awareness, insight, understanding, and trust among our\ndiverse racial and ethnic groups, faith leaders, community leaders, law\nenforcement and government officials. We remain steadfast in our\ncommitment to transparency and keeping the lines of communication open\nto all.</p>\n\n<p>We also recognize that words must be followed by actions. We are\ncommitted to both.</p>\n\n<p>This moment calls us to remember a common phrase that has come up\nrepeatedly over our country's history: \"United we stand.\nDivided we fall.\" Let us stand together both as a community and a\nNation to ensure that the legacy of <person>George Floyd</person> (and others) is to\nstrengthen our unity, build our mutual understanding and respect, and\nproduce actions that lead to positive and enduring change for all.</p>",
