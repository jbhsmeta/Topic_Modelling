    "text": "FRANKFORT, Ky. \\- During a Second Amendment rally in Frankfort on Sunday, an\neffigy of Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear was hung from a tree.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, at least 100 people were gathered for the\nrally at the state capitol from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\nThe newspaper reports that the event turned into a protest of the COVID-19\nrestrictions ordered by Gov. Beshear, as protesters moved from the capitol\nbuilding to the governor's mansion. People were reportedly chanting, \"Come\nout, Andy.\"\n\nLate Sunday afternoon, photos began to circulate of Gov. Beshear being hung in\neffigy. A Courier Journal reporter tweeted out several images.\n\nFreelance photographer Gerry Seavo James recorded it live on Facebook:\n\nWLEX spoke to James, who was at the protest and witnessed it. He says a\nprotest organizer brought it out of his trunk and hung it up.\n\n\"Immediately as I saw that go up, as an African America there's this imagery\nof generational trauma, and you think of lynching and images gathered around\ngetting lynched as entertainment, that image clicked in my head when I saw\nthat,\" Seavo said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have taken to social media to condemn the act. Joni Jenkins,\nthe State Representative House Democrat Floor Leader, said \"it was a terrible,\nterrible act, but I don't think it is representative of what Kentucky is. I\nthink most Kentuckians know that we are in this together.\"\n\nThe House Democratic leadership released this statement:\n\nSpeaker Davis Osborne released this statement on behalf of the House Majority\nCaucus:\n\nSenate Major Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted this statement:\n\nWe'll continue to update this story with any new developments.\n\nThis story was originally published by Kylen Mills at WLEX.",

Beshear</person>, as protesters moved from the capitol building to the governor's mansion. People were reportedly chanting, \"Come out, Andy.\"</p>\n\n<p>Late Sunday afternoon, photos began to circulate of <person>Gov. Beshear</person> being hung in effigy. A <org>Courier Journal</org> reporter tweeted out several images.</p>\n\n<p>Freelance photographer Gerry Seavo James recorded it live on Facebook:</p>\n\n<p>WLEX spoke to James, who was at the protest and witnessed it. He says a protest organizer brought it out of his trunk and hung it up.</p>\n\n<p>\"Immediately as I saw that go up, as an African America there's this imagery of generational trauma, and you think of lynching and images gathered around getting lynched as entertainment, that image clicked in my head when I saw that,\" Seavo said.</p>\n\n<p>Several lawmakers have taken to social media to condemn the act. <person>Joni Jenkins</person>, the State Representative House Democrat Floor Leader, said \"it was a terrible, terrible act, but I don't think it is representative of what <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Kentucky</location> is. I think most Kentuckians know that we are in this together.\"</p>\n\n<p>The House Democratic leadership released this statement:</p>\n\n<p>Speaker <person>Davis Osborne</person> released this statement on behalf of the <org>House Majority Caucus</org>:</p>\n\n<p>Senate Major Leader <person>Mitch McConnell</person> tweeted this statement:</p>\n\n<p>We'll continue to update this story with any new developments.</p>\n\n<p>This story was originally published by <person>Kylen Mills</person> at WLEX.</p>",
