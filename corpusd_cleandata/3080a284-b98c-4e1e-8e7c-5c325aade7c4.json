    "text": "Jun. 5\\--MLB Network embarks on a series Monday in which hosts Bob Costas and\nTom Verducci look back at some of the biggest moments of legendary baseball\nannouncers.\n\nFour editions of \"The Sounds of Baseball\" are in the works. The Dodgers' Vin\nScully is the subject of the opener, set for 7 p.m. Monday. The next three are\non broadcasters with significant St. Louis ties. Two were iconic Cardinals\nannouncers, Jack Buck and Harry Caray. The other, Milwaukee's Bob Uecker, was\na backup catcher on the Cards' 1964 World Series championship team. Air dates\nfor those productions, which have not been finished, have not been set.\n\nCostas said he and Verducci have \"submitted a long list of moments (from the\nsubjects' careers) to the producers, who will get what they can -- probably\n90%\" of what is requested. \"Then we'll individualize the pieces.\"\n\nCostas said the idea is to humanize the broadcasters rather than just run a\nreel of big or memorable calls. To that end, viewers can expect to hear\npersonal stories and anecdotes about the subjects as told by the hosts.\n\nWith Buck, Costas said the plan is to showcase his \"wit, his sentimental side\nand how he treated people he encountered.\" Likely to be included is the story\nof the time Buck invited a 13-year-old boy who was having a tough time with\ncystic fibrosis into the broadcast booth.\n\nWhile the youngster was there, a foul ball hit a wire holding up the screen\nbehind home plate and changed course. The ball not only went into the booth,\nit hit a cardboard box that was near the boy's father then rolled to a stop in\nfront of the boy. Buck described the special scene in his autobiography,\n\"That's a Winner,\" which was published in 1997.\n\n\"He picked it up, and his eyes were like saucers,\" Buck wrote. \". . . In my 31\nyears at Busch Stadium, that's the only ball that ever landed in the back row\nof our broadcast booth. Never before, and not since. That ball was delivered .\n. . by you know who.\"\n\nThe Scully series opener is to be shown 52 years to the day after he called\nthe Dodgers' Don Drysdale breaking Walter Johnson's consecutive scoreless\ninnings streak. Scully also was the lead television network baseball announcer\nfor many years, with NBC, and thus a variety of the calls included in the show\nhit on some of the sport's biggest moments -- Don Larsen's perfect game in the\n1956 World Series and Hank Aaron's 715th home run, in 1974, to break Babe\nRuth's hallowed career record.\n\nIn conjunction with that program, earlier Monday MLB Network is to show\ncondensed versions of three memorable games Scully called. Two are no-hitters,\nby Hideo Nomo (11 a.m) and Clayton Kershaw (3 p.m.).\n\nThe other contest, at 1 o'clock, is of particular interest to Cardinals fans\n--Game 6 of the 1985 National League Championship Series, in which Jack\nClark's three-run homer in the top of the ninth inning was the key cog in\nvaulting the Redbirds into the World Series. They trailed 5-4, with two out,\nwhen Clark stepped to the plate. Then Ken Dayley retired the Dodgers in order\nin the bottom of the inning to ignite the celebration.\n\nREMEMBERING 'UNCLE WES:' The death this week of pro basketball Hall of Famer\nWes Unseld was particularity hard on St. Louis University men's basketball\nradio analyst and St. Louis American sports editor Earl Austin Jr.\n\nUnseld was his uncle.\n\nAustin could not be reached, but shared some of his memories in an article for\nthe American.\n\n\"To most, he will be remembered as one of the greatest players in the history\nof the National Basketball Association. . . . To me, he was simply Uncle Wes .\n. . the younger brother of my late mother Sandra Austin,\" he wrote.\n\nUnseld was a powerful center with the Baltimore-Capital-Washington Bullets\n(now the Washington Wizards) who led the franchise to its only NBA title, in\n1978.\n\nAustin played basketball while in school and emulated his famous relative.\n\n\"When I got to college at Lindenwood University, I wore his No. 41 with great\npride,\" Austin wrote. \"The biggest compliment I would always get was when\npeople would tell me I played like Wes Unseld without knowing our family\nconnection.\"\n\nThe recollections are special.\n\n\"Most of all, I will remember Uncle Wes as just being a cool dude to be\naround. . . . He was a down to earth man with a great sense of humor,\" Austin\nwrote. \"If you didn't know him, you would have never thought that he was this\nNBA legend. He never talked about it. He was a quiet man who exhibited great\ncharacter and strength in everything he did.\n\n\"Uncle Wes never needed to talk about his basketball greatness. He had a proud\nnephew in St. Louis to do it for him.\n\n\"Rest well Uncle Wes. You were a great player and a great man.\"\n\n___\n\n(c)2020 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "MLB Network to highlight iconic Cardinals announcers Buck, Caray [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]",
    "html": "<p><chron>Jun. 5</chron>--MLB Network embarks on a series Monday in which hosts <person>Bob Costas</person> and <person>Tom Verducci</person> look back at some of the biggest moments of legendary baseball announcers.</p>\n<p>Four editions of \"The Sounds of Baseball\" are in the works. The <org>Dodgers'</org> <person>Vin Scully</person> is the subject of the opener, set for <chron>7 p.m. Monday</chron>. The next three are on broadcasters with significant St. Louis ties. Two were iconic Cardinals announcers, <person>Jack Buck</person> and <person>Harry Caray</person>. The other, Milwaukee's <person>Bob Uecker</person>, was a backup catcher on the Cards' 1964 World Series championship team. Air dates for those productions, which have not been finished, have not been set.</p>\n<p>Costas said he and Verducci have \"submitted a long list of moments (from the subjects' careers) to the producers, who will get what they can -- probably 90%\" of what is requested. \"Then we'll individualize the pieces.\"</p>\n<p>Costas said the idea is to humanize the broadcasters rather than just run a reel of big or memorable calls. To that end, viewers can expect to hear personal stories and anecdotes about the subjects as told by the hosts.</p>\n<p>With Buck, Costas said the plan is to showcase his \"wit, his sentimental side and how he treated people he encountered.\" Likely to be included is the story of the time Buck invited a 13-year-old boy who was having a tough time with cystic fibrosis into the broadcast booth.</p>\n<p>While the youngster was there, a foul ball hit a wire holding up the screen behind home plate and changed course. The ball not only went into the booth, it hit a cardboard box that was near the boy's father then rolled to a stop in front of the boy. Buck described the special scene in his autobiography, \"That's a Winner,\" which was published in 1997.</p>\n<p>\"He picked it up, and his eyes were like saucers,\" Buck wrote. \". . . In my 31 years at <location>Busch Stadium</location>, that's the only ball that ever landed in the back row of our broadcast booth. Never before, and not since. That ball was delivered . . . by you know who.\"</p>\n<p>The Scully series opener is to be shown 52 years to the day after he called the <org>Dodgers'</org> <person>Don Drysdale</person> breaking <person>Walter Johnson's</person> consecutive scoreless innings streak. Scully also was the lead television network baseball announcer for many years, with <org>NBC</org>, and thus a variety of the calls included in the show hit on some of the sport's biggest moments -- <person>Don Larsen's</person> perfect game in the 1956 World Series and <person>Hank Aaron's</person> 715th home run, in 1974, to break <person>Babe Ruth's</person> hallowed career record.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with that program, earlier Monday MLB Network is to show condensed versions of three memorable games Scully called. Two are no-hitters, by <person>Hideo Nomo</person> (11 a.m) and <person>Clayton Kershaw</person> (<chron>3 p.m.</chron>).</p>\n<p>The other contest, at 1 o'clock, is of particular interest to Cardinals fans --Game 6 of the 1985 National <org>League Championship Series</org>, in which <person>Jack Clark's</person> three-run homer in the top of the ninth inning was the key cog in vaulting the Redbirds into the World Series. They trailed 5-4, with two out, when Clark stepped to the plate. Then <person>Ken Dayley</person> retired the <org>Dodgers</org> in order in the bottom of the inning to ignite the celebration.</p>\n<p>REMEMBERING 'UNCLE WES:' The death this week of pro basketball Hall of Famer <person>Wes Unseld</person> was particularity hard on <org>St. Louis University</org> men's basketball radio analyst and St. Louis American sports editor <person>Earl Austin Jr</person>.</p>\n<p>Unseld was his uncle.</p>\n<p>Austin could not be reached, but shared some of his memories in an article for the American.</p>\n<p>\"To most, he will be remembered as one of the greatest players in the history of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3512659141\">National Basketball Association</org>. . . . To me, he was simply Uncle Wes . . . the younger brother of my late mother <person>Sandra Austin</person>,\" he wrote.</p>\n<p>Unseld was a powerful center with the Baltimore-Capital-<person>Washington Bullets</person> (now the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131366\">Washington Wizards</org>) who led the franchise to its only NBA title, in 1978.</p>\n<p>Austin played basketball while in school and emulated his famous relative.</p>\n<p>\"When I got to college at <org>Lindenwood University</org>, I wore his No. 41 with great pride,\" Austin wrote. \"The biggest compliment I would always get was when people would tell me I played like <person>Wes Unseld</person> without knowing our family connection.\"</p>\n<p>The recollections are special.</p>\n<p>\"Most of all, I will remember Uncle Wes as just being a cool dude to be around. . . . He was a down to earth man with a great sense of humor,\" Austin wrote. \"If you didn't know him, you would have never thought that he was this NBA legend. He never talked about it. He was a quiet man who exhibited great character and strength in everything he did.</p>\n<p>\"Uncle Wes never needed to talk about his basketball greatness. He had a proud nephew in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.stluis\">St. Louis</location> to do it for him.</p>\n<p>\"Rest well Uncle Wes. You were a great player and a great man.\"</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">___</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">(c)2020 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">Visit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>",
