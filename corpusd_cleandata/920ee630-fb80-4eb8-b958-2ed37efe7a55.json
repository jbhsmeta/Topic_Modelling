    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Chemicals &\nChemistry Daily Daily \\-- Current study results on Microbiology have been\npublished. According to news reporting from Sheffield, United Kingdom, by\nNewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Sediment samples were taken from\nsediment adjacent to an urban river in Sheffield in Northern England that had\nsuffered heavy metal pollution due to previous activity of the steel industry\n(between the 17th and 19th centuries).\"\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Sheffield\nHallam University, \"The most abundant heavy metals found in the samples were\nlead, chromium, nickel, arsenic and cobalt, with maximum concentrations of\n412.80 mg kg 25.232 mg kg , 25.196 mg kg , 8.123 mg kg and 7.66 mg kg ,\nrespectively. Enrichment cultures were set up using methane as carbon and\nenergy source, as a result of which a strain of methanotroph was isolated that\nwas shown via 16S rRNA gene sequencing to be a strain Methylomonas koyamae and\ngiven the designation SHU1. M. koyamae SHU1 removed hexavalent chromium from\nan initial concentration of 10 ppm, which was inhibited by the metabolic\ninhibitor sodium azide or the methane monooxygenase inhibitor\nphenylacetylene.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"To the authors'\nknowledge this is the first description of a strain of the widely\nenvironmentally distributed genus Methylomonas that is capable of remediating\nhexavalent chromium.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Isolation of a methane oxidising\nbacterium that bioremediates hexavalent chromium from a formerly\nindustrialised suburban river. _Letters In Applied Microbiology_ , 2020;():.\n_Letters In Applied Microbiology_ can be contacted at: Blackwell Publishing\nInc, 350 Main St, Malden, MA 02148, USA.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Chemicals &amp; Chemistry Daily Daily</org> -- Current study results on Microbiology have been published. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.shffld\">Sheffield, United Kingdom</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Sediment samples were taken from sediment adjacent to an urban river in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.shffld\">Sheffield</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.eng\">Northern England</location> that had suffered heavy metal pollution due to previous activity of the steel industry (between the 17th and 19th centuries).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2765430903\">Sheffield Hallam University</org>, &#8220;The most abundant heavy metals found in the samples were lead, chromium, nickel, arsenic and cobalt, with maximum concentrations of 412.80 mg kg 25.232 mg kg , 25.196 mg kg , 8.123 mg kg and 7.66 mg kg , respectively. Enrichment cultures were set up using methane as carbon and energy source, as a result of which a strain of methanotroph was isolated that was shown via 16S rRNA gene sequencing to be a strain Methylomonas koyamae and given the designation SHU1. M. koyamae SHU1 removed hexavalent chromium from an initial concentration of 10 ppm, which was inhibited by the metabolic inhibitor sodium azide or the methane monooxygenase inhibitor phenylacetylene.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;To the authors&#8217; knowledge this is the first description of a strain of the widely environmentally distributed genus Methylomonas that is capable of remediating hexavalent chromium.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Isolation of a methane oxidising bacterium that bioremediates hexavalent chromium from a formerly industrialised suburban river. <em>Letters In Applied Microbiology</em>, 2020;():. <em>Letters In Applied Microbiology</em> can be contacted at: <org>Blackwell Publishing Inc</org>, <location>350 Main St</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.malden\">Malden, MA</location> 02148, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">USA</location>.
