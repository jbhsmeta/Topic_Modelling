    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Education\nDaily Report -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our\njournalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:\n\n\"Diagnostic assessments measure the knowledge, skills, and understandings of\nstudents at a smaller and more actionable grain size than traditional scale-\nscore assessments.\n\n\"Results of diagnostic assessments are reported as a mastery profile,\nindicating which knowledge, skills, and understandings the student has\nmastered and which ones may need more instruction.\n\n\"These mastery decisions are based on probabilities of mastery derived from\ndiagnostic classification models (DCMs).\n\n\"This report outlines a Bayesian framework for the estimation and evaluation\nof DCMs. Findings illustrate the utility of the Bayesian framework for\nestimating and evaluating DCMs in applied settings. Specifically, the findings\ndemonstrate how a variety of DCMs can be defined within the same conceptual\nframework. Additionally, using this framework, the evaluation of model fit is\nmore straightforward and easier to interpret with intuitive graphics.\nThroughout, recommendations are made for specific implementation decisions for\nthe estimation process and the assessment of model fit.\"\n\nThis preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at Education Daily Report -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from osf.io:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Diagnostic assessments measure the knowledge, skills, and understandings of students at a smaller and more actionable grain size than traditional scale-score assessments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Results of diagnostic assessments are reported as a mastery profile, indicating which knowledge, skills, and understandings the student has mastered and which ones may need more instruction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These mastery decisions are based on probabilities of mastery derived from diagnostic classification models (DCMs).</p>\n<p>&#8220;This report outlines a Bayesian framework for the estimation and evaluation of DCMs. Findings illustrate the utility of the Bayesian framework for estimating and evaluating DCMs in applied settings. Specifically, the findings demonstrate how a variety of DCMs can be defined within the same conceptual framework. Additionally, using this framework, the evaluation of model fit is more straightforward and easier to interpret with intuitive graphics. Throughout, recommendations are made for specific implementation decisions for the estimation process and the assessment of model fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.
