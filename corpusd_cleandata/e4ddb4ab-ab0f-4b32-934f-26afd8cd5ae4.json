    "text": "The St. Tammany Parish Planning and Zoning commissions will meet in Mandeville\nin June to consider three months worth of agendas.\n\nThe commissioners were unable to meet in April and May because of coronavirus\nrestrictions that prohibited most gatherings and required social distancing,\neven in smaller groups.\n\nNow that COVID-19 restrictions have been somewhat relaxed, the commissions\nwill meet in June. But the meetings will be relocated in order to comply with\nthe social distancing rules that are still in force.\n\nThe 6 p.m. meetings, all to be held in the Castine Center at Pelican Park,\ninclude:\n\nJune 9 \\- April planning agenda;\n\nJune 10 \\- May and June planning agendas;\n\nJune 23 \\- April zoning agenda; and\n\nJune 24 \\- May and June zoning agendas.\n\nParish public information officer Amy Bouton said all attendees will be\nrequired to wear face masks or coverings and must submit to a temperature\ncheck before entering the meetings.\n\nBouton said the adjusted schedule was necessary to satisfy public notice\nrequirements and to accommodate the availability of commission members and the\nCastine Center.\n\nUsing the Castine Center will also allow all parties to present their cases\nand relevant materials while maintaining safe social distancing, she said.\n\nThe meetings normally take place in the Parish Council Chambers on Koop Drive\nin Mandeville.\n\nCovington attorney Jeff Schoen, who represents petitioners before both\ncommissions almost every month, said his clients have been frustrated by the\ndelays but understand they were necessary.\n\n\"They were dealt a set of circumstances that no one could have envisioned,\"\nSchoen said.\n\nHe called planning and zoning \"the engine for a lot of the economy in St.\nTammany Parish.\" And, he said, \"That engine is cool, and we need to know when\nwe're going to crank it up.\"\n\nBouton said the public should monitor local media, the St. Tammany Parish\nwebsite, [www.stpgov.org](http://www.stpgov.org), parish social media and\nlegal advertisements to stay informed on when and where all parish meetings\nwill take place and how St. Tammany is reopening.",

    "html": "<p>The St. Tammany Parish Planning and Zoning commissions will meet in Mandeville in June to consider three months worth of agendas.</p>\n<p>The commissioners were unable to meet in April and May because of coronavirus restrictions that prohibited most gatherings and required social distancing, even in smaller groups.</p>\n\n<p>Now that COVID-19 restrictions have been somewhat relaxed, the commissions will meet in June. But the meetings will be relocated in order to comply with the social distancing rules that are still in force.</p>\n\n<p>The <chron>6 p.m.</chron> meetings, all to be held in the Castine Center at <location>Pelican Park</location>, include:</p>\n\n<p>  <chron>June 9</chron> - April planning agenda;</p>\n\n<p>  <chron>June 10</chron> - May and June planning agendas;</p>\n\n<p>  <chron>June 23</chron> - April zoning agenda; and</p>\n\n<p>  <chron>June 24</chron> - May and June zoning agendas.</p>\n\n<p>Parish public information officer <person>Amy Bouton</person> said all attendees will be required to wear face masks or coverings and must submit to a temperature check before entering the meetings.</p>\n\n<p>Bouton said the adjusted schedule was necessary to satisfy public notice requirements and to accommodate the availability of commission members and the Castine Center.</p>\n\n<p>Using the Castine Center will also allow all parties to present their cases and relevant materials while maintaining safe social distancing, she said.</p>\n\n<p>The meetings normally take place in the Parish Council Chambers on <location>Koop Drive</location> in Mandeville.</p>\n\n<p>Covington attorney <person>Jeff Schoen</person>, who represents petitioners before both commissions almost every month, said his clients have been frustrated by the delays but understand they were necessary.</p>\n\n<p>\"They were dealt a set of circumstances that no one could have envisioned,\" Schoen said.</p>\n\n<p>He called planning and zoning \"the engine for a lot of the economy in St. Tammany Parish.\" And, he said, \"That engine is cool, and we need to know when we're going to crank it up.\"</p>\n\n<p>Bouton said the public should monitor local media, the St. Tammany Parish website, <a href=\"http://www.stpgov.org\">www.stpgov.org</a>, parish social media and legal advertisements to stay informed on when and where all parish meetings will take place and how St. Tammany is reopening.</p>",
