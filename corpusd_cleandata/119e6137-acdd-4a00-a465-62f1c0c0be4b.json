    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Electronics\nBusiness Daily \\-- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a\npatent by the inventors Nesheim, Tom Inge (Sandsli, NO); Tonning, Daniel\n(Laksevag, NO), filed on July 12, 2017, was published online on June 8, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee for patent number 10,663,278 is OneSubsea IP UK Limited\n(London, United Kingdom).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Proximity measuring of the rotating shaft of a\nsubsea pump or subsea compressor can give valuable information of the running\nconditions of the pump or compressors. Proximity measurement of rotating\nequipment is known in systems operating in low pressure--such as an\natmospheric environment found topside. However, proximity sensing of a\nrotating shaft is much more challenging in subsea pumps or compressors since\nthe process fluid pressures can be in the range of 15-20 kPsi, and where\nassociated electronics needs to be protected against the seabed pressure.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx\ncorrespondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this\npatent: \"This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that\nare further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not\nintended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter,\nnor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining or limiting the scope\nof the claimed subject matter as set forth in the claims.\n\n\"According to some embodiments, a subsea rotating machine having a proximity\nsensing system is described.

Proximity measurement of rotating equipment is known in systems operating in low pressure--such as an atmospheric environment found topside. However, proximity sensing of a rotating shaft is much more challenging in subsea pumps or compressors since the process fluid pressures can be in the range of 15-20 kPsi, and where associated electronics needs to be protected against the seabed pressure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining or limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter as set forth in the claims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to some embodiments, a subsea rotating machine having a proximity sensing system is described.
