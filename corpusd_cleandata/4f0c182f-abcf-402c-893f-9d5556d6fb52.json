    "text": "TALLINN, Jun 05, BNS - The members of the Estonian delegation to the Baltic\nAssembly (BA) are to participate in a video meeting of the welfare committee\nof the BA on Friday to discuss the strategy for exiting the crisis and the\npossible future scenarios.\n\nAccording to chairman of the BA welfare committee Urmas Espenberg, besides the\nfuture scenarios, recent events would also be spoken about at the video\nconference, and the MPs and the ministers of social affairs of the Baltic\nstates would be given an overview of the crisis readiness of health care\ninstitutions at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis as well as of the\nmeasures for combating the crisis, Riigikogu spokespeople said.\n\n\"It is clear that none of us was actually ready for such a large-scale crisis,\nregardless of the tangible signs of danger. Blocking of information by China\nand the inaction of the WHO also had a certain role here. In order to manage\nthe possible future crises successfully and quickly, it is necessary to take\nsteps and share experience with colleagues so that we all could learn from the\nmistakes. Especially if human lives are the price of the mistakes,\" Espenberg\nadded.\n\nMember of the welfare committee Helmen Kutt added that, at the meeting, the\nlessons of the crisis would also be discussed in the light of the social\ncrisis and from the aspect of employment.\n\n\"We will focus on ensuring the livelihoods of people through different\nmeasures, and exchange information about best practices of neighboring\ncountries. Many lost their jobs because of the crisis, and unfortunately, many\npeople may still have to face it, because redundancies and closures of\ncompanies are not over yet. Although the number of infections has dropped\nalmost to minimum, it does not mean that we can consider the issue closed,\nbecause the health crisis will be followed by both social and economic\ncrisis,\" Kutt said.\n\nThe Baltic Assembly is a consultative cooperation organization of the\nparliaments of the three Baltic states, which discusses issues of mutual\ninterest. A 12-member delegation of the Riigikogu represents Estonia in the\nBA. This year, Estonia is holding the presidency of the Baltic Assembly and\nthe Baltic Council of Ministers.\n\nBaltic News Service",

Blocking of information by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and the inaction of the WHO also had a certain role here. In order to manage the possible future crises successfully and quickly, it is necessary to take steps and share experience with colleagues so that we all could learn from the mistakes. Especially if human lives are the price of the mistakes,\" Espenberg added.</p>\n<p>Member of the welfare committee <person>Helmen Kutt</person> added that, at the meeting, the lessons of the crisis would also be discussed in the light of the social crisis and from the aspect of employment.</p>\n<p>\"We will focus on ensuring the livelihoods of people through different measures, and exchange information about best practices of neighboring countries. Many lost their jobs because of the crisis, and unfortunately, many people may still have to face it, because redundancies and closures of companies are not over yet. Although the number of infections has dropped almost to minimum, it does not mean that we can consider the issue closed, because the health crisis will be followed by both social and economic crisis,\" Kutt said.</p>\n<p><org>The Baltic Assembly</org> is a consultative cooperation organization of the parliaments of the three Baltic states, which discusses issues of mutual interest. A 12-member delegation of the Riigikogu represents <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ee\">Estonia</location> in the BA. This year, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ee\">Estonia</location> is holding the presidency of the <org>Baltic Assembly</org> and the <org>Baltic Council of Ministers</org>.</p>\n<p><org>Baltic News Service</org></p>",
