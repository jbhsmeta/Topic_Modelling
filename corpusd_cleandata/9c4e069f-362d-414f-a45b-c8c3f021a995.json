    "text": "The cabinet is set to approve the Netting of Financial Contracts Bill 2020,\ndesigned to remove uncertainty about enforcing netting rights in case of\nbankruptcy and allow financial collateral arrangements in the domestic market.\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has proposed the bill in consultation with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\n\nSources told The Express Tribune that the proposed law would remove any\nuncertainty about enforcing netting rights in case of a termination event,\nbankruptcy, insolvency proceedings, would limit the power of liquidators to\nprevent any cherry-picking of qualified financial contracts/ transactions,\nwhich fall under the ambit of netting provisions, and would allow financial\ncollateral arrangements under such netting rights.\n\nOnce the law is enforced, qualified financial contracts will always be settled\non the basis of netting in the presence of a netting agreement.\n\nNetting is a method of reducing risks in financial contracts by combining\nmultiple financial obligations to arrive at a net obligation amount. Netting\nis used to reduce settlement, credit and other financial risks between two or\nmore parties.\n\nThe development of financial markets in Pakistan over the years has led to the\nintroduction of innovative financial products and increased exposure of banks\nand other financial market participants.\n\nThe complexities caused by such new products and increased exposure of banks\nrequire the adoption of laws that could prevent and reduce risk in the\nfinancial system.",

Netting is used to reduce settlement, credit and other financial risks between two or more parties.</p>\n<p>The development of financial markets in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location> over the years has led to the introduction of innovative financial products and increased exposure of banks and other financial market participants.</p>\n<p>The complexities caused by such new products and increased exposure of banks require the adoption of laws that could prevent and reduce risk in the financial system.</p>",
