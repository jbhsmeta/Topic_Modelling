    "text": "The Mainland-based firm hit the market last week, following three other\nChinese healthcare-related issuers that have listed in Hong Kong since March.\nThe sector has been defiant through the coronavirus crisis, remaining one of\nthe few popular sectors, running counter-cyclical to downward trending global\nfinancial markets.\n\nKintor Pharma kicked off bookbuilding with sole sponsor Huatai Financial and\nglobal co-ordinators CICC and UBS on May 12. They took orders for the deal\nthrough a four-day virtual roadshow.\n\nThe trio - working alongside bookrunners CCB International, China Everbright\nSecurities, China Renaissance Securities, CMB International and Haitong\ninternational - marketed 92.3m shares at HK$17.80 to HK$20.15 apiece. The\nprice guidance meant it could raise anywhere from HK$1.64bn to HK$1.86bn from\nthe IPO.\n\nKintor, a clinical-stage novel cancer drug developer, came to the market to\nraise funds for developing and commercialising its core products.\n\nTo set the IPO on a good base and boost confidence in the deal, the company\nplaced 48% of the offer with four cornerstone investors. The majority was\ntaken by Chinese state-backed Zhuhai Gree Financial Investment Management,\nwhich subscribed for $98m.\n\nEntities Cherry Cheeks and Highlight Medical, both indirectly controlled by\npre-IPO investor Stephen Hui Wang, took $7m and $5m, respectively. Chinese\ninvestment bank DFZQ, also known as Orient Securities, claimed $5m of the\ndeal.\n\nAfter bookbuilding through to the end of last week, the syndicate wrapped up\nthe deal. Thanks to the horde of institutional and retail investors, the leads\nwere able to price the IPO at the top of the range, according to a source\nclose to the deal.\n\nThe institutional book had over 120 long-only investors, healthcare\nspecialists, hedge funds and high net worth accounts. But Hong Kong retail\ninvestors subscribed their portion of the deal over 500 times, triggering the\nfull clawback - a mechanism that reallocates stock to retail based on the\nlevel of demand.\n\nThe full clawback left just $41m of the IPO for institutional investors. And\nwith half going to the top 10 accounts - a mix of long only investors and\nhealthcare specialists - a larger number of investors got zero allocation of\nthe stock, according to the source.\n\nKintor's shares will go live at HK$20.15 apiece on the Hong Kong Stock\nExchange on May 22. The deal also includes a 15% greenshoe of 13.9m shares.\n\nThe issuer will invest 70% of the IPO proceeds in the development and\ncommercialisation of its core products. Kintor's lead drug is Proxalutamide,\nwhich is undergoing trials related to prostate cancer and breast cancer.\n\nThe firm will also put 20% of the proceeds towards clinical and pre-clinical\nstage drug candidates and study projects, and use the balance for working\ncapital and other general corporate purposes.\n\nKintor has suffered somewhat from the Covid-19 pandemic, with the forced\nclosure of its Miami-based clinical trial centre. The company warned in its\nprospectus that it cannot assure Covid-19 will have no further impact on its\nbusiness, but it does not expect to make any \"material deviation\" from the\ndevelopment of its drugs.\n\nKintor is controlled by co-founder and chief executive Youzhi Tong and co-\nfounder Chuangxing Guo. Following the IPO, the duo's aggregate stake in the\ncompany has been diluted from 36.84% to 27.64%.\n\n **\n\n **New Horizon Health mandates for IPO **\n\n**\n\nChinese biotechnology firm New Horizon Health has mandated Goldman Sachs and\nUBS for a Hong Kong IPO, _GlobalCapital Asia_ understands.\n\nFounded in 2013, New Horizon Health manufactures home kits for screening colon\ncancer, designed to catch signs of the disease early.\n\nThe company is backed by numerous investors, including Chinese venture capital\nspecialist Qiming Venture Partners, China-focused private equity firm\nFountainVest Partners, Softbank's SB China Capital and US research university\nDuke University.\n\nNew Horizon Health most recently raised $20m through a series D financing\nround in April, bringing its total investment so far to $130m.\n\nWith Kintor Pharma's IPO priced, New Horizon Health would follow at least four\nfirms out of the Chinese healthcare sector this year, including InnoCare\nPharma, Akesobio and Peijia Medical. The trio floated for HK$2.2bn, HK$2.6bn\nand HK$2.3bn, respectively.",

    "html": "<p>The Mainland-based firm hit the market last week, following three other Chinese healthcare-related issuers that have listed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> since March. The sector has been defiant through the coronavirus crisis, remaining one of the few popular sectors, running counter-cyclical to downward trending global financial markets.</p><p>Kintor Pharma kicked off bookbuilding with sole sponsor Huatai Financial and global co-ordinators CICC and <org>UBS</org> on <chron>May 12</chron>. They took orders for the deal through a four-day virtual roadshow.</p><p>The trio &#8211; working alongside bookrunners <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3752099081\">CCB International</org>, <org>China Everbright Securities</org>, <org>China Renaissance Securities</org>, <org>CMB International</org> and Haitong international &#8211; marketed 92.3m shares at <money>HK$17.80</money> to <money>HK$20.15</money> apiece. The price guidance meant it could raise anywhere from <money>HK$1.64bn</money> to <money>HK$1.86bn</money> from the IPO.</p><p>Kintor, a clinical-stage novel cancer drug developer, came to the market to raise funds for developing and commercialising its core products. </p><p>To set the IPO on a good base and boost confidence in the deal, the company placed 48% of the offer with four cornerstone investors. The majority was taken by Chinese state-backed <org>Zhuhai Gree Financial Investment Management</org>, which subscribed for <money>$98m</money>.</p><p>Entities <person>Cherry Cheeks</person> and Highlight Medical, both indirectly controlled by pre-IPO investor <person>Stephen Hui Wang</person>, took <money>$7m</money> and <money>$5m</money>, respectively. Chinese investment bank <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"HongKong:3958\">DFZQ</org>, also known as <org>Orient Securities</org>, claimed <money>$5m</money> of the deal.</p><p>After bookbuilding through to the end of last week, the syndicate wrapped up the deal. Thanks to the horde of institutional and retail investors, the leads were able to price the IPO at the top of the range, according to a source close to the deal.</p><p>The institutional book had over 120 long-only investors, healthcare specialists, hedge funds and high net worth accounts. But <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> retail investors subscribed their portion of the deal over 500 times, triggering the full clawback &#8211; a mechanism that reallocates stock to retail based on the level of demand.</p><p>The full clawback left just <money>$41m</money> of the IPO for institutional investors. And with half going to the top 10 accounts &#8211; a mix of long only investors and healthcare specialists &#8211; a larger number of investors got zero allocation of the stock, according to the source.</p><p>Kintor&#8217;s shares will go live at <money>HK$20.15</money> apiece on the <org>Hong Kong Stock Exchange</org> on <chron>May 22</chron>. The deal also includes a 15% greenshoe of 13.9m shares.</p><p>The issuer will invest 70% of the IPO proceeds in the development and commercialisation of its core products. Kintor&#8217;s lead drug is Proxalutamide, which is undergoing trials related to prostate cancer and breast cancer.</p><p>The firm will also put 20% of the proceeds towards clinical and pre-clinical stage drug candidates and study projects, and use the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.</p><p>Kintor has suffered somewhat from the Covid-19 pandemic, with the forced closure of its <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.miami\">Miami</location>-based clinical trial centre. The company warned in its prospectus that it cannot assure Covid-19 will have no further impact on its business, but it does not expect to make any &#8220;material deviation&#8221; from the development of its drugs.</p><p>Kintor is controlled by co-founder and chief executive <person>Youzhi Tong</person> and co-founder Chuangxing Guo. Following the IPO, the duo&#8217;s aggregate stake in the company has been diluted from 36.84% to 27.64%.</p><b><p><b><org>New Horizon Health</org> mandates for IPO </b></p></b><p>Chinese biotechnology firm <org>New Horizon Health</org> has mandated Goldman Sachs and <org>UBS</org> for a Hong Kong IPO, <i>GlobalCapital Asia</i> understands.</p><p>Founded in 2013, <org>New Horizon Health</org> manufactures home kits for screening colon cancer, designed to catch signs of the disease early.</p><p>The company is backed by numerous investors, including Chinese venture capital specialist <org>Qiming Venture Partners</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>-focused private equity firm <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2706163098\">FountainVest Partners</org>, Softbank&#8217;s <org>SB China Capital</org> and US research university <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0356235695\">Duke University</org>.</p><p><org>New Horizon Health</org> most recently raised <money>$20m</money> through a series D financing round in April, bringing its total investment so far to <money>$130m</money>.</p><p>With Kintor Pharma&#8217;s IPO priced, <org>New Horizon Health</org> would follow at least four firms out of the Chinese healthcare sector this year, including <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"HongKong:9969\">InnoCare Pharma</org>, Akesobio and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Frankfurt:4WO\">Peijia Medical</org>.
