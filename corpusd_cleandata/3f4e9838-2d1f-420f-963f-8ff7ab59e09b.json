    "text": "The face mask. It's our protection against COVID-19.\n\nIt's also an apt symbol for what's taking place at the highest levels of\nFlorida's government, and it's dangerous for democracy.\n\nSilencing a political opponent is routine in authoritarian regimes and banana\nrepublics. But Gov. Ron DeSantis has gone to elaborate lengths to muzzle the\nvoice of Nikki Fried, the elected state agriculture commissioner.\n\nAs one of three independently chosen members of the Florida Cabinet and the\nonly Democrat elected statewide, Fried is the one person in high office who\ndoesn't applaud every DeSantis decision.\n\nSo the governor refused to put Fried on a statewide task force to advise him\non how and when to re-open the state. She also says the governor's people\nroutinely ignore her staff.\n\nBy squelching Fried's voice in the Tallahassee political wilderness, DeSantis\nis the one who looks smaller.\n\nThe latest example of this pettiness revealed itself Thursday. After nearly\nfour months, DeSantis convened a Cabinet meeting. But, this being an\nemergency, it was done by phone. Four disembodied voices.\n\nThat prevented the public from being heard. But more importantly from the\ngovernor's point of view, it made it impossible for Fried to engage in a give-\nand-take with the governor on such timely issues as the economic collapse and\nits effect on the state budget; levels of COVID-19 testing; and the broken\nunemployment benefits website that has frustrated Floridians and become a\nnational embarrassment.\n\nDay by day, we're witnessing the slow-motion death of transparency in the\nstate that pioneered the concept of \"sunshine\" five decades ago.\n\nAn emergency declaration itself serves as a shield. The state presumably has\nmore urgent matters, so routine press inquiries to the governor's office go\nunanswered, including for this column. Agencies stonewall requests for\nrecords. Even the most basic piece of information, the governor's daily\nschedule, sometimes is not released until 8 p.m.\n\nFried sent DeSantis a letter May 19, asking that three top state agency heads\nappear before the Cabinet to answer questions, including the firing of Rebekah\nJones, a Department of Health data scientist. The letter went unanswered and\nthe agency heads stayed away.\n\nOnly Fried, sporting a blue mask, showed up in the Cabinet room in the\nbasement of the Capitol building in Tallahassee.\n\nThat's the same room where DeSantis has repeatedly summoned the media over the\npast few weeks to give updates on the pandemic. If it's safe for him to be\nthere with a bunch of strangers, why isn't it also safe for him and three\nCabinet members to be there, wearing masks and separated by social distancing?\nIt's because that would have given a Democratic officeholder a platform to\nhold him accountable.\n\nThis is how life in Florida has evolved over the past three months. We're all\nliving in an indefinite state of emergency and most Floridians have responded\nwith restraint by limiting their movements to reduce spread of the virus. But\nunlike other states, Florida Legislature has acquiesced and deferred all\ndecision-making to DeSantis, who can unilaterally exercise broad powers in an\nemergency.\n\nFried has been persistent in questioning DeSantis' decisions, but she has not\nbeen strident or excessively partisan. She faulted him for a \"piecemeal\"\napproach early in the crisis, but in late April said she was \"encouraged by\nthis cautious approach\" to a slow re-opening.\n\nBy repeatedly marginalizing Fried, DeSantis demonstrates an intolerance of\ncriticism that's troubling at any time, but especially in a statewide\nemergency. Dissent is not disloyal. A strong, confident governor should\nwelcome it in a democracy.\n\nPandemic or not, life goes on.\n\nWe still have a two-party system. And Florida, alone among the 50 states, has\na quirky arrangement called a Cabinet, in which the governor is required by\nthe Constitution to share power with three other elected officials. Together\nthey oversee a myriad of mundane but important areas: land conservation, law\nenforcement, highway safety, tax collection and state pension fund oversight.\nThe Cabinet used to convene regularly every two weeks; DeSantis scheduled\nseven meetings this year and one was canceled.\n\nWhen the Cabinet helps to promote DeSantis' agenda, he's happy to share the\nstage with his three colleagues. Exactly one year ago this week, all four of\nthem were all smiles at a Cabinet meeting in Israel. It was an effort by the\nnew governor to build goodwill with a critical ally abroad and a key\nconstituency at home.\n\nA year later, Florida faces persistent and troubling questions. Suddenly, the\nCabinet doesn't matter.\n\nDeSantis won by about 32,000 votes or four-tenths of a percentage point. Fried\nwon by a much smaller margin of about 6,800 votes. Both of them received more\nthan 4 million votes. Both speak for us. Both deserve to be heard.\n\nSteve Bousquet is a Sun Sentinel columnist.",

    "html": "<p>The face mask. It's our protection against COVID-19.</p>\n<p>It's also an apt symbol for what's taking place at the highest levels of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> government, and it's dangerous for democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Silencing a political opponent is routine in authoritarian regimes and banana republics. But Gov. <person>Ron DeSantis</person> has gone to elaborate lengths to muzzle the voice of <person>Nikki Fried</person>, the elected state agriculture commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>As one of three independently chosen members of the Florida Cabinet and the only Democrat elected statewide, Fried is the one person in high office who doesn't applaud every DeSantis decision.</p>\n\n<p>So the governor refused to put Fried on a statewide task force to advise him on how and when to re-open the state. She also says the governor's people routinely ignore her staff.</p>\n\n<p>By squelching Fried's voice in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> political wilderness, DeSantis is the one who looks smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The latest example of this pettiness revealed itself Thursday. After nearly four months, DeSantis convened a <org>Cabinet</org> meeting. But, this being an emergency, it was done by phone. Four disembodied voices.</p>\n\n<p>That prevented the public from being heard. But more importantly from the governor's point of view, it made it impossible for Fried to engage in a give-and-take with the governor on such timely issues as the economic collapse and its effect on the state budget; levels of COVID-19 testing; and the broken unemployment benefits website that has frustrated Floridians and become a national embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p>Day by day, we're witnessing the slow-motion death of transparency in the state that pioneered the concept of \"sunshine\" five decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>An emergency declaration itself serves as a shield. The state presumably has more urgent matters, so routine press inquiries to the governor's office go unanswered, including for this column. Agencies stonewall requests for records. Even the most basic piece of information, the governor's daily schedule, sometimes is not released until <chron>8 p.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>Fried sent DeSantis a letter <chron>May 19</chron>, asking that three top state agency heads appear before the <org>Cabinet</org> to answer questions, including the firing of <person>Rebekah Jones</person>, a <org>Department of Health</org> data scientist. The letter went unanswered and the agency heads stayed away.</p>\n\n<p>Only Fried, sporting a blue mask, showed up in the <org>Cabinet</org> room in the basement of the <org>Capitol</org> building in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location>.</p>\n\n<p>That's the same room where DeSantis has repeatedly summoned the media over the past few weeks to give updates on the pandemic. If it's safe for him to be there with a bunch of strangers, why isn't it also safe for him and three <org>Cabinet</org> members to be there, wearing masks and separated by social distancing? It's because that would have given a Democratic officeholder a platform to hold him accountable.</p>\n\n<p>This is how life in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> has evolved over the past three months. We're all living in an indefinite state of emergency and most Floridians have responded with restraint by limiting their movements to reduce spread of the virus. But unlike other states, <org>Florida Legislature</org> has acquiesced and deferred all decision-making to DeSantis, who can unilaterally exercise broad powers in an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>Fried has been persistent in questioning DeSantis' decisions, but she has not been strident or excessively partisan. She faulted him for a \"piecemeal\" approach early in the crisis, but in late April said she was \"encouraged by this cautious approach\" to a slow re-opening.</p>\n\n<p>By repeatedly marginalizing Fried, DeSantis demonstrates an intolerance of criticism that's troubling at any time, but especially in a statewide emergency. Dissent is not disloyal. A strong, confident governor should welcome it in a democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Pandemic or not, life goes on.</p>\n\n<p>We still have a two-party system. And <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, alone among the 50 states, has a quirky arrangement called a <org>Cabinet</org>, in which the governor is required by the <org>Constitution</org> to share power with three other elected officials. Together they oversee a myriad of mundane but important areas: land conservation, law enforcement, highway safety, tax collection and state pension fund oversight. The <org>Cabinet</org> used to convene regularly every two weeks; DeSantis scheduled seven meetings this year and one was canceled.</p>\n\n<p>When the <org>Cabinet</org> helps to promote DeSantis' agenda, he's happy to share the stage with his three colleagues. Exactly one year ago this week, all four of them were all smiles at a <org>Cabinet</org> meeting in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/il\">Israel</location>. It was an effort by the new governor to build goodwill with a critical ally abroad and a key constituency at home.</p>\n\n<p>A year later, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> faces persistent and troubling questions. Suddenly, the <org>Cabinet</org> doesn't matter.</p>\n\n<p>DeSantis won by about 32,000 votes or four-tenths of a percentage point. Fried won by a much smaller margin of about 6,800 votes. Both of them received more than 4 million votes. Both speak for us. Both deserve to be heard.</p>\n\n<p><person>Steve Bousquet</person> is a <org>Sun Sentinel</org> columnist.</p>",
