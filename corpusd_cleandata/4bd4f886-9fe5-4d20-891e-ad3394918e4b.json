    "text": "LINCOLN \\- JD Spielman's record-setting career at Nebraska almost certainly\nwould have reached new heights this fall. The senior receiver instead will\nfinish his career somewhere other than Lincoln after three productive seasons.\n\nTwo Nebraska sources confirmed Monday that NU's leading receiver from the 2019\nseason won't return and will enter the transfer portal. On March 2, coach\nScott Frost said Spielman was dealing with a personal health matter and would\nnot participate in spring practices. The coach added at the time that he\nexpected the wideout to return for summer conditioning in May.\n\n\"JD has been a phenomenal player around here for a long time,\" Frost said\nduring his signing day press conference. \"We're lucky to have him back another\nseason. I'm excited to coach a guy who could be the all-time leading receiver\nin Nebraska history and have a piece of that as a coach. I'm really impressed\nwith his toughness and what he's done for his entire career at Nebraska.\"\n\nThe son of Minnesota Vikings general manager Rick Spielman, who attended most\nof JD's games, Spielman departs holding multiple school records, including\nreceiving yards in a game (209 at Wisconsin in 2018) and career double-digit-\nreception games (two, with 11 against Ohio State in 2017 and 10 against Purdue\nin 2018). He is also the only Husker to reach the 200-yard receiving plateau\nin a game, which he's done twice.\n\nSpielman's departure leaves sophomore Wan'Dale Robinson as one of the few\nHuskers with meaningful game experience back from 2019, though much of that\ncame at running back out of necessity. NU was slated to have just five\nscholarship wideouts for spring practices, including veteran walk-on Kade\nWarner and promising freshman Alante Brown.\n\nIt is welcoming a well-regarded 2020 group of receivers, including Zavier\nBetts, Marcus Fleming, Will Nixon, Omar Manning and Brown. That group of\nreceivers, coupled with the continued growth of Robinson, likely would have\nreduced Spielman's production as a senior. He also would have been playing for\nhis third receivers coach, new offensive coordinator Matt Lubick, who took\nover for Troy Walters in January.\n\nStill, Spielman - a 5-foot-9, 180-pound native of Eden Prairie, Minnesota \\-\nalmost certainly would have added more accolades had he stayed for the 2020\ncampaign. Mainly a slot receiver who built a reputation for his toughness and\nelusiveness, Spielman ranks third in NU history in career receptions (170) and\nis 20 from Stanley Morgan's top mark. He's also third in career receiving\nyards (2,546) and 202 from topping Morgan's number there. He has caught a pass\nin all 33 of his career games - good for fourth all-time at NU- and was six\naway from topping Morgan's total.\n\nHe leaves Nebraska with eight career games of 100 receiving yards or more,\nwhich ranks second at NU and is two behind the total of 1972 Heisman Trophy\nwinner Johnny Rodgers.\n\nIn 2019, Spielman paced the Huskers with 49 catches for 898 yards and five\nreceiving touchdowns while playing every game. His receiving yards were a\ncareer high and ranked sixth on NU's single-season list.\n\nSpielman is planning to enter the transfer portal, though he must apply for a\nwaiver to be eligible in 2020. He has not graduated and previously used his\nredshirt season in 2016 after arriving in Lincoln as a Mike Riley recruit.\nSpielman could play immediately without a waiver should he transfer to an FCS\nschool.\n\nIt has been radio silence from the Spielman camp ever since his spring\ndeparture. He has been active on social media on topics related to recent\nracial protests in the country but has not commented publicly about his\nfootball future. On May 29, former NU receivers coach Keith Williams posted a\nvideo of Spielman catching a soccer ball and football during a workout.\n\nSpielman liked to keep a low profile in the program. He has turned down\nconsistent interview requests, including for all of the 2019 season. He last\nspoke in a postgame press conference in 2018, at Wisconsin, when he caught\nnine passes for a school-record 209 yards.\n\nOther career notables:\n\n\u00bb His 77.2 career receiving yards per game is tops in school history, ahead of\nRodgers and his 72.9 mark.\n\n\u00bb He is the only NU player with 2,000 receiving yards before his senior\nseason.\n\n\u00bb He has three of the top 10 receiving seasons in school history and is the\nfirst Husker to post three 800-yard receiving seasons.\n\n\u00bb He joins Rodgers and Niles Paul as the only NU players with a return\ntouchdown (punt or kickoff) in three straight seasons.\n\n\u00bb Among active 2020 FBS receivers, he's second in career receiving yards and\nthird in career receptions. He's also third in career all-purpose yards\n(3,725).",

    "title": "JD Spielman officially leaving Husker football program",
    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ne.lincln\">LINCOLN</location> - JD Spielman's record-setting career at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ne\">Nebraska</location> almost certainly would have reached new heights this fall. The senior receiver instead will finish his career somewhere other than <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ne.lincln\">Lincoln</location> after three productive seasons.</p>\n<p>Two <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ne\">Nebraska</location> sources confirmed Monday that NU's leading receiver from the 2019 season won't return and will enter the transfer portal. On <chron>March 2</chron>, coach <person>Scott Frost</person> said Spielman was dealing with a personal health matter and would not participate in spring practices. The coach added at the time that he expected the wideout to return for summer conditioning in May.</p>\n\n<p>\"JD has been a phenomenal player around here for a long time,\" Frost said during his signing day press conference. \"We're lucky to have him back another season. I'm excited to coach a guy who could be the all-time leading receiver in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ne\">Nebraska</location> history and have a piece of that as a coach. I'm really impressed with his toughness and what he's done for his entire career at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ne\">Nebraska</location>.\"</p>\n\n<p>The son of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131542\">Minnesota Vikings</org> general manager <person>Rick Spielman</person>, who attended most of JD's games, Spielman departs holding multiple school records, including receiving yards in a game (209 at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> in 2018) and career double-digit-reception games (two, with 11 against <org>Ohio State</org> in 2017 and 10 against Purdue in 2018). He is also the only Husker to reach the 200-yard receiving plateau in a game, which he's done twice.</p>\n\n<p>Spielman's departure leaves sophomore Wan'Dale Robinson as one of the few <org>Huskers</org> with meaningful game experience back from 2019, though much of that came at running back out of necessity. NU was slated to have just five scholarship wideouts for spring practices, including veteran walk-on <person>Kade Warner</person> and promising freshman <person>Alante Brown</person>.</p>\n\n<p>It is welcoming a well-regarded 2020 group of receivers, including <person>Zavier Betts</person>, <person>Marcus Fleming</person>, <person>Will Nixon</person>, <person>Omar Manning</person> and Brown. That group of receivers, coupled with the continued growth of Robinson, likely would have reduced Spielman's production as a senior. He also would have been playing for his third receivers coach, new offensive coordinator <person>Matt Lubick</person>, who took over for <person>Troy Walters</person> in January.</p>\n\n<p>Still, Spielman - a 5-foot-9, 180-pound native of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.ederie\">Eden Prairie, Minnesota</location> - almost certainly would have added more accolades had he stayed for the 2020 campaign. Mainly a slot receiver who built a reputation for his toughness and elusiveness, Spielman ranks third in NU history in career receptions (170) and is 20 from <person>Stanley Morgan's</person> top mark. He's also third in career receiving yards (2,546) and 202 from topping Morgan's number there. He has caught a pass in all 33 of his career games - good for fourth all-time at NU- and was six away from topping Morgan's total.</p>\n\n<p>He leaves <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ne\">Nebraska</location> with eight career games of 100 receiving yards or more, which ranks second at NU and is two behind the total of 1972 <org>Heisman Trophy</org> winner <person>Johnny Rodgers</person>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Spielman paced the <org>Huskers</org> with 49 catches for 898 yards and five receiving touchdowns while playing every game. His receiving yards were a career high and ranked sixth on NU's single-season list.</p>\n\n<p>Spielman is planning to enter the transfer portal, though he must apply for a waiver to be eligible in 2020. He has not graduated and previously used his redshirt season in 2016 after arriving in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ne.lincln\">Lincoln</location> as a <person>Mike Riley</person> recruit. Spielman could play immediately without a waiver should he transfer to an <org>FCS</org> school.</p>\n\n<p>It has been radio silence from the Spielman camp ever since his spring departure. He has been active on social media on topics related to recent racial protests in the country but has not commented publicly about his football future. On <chron>May 29</chron>, former NU receivers coach <person>Keith Williams</person> posted a video of Spielman catching a soccer ball and football during a workout.</p>\n\n<p>Spielman liked to keep a low profile in the program. He has turned down consistent interview requests, including for all of the 2019 season. He last spoke in a postgame press conference in 2018, at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location>, when he caught nine passes for a school-record 209 yards.</p>\n\n<p>Other career notables:</p>\n\n<p>&#187; His 77.2 career receiving yards per game is tops in school history, ahead of Rodgers and his 72.9 mark.</p>\n\n<p>&#187; He is the only NU player with 2,000 receiving yards before his senior season.</p>\n\n<p>&#187; He has three of the top 10 receiving seasons in school history and is the first Husker to post three 800-yard receiving seasons.</p>\n\n<p>&#187; He joins Rodgers and <person>Niles Paul</person> as the only NU players with a return touchdown (punt or kickoff) in three straight seasons.</p>\n\n<p>&#187; Among active 2020 <org>FBS</org> receivers, he's second in career receiving yards and third in career receptions. He's also third in career all-purpose yards (3,725).</p>",
