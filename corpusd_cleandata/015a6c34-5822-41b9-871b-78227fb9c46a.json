    "text": "IT seems fitting that the first major European football league to return was\nthe German Bundesliga.\n\nI don't wish to dine out on national stereotypes - but sometimes, there's no\nsmoke without fire. So, when their response to the Coronavirus and political\nleadership has been suitably well organised and efficient, certainly in\ncomparison to our own; you have to wonder if they'll start beating us in\npenalty shoot-outs again soon!\n\nThe return of their football has certainly shown the way forward for the\nEnglish game, with the Premier League and latterly the Championship since\ngoing public with their plans to restart later this month.\n\nThis is to be welcomed, but only if they can ensure that everyone involved is\nsafe and it doesn't detract from wider coronavirus-tackling efforts across\nsociety. And at the minute, that's an awfully big if.\n\nWhen you have players like Troy Deeney, who has a young child with respiratory\nproblems, understandably refusing to play, how can we guarantee the\ncompetition's integrity? Let's hope that clubs like Watford are not unduly\npenalised for their key players having caring responsibilities.\n\nSome clubs have tried to resist football's resumption, seemingly largely\ndriven by self-interest, but it has been good to see those wrecking efforts\nresisted.\n\nThese teething problems notwithstanding, even though football has almost been\nofficially cancelled in League Two (with League One expected to be resolved\nnext in some form or another); the Championship's return does bode well for\nlower league clubs.\n\nHopefully it will help solve once and for all the ongoing issue of promotion\nand relegation throughout the pyramid. When you look at the ongoing purgatory\nthe likes of Barrow and Crewe have faced this last two months, mid-table\nmediocrity has never felt so good.\n\nWhat the likes of Grimsby Town will be hoping is that Championship sides\nreturning to action will provide robust examples of how live matches and\ncontact training sessions can be run safely.\n\nWhat are the safety precautions like? How are we ensuring there can be no\nspike in cases? How has football's integrity been affected by the three month-\nplus sabbatical? These questions can only be answered over time, but are\nparticularly crucial in League Two and below - where there is no doubt that\nclubs can't afford to stage games behind closed doors. Let's just hope that\nthis can be run well, with effective lessons learned from the inevitable bumps\nin the road and mistakes. This is the EFL after all.\n\nA number of clubs at our level have expressed hopes that live football could\nbe back by September, which given this is when the Championship provisionally\nhopes that it will be able to start next season by; seems reasonably sensible\n- if perhaps a touch ambitious given the country's ongoing issues, and by\ninternational comparisons, our relatively large number of ongoing cases.\n\nClubs should be strongly considering following the lead of a policy set by\nPolish football, which has set a capacity limit of 25 per cent for returning\nfootball.\n\nIt's not that much of a stretch when you think that attendances for League Two\nmatches often do not come anywhere near to a ground's capacity.\n\nIf that's the price of not only returning to live football, but also doing so\nin a safe and sustainable manner; then sign me up.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who feels like this, and supporters consistently\nexpress the same hopes. Because after nearly three months of lockdown and the\ntotal suspension of live football; standing on a sparsely populated terrace\nwatching mediocre action has never sounded like such heaven.\n\nCREDIT: By MAX BELL\n[sport@grimsbytelegraph.co.uk](mailto:sport@grimsbytelegraph.co.uk)\n@Max_Bell_11\n\nCAPTION: Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United will be able to look to the\nChampionship for examples of how live matches and contact training sessions\ncan be run safely.",

    "title": "Championship restart bodes well for League Two's hopes: columnist max bell says league two can learn from championship - and prepare for a september start",
    "html": "<p>IT seems fitting that the first major European football league to return was the German Bundesliga.</p>\n<p>I don't wish to dine out on national stereotypes - but sometimes, there's no smoke without fire. So, when their response to the Coronavirus and political leadership has been suitably well organised and efficient, certainly in comparison to our own; you have to wonder if they'll start beating us in penalty shoot-outs again soon!</p>\n<p>The return of their football has certainly shown the way forward for the English game, with the <org>Premier League</org> and latterly the Championship since going public with their plans to restart later this month.</p>\n<p>This is to be welcomed, but only if they can ensure that everyone involved is safe and it doesn't detract from wider coronavirus-tackling efforts across society. And at the minute, that's an awfully big if.</p>\n<p>When you have players like <person>Troy Deeney</person>, who has a young child with respiratory problems, understandably refusing to play, how can we guarantee the competition's integrity? Let's hope that clubs like Watford are not unduly penalised for their key players having caring responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Some clubs have tried to resist football's resumption, seemingly largely driven by self-interest, but it has been good to see those wrecking efforts resisted.</p>\n<p>These teething problems notwithstanding, even though football has almost been officially cancelled in <org>League Two</org> (with <org>League One</org> expected to be resolved next in some form or another); the Championship's return does bode well for lower league clubs.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it will help solve once and for all the ongoing issue of promotion and relegation throughout the pyramid. When you look at the ongoing purgatory the likes of Barrow and Crewe have faced this last two months, mid-table mediocrity has never felt so good.</p>\n<p>What the likes of <location>Grimsby Town</location> will be hoping is that Championship sides returning to action will provide robust examples of how live matches and contact training sessions can be run safely.</p>\n<p>What are the safety precautions like? How are we ensuring there can be no spike in cases? How has football's integrity been affected by the three month-plus sabbatical? These questions can only be answered over time, but are particularly crucial in <org>League Two</org> and below - where there is no doubt that clubs can't afford to stage games behind closed doors. Let's just hope that this can be run well, with effective lessons learned from the inevitable bumps in the road and mistakes. This is the EFL after all.</p>\n<p>A number of clubs at our level have expressed hopes that live football could be back by September, which given this is when the Championship provisionally hopes that it will be able to start next season by; seems reasonably sensible - if perhaps a touch ambitious given the country's ongoing issues, and by international comparisons, our relatively large number of ongoing cases.</p>\n<p>Clubs should be strongly considering following the lead of a policy set by Polish football, which has set a capacity limit of 25 per cent for returning football.</p>\n<p>It's not that much of a stretch when you think that attendances for <org>League Two</org> matches often do not come anywhere near to a ground's capacity.</p>\n<p>If that's the price of not only returning to live football, but also doing so in a safe and sustainable manner; then sign me up.</p>\n<p>I know I'm not the only one who feels like this, and supporters consistently express the same hopes. Because after nearly three months of lockdown and the total suspension of live football; standing on a sparsely populated terrace watching mediocre action has never sounded like such heaven.</p><p /><p>CREDIT: By <person>MAX BELL</person> <a href=\"mailto:sport@grimsbytelegraph.co.uk\">sport@grimsbytelegraph.co.uk</a> @Max_Bell_11</p><p>CAPTION: <location>Grimsby Town</location> and Scunthorpe United will be able to look to the Championship for examples of how live matches and contact training sessions can be run safely.</p>",
