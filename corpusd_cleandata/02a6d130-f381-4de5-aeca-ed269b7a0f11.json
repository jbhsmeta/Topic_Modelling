    "text": "Hip-hop collective [Pro Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Era) applied to\nregister the mark **PRO ERA** for various clothing items, including hats and\ncaps, but was foiled by Opposer New Era Cap, who for decades has extensively\nused, promoted, and protected its registered mark **NEW ERA** in connection\nwith caps. The Board rejected Opposer's claim to ownership of a family of ERA-\nformative mark, but found the NEW ERA mark to be conceptually strong with a\n\"relatively high degree of fame or commercial strength,\" and similar overall\nto the PRO ERA mark in sound, appearance, connotation, and commercial\nimpression. _[New Era Cap Co., Inc. v. Pro Era,\nLLC](http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91216455-OPP-82.pdf)_,\nOpposition No. 91216455 (May 29, 2020) [precedential] (Opinion by Judge Angela\nLykos).  \n![947502a.jpg](http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502a.jpg)  \n**Family of Marks:** Opposer New Era's claim to a family of marks was based on\nits use and promotion of marks such as DRYERA, COOLERA, SOLARERA, WINTERERA,\nDIAMOND ERA, and MICROERA in connection with hats and caps, prior to Pro Era's\nfiling date. The Board noted that although the USPTO may register several\nindividual marks that include a family element, it does not register\n\"families\" of prefixes, suffixes, or other components of a mark. \"Thus, an\nopposer relying on a family of marks is relying on common law rights in the\nalleged family.\"  \nThe seminal case on the family of marks issue is _J & J Snack Foods Corp. v.\nMcDonald's Corp_., 932 F.2d 1460, 18 USPQ2d 1889, 1891-92 (Fed. Cir. 1991:\n\"[a] family of marks is a group of marks having a recognizable common\ncharacteristic, wherein the marks are composed and used in such a way that the\npublic associates not only the individual marks, but the common characteristic\nof the family, with the trademark owner.\"  \n_J &J Snack Foods_ pointed out that it is not enough to merely use a series of\nmarks. The relevant public must recognize that the common characteristic is an\nindicator of source for the goods or services.  \n\nRecognition of the family is achieved when the pattern of usage of the common\nelement is sufficient to be indicative of the origin of the family. It is thus\nnecessary to consider the use, advertisement, and distinctiveness of the\nmarks, including assessment of the contribution of the common feature to the\nrecognition of the marks as of common origin.\n\n  \n__ __  \n![947502b.jpg](http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502b.jpg)  \n****  \n__ __  \n  \n![947502c.jpg](http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502c.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n__  \n![947502d.jpg](http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502d.jpg)  \n**** [\n](https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=9072179&postID=8514218595893988289)  \n\n[ The\nTTABlog](http://www.mondaq.com/redirection.asp?article_id=947502&company_id=8715&redirectaddress=http%3A//thettablog.blogspot.co.uk/)\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

    "title": "Precedential No. 20: TTAB Rejects \"ERA\" Family Of Marks Claim, But Finds PRO ERA Confusable With NEW ERA For Caps",
    "html": "<div> <div />Hip-hop collective <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Era\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Era</a> applied to register the mark <strong>PRO ERA</strong> for various clothing items, including hats and caps, but was foiled by Opposer New <person>Era Cap</person>, who for decades has extensively used, promoted, and protected its registered mark <strong>NEW ERA</strong> in connection with caps. The Board rejected Opposer's claim to ownership of a family of ERA-formative mark, but found the NEW ERA mark to be conceptually strong with a \"relatively high degree of fame or commercial strength,\" and similar overall to the PRO ERA mark in sound, appearance, connotation, and commercial impression. <em><a href=\"http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91216455-OPP-82.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1730439048\">New Era Cap Co., Inc.</org> v. <org>Pro Era, LLC</org></a></em>, Opposition No. 91216455 (<chron>May 29, 2020</chron>) [precedential] (Opinion by Judge <person>Angela Lykos</person>).<br />\n<img alt=\"947502a.jpg\" height=\"207\" src=\"http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502a.jpg\" width=\"320\" /><br /> <strong>Family of Marks:</strong> Opposer New Era's claim to a family of marks was based on its use and promotion of marks such as DRYERA, COOLERA, SOLARERA, WINTERERA, DIAMOND ERA, and MICROERA in connection with hats and caps, prior to Pro Era's filing date. The Board noted that&#160; although the USPTO may register several individual marks that include a family element, it does not register \"families\" of prefixes, suffixes, or other components of a mark. \"Thus, an opposer relying on a family of marks is relying on common law rights in the alleged family.\"<br />\nThe seminal case on the family of marks issue is <em><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:JJSF\">J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp.</org> v. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:MCD\">McDonald's Corp</org></em>., 932 F.2d 1460, 18 USPQ2d 1889, 1891-92 (Fed. Cir. 1991: \"[a] family of marks is a group of marks having a recognizable common characteristic, wherein the marks are composed and used in such a way that the public associates not only the individual marks, but the common characteristic of the family, with the trademark owner.\"<br />\n<em><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:JJSF\">J&amp;J Snack Foods</org></em> pointed out that it is not enough to merely use a series of marks. The relevant public must recognize that the common characteristic is an indicator of source for the goods or services.<br />\n<div style=\"margin-left: 2em\">Recognition of the family is achieved when the pattern of usage of the common element is sufficient to be indicative of the origin of the family. It is thus necessary to consider the use, advertisement, and distinctiveness of the marks, including assessment of the contribution of the common feature to the recognition of the marks as of common origin.</div>\n<br />\n<em>\n</em>\n<em>\n</em>\n<br />\n<img alt=\"947502b.jpg\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502b.jpg\" width=\"241\" />\n<br />\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<br />\n<em>\n</em>\n<em>\n</em>\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"947502c.jpg\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502c.jpg\" width=\"200\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<em>\n</em>\n<br />\n<img alt=\"947502d.jpg\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://www.mondaq.com/images/article_images/947502d.jpg\" width=\"241\" />\n<br />\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=9072179&amp;postID=8514218595893988289\" target=\"_blank\">\n</a>\n<br />\n</div>\n<p><a class=\"force\" href=\"http://www.mondaq.com/redirection.asp?article_id=947502&amp;company_id=8715&amp;redirectaddress=http%3A//thettablog.blogspot.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> The TTABlog</a></p>\n<p><em>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.
