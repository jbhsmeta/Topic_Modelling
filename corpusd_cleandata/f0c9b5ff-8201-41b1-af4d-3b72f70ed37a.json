    "text": "Infections spreading among health-care workers. Nursing home staffers fleeing\noutbreaks. Public health officials stationed at the airport to screen arriving\nvisitors.\n\nQuebec, which borders New York and three other U.S. states, is the Canadian\nprovince hit hardest by the coronavirus. Home to roughly 22 percent of the\ncountry's population, it has suffered more than 60 percent of its deaths.\n\nIt's also the province now moving most aggressively to reopen.\n\nEpidemiologists are unsure if cases in the French-speaking province have\npeaked. But retail businesses outside Montreal opened this month. So did\nelementary schools -- a step that provinces with zero current cases have not\nattempted. Construction and manufacturing resumed. Some businesses in Montreal\nreopen May 25. Dentists resume work next month.\n\nThe approach -- Quebec's top doctor described it as a \"weighted risk\" -- is\nbeing closely watched. Critics have called for more data before pushing ahead.\n\n\"My big concern is that we are starting a bit early,\" said Benoit Masse, a\nprofessor of public health at the University of Montreal. \"I think we should\nwait a bit.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a constituency in Montreal, said\nhe was \"worried\" for Quebecers.\n\n\"I understand how much people do want to go outside,\" he said this month. \"But\nwe need to do it in ways that we are sure are going to keep people safe.\"\n\nQuebec confirmed its first case in February, a month after Ontario and British\nColumbia. But it was the first to declare a public health emergency, and\nmobility data from Google showed residents were largely complying with orders\nto stay home and maintain social distance.\n\nNonetheless, the province has reported some 46,000 of the country's roughly\n84,000 cases, and 3,900 of its roughly 6,400 deaths.\n\nAnalysts offer several explanations for the outbreak's severity.\n\nQuebec's public school students took spring break during the first week of\nMarch, earlier than other provinces. Families decamped for Europe, Mexico and\nthe United States, where the virus was on the march.\n\nAt the time, public health officials in Canada said the threat posed by the\nvirus was \"low.\" By the time federal officials advised against nonessential\ntravel and sealed Canada's borders, most Quebecers had already returned to\nwork or school.\n\n\"If you're the virus, you cannot have chosen a better time to allow people to\ntravel,\" Masse said.\n\nIn mid-March, officials in Montreal were so concerned by what they said was\ninadequate screening by border agents that they deployed their own public\nhealth workers to airports to screen travelers.\n\nThe coronavirus quickly gained a foothold in the province's ill-prepared and\nlong-neglected long-term care homes. Caregivers, often lacking protective\ngear, worked at multiple facilities, increasing the opportunity for spread.\n\nAt one point, Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said the health-care system was\nmissing some 11,000 workers who were stricken with the virus or afraid to\nwork. Hospital staff have filled in, and the federal government agreed to send\nmore than 1,000 military troops to overwhelmed care homes. Some of them are\nnow sick, too.\n\nThe results have been calamitous. At the Residence Herron in Dorval, 31\nresidents died in less than one month. Some survivors had not been fed or\nchanged in days after some staffers abandoned the facility. At the Sainte-\nDorothee in Laval, at least 87 residents have died.\n\nLegault said he took \"full responsibility\" for the nursing home crisis, which\nis responsible for roughly 63 percent of Quebec's deaths from covid-19, the\ndisease caused by the novel coronavirus. Deaths in long-term care homes\naccount for 81 percent of Canada's deaths from the coronavirus, with the vast\nmajority occurring in Quebec and neighboring Ontario. Legault acknowledged\nfacilities were \"poorly equipped\" for a pandemic.\n\nThere are also hot spots outside long-term care homes, though analysts said\nthey might be related. In Montreal-Nord, the borough with the most coronavirus\ncases in the city, infected health-care workers make up 25 percent of cases.\nThe median income of the densely populated borough is roughly $16,800,\naccording to the 2016 Canadian Census.\n\nSome workers live in crowded quarters with multiple generations of family\nmembers, making isolation difficult and __ potentially hastening the virus's\nspread through the community.\n\n\"It's not like you can say, 'Most of the cases are happening in long-term care\nhomes or in hospitals, so we don't need to worry about what's happening in the\ncommunity,' \" said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of\nToronto. \"People move back and forth and interact.\"\n\nMontreal, with a metropolitan population of 4 million some 40 miles from the\nU.S. border, is the epicenter of Canada's outbreak, with more than one-quarter\nof the country's cases. Matthew Oughton, an infectious diseases specialist at\nthe city's Jewish General Hospital, said the virus's \"unfortunate predilection\nfor the vulnerable people in our social fabric\" has played a role. The city\nhas some of Canada's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nLegault said conditions there remain \"worrisome.\"\n\nWhen Quebec announced its reopening plan in April, Horacio Arruda, the\nprovince's top doctor, said new cases were inevitable but the goal was to keep\nthe number manageable. He said he hoped \"not too many people will die,\" and\nthat he would change course if necessary.\n\n\"We know that it's a risk. We cannot eliminate the virus,\" he said. \"It is\ncirculating. The question is, how do we do it? How do we balance things out?\"\n\nThe province has altered its pandemic response before. Initially, Legault\npushed the concept of \"herd immunity\" as he discussed plans to reopen schools,\nbefore backtracking. He twice delayed the reopening of schools in Montreal\nbefore canceling the rest of the school year last week.\n\nThe decision came after the province's public health institute released\nprojections indicating deaths could skyrocket to 150 per day in the greater\nMontreal area by July if all restrictions were lifted.\n\n\"It's hard to keep the entire province shut because of the hot spot in\nMontreal,\" Tuite said. \"The challenge is that Montreal is highly connected to\nthe rest of the province, and so there's a bit of a balancing act there.\"\n\nIn recent days, new cases and hospitalizations in Quebec have plateaued, but\nanalysts say it's too soon to tell whether they've peaked.\n\nCritics say more testing and contact tracing is needed before reopening the\neconomy. The province has not been able to administer the 14,000 tests per day\nthat officials __ promised, and some are concerned that areas that haven't\nexperienced outbreaks don't have the resources to identify and deal with them.\n\n\"I wish the government would err on the side of caution,\" said Kate Zinszer,\nan epidemiologist at the University of Montreal. \"My big worry is our capacity\nto respond as things degenerate.\"\n\nMona Nemer, Canada's chief science adviser, told Radio-Canada this month that\nshe had asked Quebec \"several times\" for its plan for widespread testing, but\nhad not seen one.\n\nArruda said he was not accountable to \"this lady,\" but to his bosses and the\npeople of Quebec. He then criticized the \"gerants d'estrades\" -- a phrase that\ntranslates loosely as \"back-seat drivers.\"\n\nMasse noted the tension between Ottawa and Quebec.\n\n\"When the federal government comes in and tells us what we should do, it\ndoesn't go too well,\" he __ said. \"But at some point, we had to call the army\nto help us, so you cannot have it both ways.\"\n\nHe added: \"I had the same question [as Nemer].\"\n\n[amanda.coletta@washpost.com](mailto:amanda.coletta@washpost.com)",

    "html": "<p />\n\n         <p>Infections spreading among health-care workers. Nursing home staffers fleeing outbreaks. Public health officials stationed at the airport to screen arriving visitors.</p>\n\n         <p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location>, which borders <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location> and three other <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> states, is the Canadian province hit hardest by the coronavirus. Home to roughly 22 percent of the country's population, it has suffered more than 60 percent of its deaths.</p>\n\n         <p>It's also the province now moving most aggressively to reopen.</p>\n\n         <p>Epidemiologists are unsure if cases in the French-speaking province have peaked. But retail businesses outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location> opened this month. So did elementary schools &#8212; a step that provinces with zero current cases have not attempted. Construction and manufacturing resumed. Some businesses in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location> reopen <chron>May 25</chron>. Dentists resume work next month.</p>\n\n         <p>The approach&#160;&#8212; <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec's</location> top doctor described it as a \"weighted risk\" &#8212; is being closely watched. Critics have called for more data before pushing ahead.</p>\n\n         <p>\"My big concern is that we are starting a bit early,\" said Beno&#238;t M&#226;sse, a professor of public health at the <org>University of Montreal</org>. \"I think we should wait a bit.\"</p>\n\n         <p>Prime Minister <person>Justin Trudeau</person>, who represents a constituency in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location>, said he was \"worried\" for Quebecers.</p>\n\n         <p>\"I understand how much people do want to go outside,\" he said this month. \"But we need to do it in ways that we are sure are going to keep people safe.\"</p>\n\n         <p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> confirmed its first case in February, a month after <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.on\">Ontario</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.bc\">British Columbia</location>. But it was the first to declare a public health emergency, and mobility data from Google showed residents were largely complying with orders to stay home and maintain social distance.</p>\n\n         <p>Nonetheless, the province has reported some  46,000 of the country's roughly 84,000 cases, and 3,900 of its roughly 6,400 deaths.</p>\n\n         <p>Analysts offer several explanations for the outbreak's severity.</p>\n\n         <p />\n\n         <p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec's</location> public school students took spring break during the first week of March, earlier than other provinces. Families decamped for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, where the virus was on the march.</p>\n\n         <p>At the time, public health officials in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> said the threat posed by the virus was \"low.\" By the time federal officials advised against nonessential travel and sealed <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada's</location> borders, most Quebecers had already returned to work or school.</p>\n\n         <p>\"If you're the virus, you cannot have chosen a better time to allow people to travel,\" M&#226;sse said.</p>\n\n         <p>In mid-March, officials in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location> were so concerned by what they said was inadequate screening by border agents that they deployed their own public health workers to airports to screen travelers.</p>\n\n         <p>The coronavirus quickly gained a foothold in the province's ill-prepared and long-neglected long-term care homes. Caregivers, often lacking protective gear, worked at multiple facilities, increasing the opportunity for spread.</p>\n\n         <p>At one point, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> Premier <person>Fran&#231;ois Legault</person> said the health-care system was missing some 11,000 workers who were stricken with the virus or afraid to work. Hospital staff have filled in, and the federal government agreed to send more than 1,000 military troops to overwhelmed care homes. Some of them are now sick, too.</p>\n\n         <p>The results have been calamitous. At the R&#233;sidence Herron in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.dorval\">Dorval</location>, 31 residents died in less than one month. Some survivors had not been fed or changed in days after some staffers abandoned the facility. At the Sainte-Doroth&#233;e&#160;in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.laval\">Laval</location>, at least 87 residents have died.</p>\n\n         <p />\n\n         <p>Legault said he took \"full responsibility\" for the nursing home crisis, which is responsible for roughly 63 percent of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec's</location> deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Deaths in long-term care homes account for 81&#8200;percent of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada's</location> deaths from the coronavirus, with the vast majority occurring in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> and neighboring <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.on\">Ontario</location>. Legault acknowledged facilities were \"poorly equipped\" for a pandemic.</p>\n\n         <p>There are also hot spots outside long-term care homes, though analysts said they might be related. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.monord\">Montreal-Nord</location>, the borough with the most coronavirus cases in the city, infected health-care workers make up 25 percent of cases. The median income of the densely populated borough is roughly <money>$16,800</money>, according to the 2016 Canadian Census.</p>\n\n         <p>Some workers live in crowded quarters with multiple generations of family members, making isolation difficult and<em>&#160;</em>\npotentially hastening the virus's spread through the community.</p>\n\n         <p>\"It's not like you can say, 'Most of the cases are happening in long-term care homes or in hospitals, so we don't need to worry about what's happening in the community,'&#8201;\" said <person>Ashleigh Tuite</person>, an epidemiologist at the <org>University of Toronto</org>. \"People move back and forth and interact.\"</p>\n\n         <p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location>, with a metropolitan population of 4 million some 40&#8200;miles from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> border, is the epicenter of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada's</location> outbreak, with more than one-quarter of the country's cases. <person>Matthew Oughton</person>, an infectious diseases specialist at the city's <org>Jewish General Hospital</org>, said the virus's \"unfortunate predilection for the vulnerable people in our social fabric\" has played a role. The city&#160;has some of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada's</location> poorest neighborhoods.</p>\n\n         <p>Legault said conditions there remain \"worrisome.\"</p>\n\n         <p>When <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> announced its reopening plan in April, <person>Horacio Arruda</person>, the province's top doctor, said new cases were inevitable but the goal was to keep the number manageable. He said he hoped \"not too many people will die,\" and that he would change course if necessary.</p>\n\n         <p>\"We know that it's a risk. We cannot eliminate the virus,\" he said. \"It is circulating. The question is, how do we do it? How do we balance things out?\"</p>\n\n         <p>The province has altered its pandemic response before. Initially, Legault pushed the concept of \"herd immunity\" as he discussed plans to reopen schools, before backtracking. He twice delayed the reopening of schools in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location> before canceling the rest of the school year last week.</p>\n\n         <p />\n\n         <p>The decision came after the province's public health institute released projections indicating deaths could skyrocket to 150 per day in the greater <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location> area by July if all restrictions were lifted.</p>\n\n         <p>\"It's hard to keep the entire province shut because of the hot spot in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location>,\" Tuite said. \"The challenge is that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location> is highly connected to the rest of the province, and so there's a bit of a balancing act there.\"</p>\n\n         <p>In recent&#160;days, new cases and hospitalizations in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> have plateaued, but analysts say it's too soon to tell whether they've peaked.</p>\n\n         <p>Critics say more testing and contact tracing is needed before reopening the economy. The province has not been able to administer the 14,000 tests per day that officials<em>&#160;</em>\npromised, and some are concerned that areas that haven't experienced outbreaks don't have the resources to identify and deal with them.</p>\n\n         <p>\"I wish the government would err on the side of caution,\" said <person>Kate Zinszer</person>, an epidemiologist at the <org>University of Montreal</org>. \"My big worry is our capacity to respond as things degenerate.\"</p>\n\n         <p><person>Mona Nemer</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada's</location> chief science adviser, told Radio-Canada this month that she had asked <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location> \"several times\" for its plan for widespread testing, but had not seen one.</p>\n\n         <p>Arruda said he was not accountable to \"this lady,\" but to his bosses and the people of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location>. He then criticized the \"g&#233;rants d'estrades\" &#8212; a phrase that translates loosely as \"back-seat drivers.\"</p>\n\n         <p>M&#226;sse noted the tension between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.ottawa\">Ottawa</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.qc\">Quebec</location>.</p>\n\n         <p>\"When the federal government comes in and tells us what we should do, it doesn't go too well,\" he<em>&#160;</em>\nsaid. \"But at some point, we had to call the army to help us, so you cannot have it both ways.\"</p>\n\n         <p>He added: \"I had the same question [as Nemer].\"</p>\n\n         <p><p><a href=\"mailto:amanda.coletta@washpost.com\">amanda.coletta@washpost.com</a></p></p>",
