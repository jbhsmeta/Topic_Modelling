    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily\nNews \\-- Current study results on water science and technology have been\npublished. According to news originating from Lulea, Sweden, by NewsRx\ncorrespondents, research stated, \"The study of evaporation and freezing of\ndroplets is important in, e.g., spray cooling, surface coating, ink-jet\nprinting, and when dealing with icing on wind turbines, airplane wings, and\nroads.\"\n\nThe news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Lulea University\nof Technology: \"Due to the complex nature of the flow within droplets, a wide\nrange of temperatures, from freezing temperatures to heating temperatures,\nhave to be taken into account in order to increase the understanding of the\nflow behavior. This study aimed to reveal if natural convection and/or\nMarangoni convection influence the flow in freezing and evaporating droplets.\nDroplets were released on cold and warm surfaces using similar experimental\ntechniques and setups, and the internal flow within freezing and evaporating\nwater droplets were then investigated and compared to one another using\nParticle Image Velocimetry. It was shown that, for both freezing and\nevaporating droplets, a shift in flow direction occurs early in the processes.\nFor the freezing droplets, this effect could be traced to the Marangoni\nconvection, but this could not be concluded for the evaporating droplets. For\nboth evaporating and freezing droplets, after the shift in flow direction,\nnatural convection dominates the flow.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In the end of the\nfreezing process, conduction seems to be the only contributing factor for the\nflow.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Comparing Internal Flow in Freezing\nand Evaporating Water Droplets Using PIV. _Water_ , 2020,12(1489):1489.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Ecology Daily News</org> -- Current study results on water science and technology have been published. According to news originating from Lulea, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/se\">Sweden</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;The study of evaporation and freezing of droplets is important in, e.g., spray cooling, surface coating, ink-jet printing, and when dealing with icing on wind turbines, airplane wings, and roads.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from <org>Lulea University</org> of Technology: &#8220;Due to the complex nature of the flow within droplets, a wide range of temperatures, from freezing temperatures to heating temperatures, have to be taken into account in order to increase the understanding of the flow behavior. This study aimed to reveal if natural convection and/or Marangoni convection influence the flow in freezing and evaporating droplets. Droplets were released on cold and warm surfaces using similar experimental techniques and setups, and the internal flow within freezing and evaporating water droplets were then investigated and compared to one another using Particle Image Velocimetry. It was shown that, for both freezing and evaporating droplets, a shift in flow direction occurs early in the processes. For the freezing droplets, this effect could be traced to the Marangoni convection, but this could not be concluded for the evaporating droplets. For both evaporating and freezing droplets, after the shift in flow direction, natural convection dominates the flow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;In the end of the freezing process, conduction seems to be the only contributing factor for the flow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Comparing Internal Flow in Freezing and Evaporating Water Droplets Using PIV. <em>Water</em>, 2020,12(1489):1489.
