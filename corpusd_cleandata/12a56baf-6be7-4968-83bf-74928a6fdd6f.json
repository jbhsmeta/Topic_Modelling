    "text": "Temperatures soared 10 degrees Celsius above average last month in Siberia,\nhome to much of Earth's permafrost, as the world experienced its hottest May\non record, the European Union's climate monitoring network said Friday.\n\nThe Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said May 2020 was 0.68C warmer\nthan the average May from 1981 to 2010, with above average temperatures across\nparts of Alaska, Europe, North America, South America, swathes of Africa and\nAntarctica.\n\nGlobally, \"the average temperature for the twelve months to May 2020 is close\nto 1.3C above the (pre-industrial) level\", Copernicus said referring to the\nbenchmark by which global warming is often measured.\n\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries have pledged to cap the\nrise in Earth average surface temperature to \"well below\" 2C, and to 1.5C if\npossible.\n\nThe heatwave across parts of Siberia and Alaska will cause particular alarm in\nregions that were engulfed by huge forest fires last year fuelled by record\nheat, and where Copernicus has warned that \"zombie\" blazes smouldering\nunderground may be reigniting.\n\nThe monitoring network said that there were \"highly anomalous\" temperatures\nover Siberia throughout the March to May period.\n\n\\- Carbon in the permafrost -\n\nThese reached close to 10C above the 1981 to 2010 average over parts of the Ob\nand Yenisei rivers, where \"record-early break-up of river ice has been\nreported\".\n\nCopernicus recorded above average temperatures around much of the Arctic\nbetween March to May, although the spring was colder in northern Canada.\n\nParts of Europe \\-- from the Balkans to Scandinavia -- also saw cooler than\naverage temperatures in May, as did Australia, southern Asia and eastern\nUnited States.\n\nThe 12 months to May were 0.7C hotter than the 1981 to 2010 average, matching\nthe warmest equivalent period on record, between October 2015 and September\n2016.\n\nOverall, global temperatures have risen more than one degree Celsius since\nmid-19th century levels, driven mostly by the burning fossil fuels.\n\nThere has been a sustained period of above-average temperatures since 2002,\nwhile the last five years have been the hottest on record, as was the last\ndecade.\n\nIn the Arctic region average temperatures have risen by two degrees Celsius\nsince the mid-19th century, almost twice the global average.\n\nThis has accelerated melting of Greenland's kilometres-thick ice sheet,\nresulting in a net loss of 600 billion tonnes of ice mass for the year --\naccounting for about 40 percent of total sea level rise in 2019.\n\nThe permafrost in Russian and Canadian forests contains as much as 1.5\ntrillion tonnes of carbon dioxide -- around 40 times current annual emissions.\n\nThe United Nations said last year that manmade greenhouse gas emissions needed\nto tumble 7.6 percent annually over the next decade to cap global warming at\n1.5C.\n\nCurrent pledges to cut emissions put Earth on a path of several degrees\nwarming by the end of the century.\n\nklm/mh/lc",
