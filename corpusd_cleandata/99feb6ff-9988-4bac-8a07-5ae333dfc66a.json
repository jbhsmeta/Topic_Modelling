    "text": "Pep Hamilton hasn't wasted any time getting to know the Chargers' next face of\nthe franchise and eventual successor to Philip Rivers.\n\nThis, of course, is Justin Herbert, whom the Chargers drafted with the sixth\noverall pick in last month's NFL draft. Perhaps it's not fair to label a\nrookie quarterback as a \"face of a franchise,\" but that's what many expect\nfrom him in the years to come, and Hamilton was hired to guide Herbert to that\nesteemed status.\n\nThere's plenty of pressure on the Chargers' new quarterbacks coach, but you\ncouldn't tell from Wednesday's introductory Zoom call. The easygoing Hamilton\nbantered with reporters and poked fun at one's quarantine mustache (this\nreporter).\n\n\"Is that a real mustache?\" Hamilton asked. \"What was your question again?\"\n\nThe question: How tough is it to balance a quarterback competition while\ntrying to groom a first-round quarterback at the same time?\n\nHerbert will compete with veteran quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who's been\nreferred to by Chargers coach Anthony Lynn as being in the driver's seat to\nstart.\n\nHamilton, 45, wasn't stalling to answer the question. He's seen all types of\nquarterback battles dating back to his first coaching gig as Howard's\nquarterbacks coach in 1997, one year after playing quarterback for the\nuniversity. Hamilton has coached for the New York Jets, San Francisco 49ers,\nChicago Bears and Cleveland Browns.\n\nHe was instrumental in the development of former star quarterback Andrew Luck\nas an assistant coach at Stanford and with the Indianapolis Colts. Hamilton\nwas Luck's offensive coordinator from 2013 to 2015.\n\nSo back to the question.\n\n\"I don't know that it's necessarily a tough thing to do,\" Hamilton said. \"I\nthink whenever we get on the field, I think guys are going to organically\nseparate themselves. I do think that football is such that when given the\nopportunity to go out and play, and play at a level that's going to give our\nteam a chance to win games, it shows through reps and it shows in time.\"\n\nHamilton and the Chargers don't plan on rushing Herbert's development, but\nthey're expecting the former Oregon quarterback to push Taylor for the\nstarting gig.\n\n\"They are different players,\" Hamilton said when asked if there are any\nsimilarities between Herbert and Luck. \"But you know, I think the one thing\nthat they have in common is the fact that they were drafted with the\nexpectation of being able to come in and play at a high level whenever they\nget the opportunity to play. So we're preparing Justin to be ready to come in\nand compete to play from Day 1.\"\n\nHamilton, who was officially hired this month, hasn't worked with Herbert in\nperson, but he's gotten to know him virtually, saying the two have had many\nfootball conversations that have gone into the wee hours of the night.\n\n\"Smart kid,\" Hamilton said of Herbert. \"Very smart. Football is important to\nhim.  I'm excited to see that he's a student of the game.\"\n\nHamilton hasn't coached in the NFL since 2016. He was an assistant head coach\nat Michigan for two seasons and was the general manager and head coach of the\nXFL's DC Defenders for five games before the startup league folded in April.\n\nHamilton wasn't unemployed for long. He has another coaching gig, one with\nplenty of pressure, but that's nothing new to him.\n\nCHARGERS REOPEN FACILITY\n\nThe Chargers reopened their facility Tuesday with only a few executives\nallowed inside the Costa Mesa building.\n\nThey plan to slowly allow more people inside the facility in the coming days\nwhile following all safety guidelines. NFL facilities were closed two months\nago because of the coronavirus pandemic and were allowed to reopen last week.\n\nThe next phase would be to allow players and coaches inside the building and\neventually on the practice field, but there's no telling when that time will\ncome.\n\nRight tackle Bryan Bulaga, the Chargers' free-agent acquisition, has spent his\noffseason in Florida. Bulaga said he's planning to gradually move into his new\nLos Angeles home in the next few weeks.\n\nBulaga is itching to meet his new teammates in person, but he's skeptical\nabout potentially jumping into a mandatory minicamp next month if the league\nand the state allows it.\n\n\"I don't think we can just go out there for a week of minicamp and do it how\nwe normally do it,\" Bulaga said. \"Put on helmets and fly around and do that. I\ndon't see how that's possible. I think there's health risk involved there, not\ncoronavirus health, but with guys' bodies; hamstrings, knees.\n\n\"We haven't done any football movements and then you're going to put us in\nfront of each other and then say, 'Hey, go at it.' I don't know if that's\ngoing to work out, but I can see it more of a jog through tempo. More teaching\nthan actually live speed.\"\n\nHARRIS' FRESH START\n\nFirst-year Chargers cornerback Chris Harris Jr. was named to the league's\n2010s All-Decade Team in April. That's one of many awards Harris earned during\nhis nine seasons with the Denver Broncos.\n\nHarris, 30, is hoping a fresh start with the Chargers will lead to more\nawards, including the prestigious Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Last year, there was a lot of stuff going on with me,\" Harris said about his\nfinal year with the Broncos, which included trade rumors. \"Mentally, you never\nknow how stuff wears down on you. I think it just did. Naturally as a human it\ndid. Going into this year, I feel so happy. I got a clear mind and I'm hungry.\nI'm not done. I got a lot of goals I want to achieve. I want to be in the Hall\nof Fame. I want to continue to get Pro Bowls and All-Pros.\"\n\nBefore the rocky ending, the Broncos signed Harris as an undrafted free agent\nin 2011 out of the University of Kansas. He made four Pro Bowls, one First-\nTeam All-Pro, two Second-Team All-Pros and won Super Bowl 50.\n\nThere was plenty of good for Harris in Denver, a stint that started with\nChargers defensive backs coach Ron Milus grooming the undrafted free agent.\nMilus held the same position in Denver and coached Harris from 2011 to 2012.\n\n\"Always play that slot (cornerback position),\" Harris recalled what Milus told\nhim in Denver. \"He said that's my spot. That's one thing he told me. He said,\n'Whatever you do, if you can play outside or safety, always try to play that\nslot.' He said I'm one of the best at it.\"\n\nOne of the Chargers' intriguing offseason storylines is where Harris and\nDesmond King will line up in the secondary this season. King was named First-\nTeam All-Pro as a slot cornerback in 2018.",

    "title": "Chargers hire Pep Hamilton to groom Justin Herbert, but no pressure",
    "html": "<p><person>Pep Hamilton</person> hasn't wasted any time getting to know the Chargers' next face of the franchise and eventual successor to <person>Philip Rivers</person>.</p>\n<p>This, of course, is <person>Justin Herbert</person>, whom the Chargers drafted with the sixth overall pick in last month's <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> draft. Perhaps it's not fair to label a rookie quarterback as a \"face of a franchise,\" but that's what many expect from him in the years to come, and Hamilton was hired to guide Herbert to that esteemed status.</p>\n\n<p>There's plenty of pressure on the Chargers' new quarterbacks coach, but you couldn't tell from Wednesday's introductory Zoom call. The easygoing Hamilton bantered with reporters and poked fun at one's quarantine mustache (this reporter).</p>\n\n<p>\"Is that a real mustache?\" Hamilton asked. \"What was your question again?\"</p>\n\n<p>The question: How tough is it to balance a quarterback competition while trying to groom a first-round quarterback at the same time?</p>\n\n<p>Herbert will compete with veteran quarterback <person>Tyrod Taylor</person>, who's been referred to by Chargers coach <person>Anthony Lynn</person> as being in the driver's seat to start.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton, 45, wasn't stalling to answer the question. He's seen all types of quarterback battles dating back to his first coaching gig as Howard's quarterbacks coach in 1997, one year after playing quarterback for the university. Hamilton has coached for the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131521\">New York Jets</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131548\">San Francisco 49ers</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131540\">Chicago Bears</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131526\">Cleveland Browns</org>.</p>\n\n<p>He was instrumental in the development of former star quarterback <person>Andrew Luck</person> as an assistant coach at <org>Stanford</org> and with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131527\">Indianapolis Colts</org>. Hamilton was Luck's offensive coordinator from 2013 to 2015.</p>\n\n<p>So back to the question.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't know that it's necessarily a tough thing to do,\" Hamilton said. \"I think whenever we get on the field, I think guys are going to organically separate themselves. I do think that football is such that when given the opportunity to go out and play, and play at a level that's going to give our team a chance to win games, it shows through reps and it shows in time.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton and the Chargers don't plan on rushing Herbert's development, but they're expecting the former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.or\">Oregon</location> quarterback to push Taylor for the starting gig.</p>\n\n<p>\"They are different players,\" Hamilton said when asked if there are any similarities between Herbert and Luck. \"But you know, I think the one thing that they have in common is the fact that they were drafted with the expectation of being able to come in and play at a high level whenever they get the opportunity to play. So we're preparing Justin to be ready to come in and compete to play from Day 1.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton, who was officially hired this month, hasn't worked with Herbert in person, but he's gotten to know him virtually, saying the two have had many football conversations that have gone into the wee hours of the night.</p>\n\n<p>\"Smart kid,\" Hamilton said of Herbert. \"Very smart. Football is important to him. &#133; I'm excited to see that he's a student of the game.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton hasn't coached in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> since 2016. He was an assistant head coach at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location> for two seasons and was the general manager and head coach of the XFL's DC Defenders for five games before the startup league folded in April.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton wasn't unemployed for long. He has another coaching gig, one with plenty of pressure, but that's nothing new to him.</p>\n\n<p>CHARGERS REOPEN FACILITY</p>\n\n<p>The Chargers reopened their facility Tuesday with only a few executives allowed inside the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.cosesa\">Costa Mesa</location> building.</p>\n\n<p>They plan to slowly allow more people inside the facility in the coming days while following all safety guidelines. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> facilities were closed two months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic and were allowed to reopen last week.</p>\n\n<p>The next phase would be to allow players and coaches inside the building and eventually on the practice field, but there's no telling when that time will come.</p>\n\n<p>Right tackle <person>Bryan Bulaga</person>, the Chargers' free-agent acquisition, has spent his offseason in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>. Bulaga said he's planning to gradually move into his new <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.losang\">Los Angeles</location> home in the next few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Bulaga is itching to meet his new teammates in person, but he's skeptical about potentially jumping into a mandatory minicamp next month if the league and the state allows it.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think we can just go out there for a week of minicamp and do it how we normally do it,\" Bulaga said. \"Put on helmets and fly around and do that. I don't see how that's possible. I think there's health risk involved there, not coronavirus health, but with guys' bodies; hamstrings, knees.</p>\n\n<p>\"We haven't done any football movements and then you're going to put us in front of each other and then say, 'Hey, go at it.' I don't know if that's going to work out, but I can see it more of a jog through tempo. More teaching than actually live speed.\"</p>\n\n<p>HARRIS' FRESH START</p>\n\n<p>First-year Chargers cornerback <person>Chris Harris Jr</person>. was named to the league's 2010s All-Decade Team in April. That's one of many awards Harris earned during his nine seasons with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131532\">Denver Broncos</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Harris, 30, is hoping a fresh start with the Chargers will lead to more awards, including the prestigious Hall of Fame.</p>\n\n<p>\"Last year, there was a lot of stuff going on with me,\" Harris said about his final year with the Broncos, which included trade rumors. \"Mentally, you never know how stuff wears down on you. I think it just did. Naturally as a human it did. Going into this year, I feel so happy. I got a clear mind and I'm hungry. I'm not done. I got a lot of goals I want to achieve. I want to be in the Hall of Fame. I want to continue to get Pro Bowls and All-Pros.\"</p>\n\n<p>Before the rocky ending, the Broncos signed Harris as an undrafted free agent in 2011 out of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2736489599\">University of Kansas</org>. He made four Pro Bowls, one First-Team All-Pro, two Second-Team All-Pros and won <org>Super Bowl</org> 50.</p>\n\n<p>There was plenty of good for Harris in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>, a stint that started with Chargers defensive backs coach <person>Ron Milus</person> grooming the undrafted free agent. Milus held the same position in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location> and coached Harris from 2011 to 2012.</p>\n\n<p>\"Always play that slot (cornerback position),\" Harris recalled what Milus told him in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>. \"He said that's my spot. That's one thing he told me. He said, 'Whatever you do, if you can play outside or safety, always try to play that slot.' He said I'm one of the best at it.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of the Chargers' intriguing offseason storylines is where Harris and <person>Desmond King</person> will line up in the secondary this season. King was named First-Team All-Pro as a slot cornerback in 2018.</p>",
