    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily India\nReport -- Current study results on Developmental Diseases and Conditions -\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders have been published. According to\nnews reporting from Bangalore, India, by NewsRx editors, the research stated,\n\"In observational studies, significant associations have often been identified\nbetween antidepressant drug prescription during pregnancy, on the one hand,\nand autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), on the other. Interpreting these associations is problematic\nbecause they are based on analyses that could not adjust for inadequately\nmeasured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds.\"\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the National\nInstitute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), \"Recent clinical data\nsuggest that a genetic relationship exists between depression and\nneurodevelopmental disorders. A very recent study identified many genetic loci\nthat were common to depression, ASD, and ADHD. These findings suggest the\npossibility that depression in a pregnant woman may predispose to\nneurodevelopmental disorders in offspring through shared genes and not through\nantidepressant use during pregnancy. Previous studies that significantly\nassociated gestational exposure to antidepressants with adverse pregnancy\noutcomes could not adjust for genetic factors because they were unknown\nconfounds at the time. Now that common risk loci have been identified, at\nleast some of the unknown (genetic) confounds are no longer unknown; however,\nunless specifically examined in prospective studies, they will remain as\nunmeasured confounds that will continue to compromise the interpretation of\nstudy results. The possibility of confounding by inadequately measured,\nunmeasured, and unknown risk factors must therefore be considered before\nindicting antidepressant use during pregnancy in neurodevelopmental risks.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In this context, the\nimportance of genetic factors as unmeasured and unknown confounds must be\nacknowledged.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Genes as Unmeasured and Unknown\nConfounds in Studies of Neurodevelopmental Outcomes After Antidepressant\nPrescription During Pregnancy. _The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry_ ,\n2020;81(3):.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting C. Andrade, Dept. of Psychopharmacology, National Institute of\nMental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India.\n\nThe direct object identifier (DOI) for that additional information is:\n<https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.20f13463>.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at Daily India Report -- Current study results on Developmental Diseases and Conditions - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders have been published. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/in..bangal\">Bangalore, India</location>, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, &#8220;In observational studies, significant associations have often been identified between antidepressant drug prescription during pregnancy, on the one hand, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), on the other. Interpreting these associations is problematic because they are based on analyses that could not adjust for inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2597949542\">National Institute of Mental Health</org> and <org>Neurosciences</org> (NIMHANS), &#8220;Recent clinical data suggest that a genetic relationship exists between depression and neurodevelopmental disorders. A very recent study identified many genetic loci that were common to depression, ASD, and ADHD. These findings suggest the possibility that depression in a pregnant woman may predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring through shared genes and not through antidepressant use during pregnancy. Previous studies that significantly associated gestational exposure to antidepressants with adverse pregnancy outcomes could not adjust for genetic factors because they were unknown confounds at the time. Now that common risk loci have been identified, at least some of the unknown (genetic) confounds are no longer unknown; however, unless specifically examined in prospective studies, they will remain as unmeasured confounds that will continue to compromise the interpretation of study results. The possibility of confounding by inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown risk factors must therefore be considered before indicting antidepressant use during pregnancy in neurodevelopmental risks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;In this context, the importance of genetic factors as unmeasured and unknown confounds must be acknowledged.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Genes as Unmeasured and Unknown Confounds in Studies of Neurodevelopmental Outcomes After Antidepressant Prescription During Pregnancy. <em><org>The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</org></em>, 2020;81(3):.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>C.
