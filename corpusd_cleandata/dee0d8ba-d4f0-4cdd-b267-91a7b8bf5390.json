    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology\nBusiness Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from Alexandria,\nVirginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventor Jang, Dong Sik\n(Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea), filed on April 26, 2019, was published\nonline on June 8, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent, patent number 10,663,854, is SK Hynix Inc.\n(Gyeonggi-do, South Korea).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Various embodiments of the present disclosure\nrelate to a method of fabricating a photomask.\n\n\"Highly integrated semiconductor devices exhibit improved operation speed and\nlower power consumption. Various advanced process technologies have been\nproposed for reducing the minimum feature size of circuit patterns, such as\ninterconnection patterns, and contact hole patterns employed for electrically\nconnecting the interconnection patterns. For example, various advanced\nphotolithography technologies have been used for forming fine patterns.\nGenerally, photolithography processes employ photomasks, exposure apparatuses\nand resist materials all of which are important in minimizing the size of the\ncircuit patterns.\n\n\"Generally, forming accurate photomask patterns on a mask substrate require to\naccurately pattern a resist layer of a photomask blank. Generally, a phase\nshift photomask blank may include a phase shifting layer, a light blocking\nlayer and a resist layer which are stacked sequentially on a substrate.\nTypically, the resist layer is patterned for forming resist patterns, whereas\nthe light blocking and the phase shifting layers are patterned using the\nresist patterns for forming light blocking patterns and phase shifting\npatterns, respectively. In such a case, the pitch sizes of the light blocking\npatterns and the phase shifting patterns are determined by the pitch size of\nthe resist patterns. The resist patterns may act as etch buffers or etch masks\nwhile an etch process for patterning the light blocking layer is performed.\nThus, according to existing processes, the resist layer should be formed to\nhave at least a sufficient thickness for accommodating the above processes.\nIncreasing the thickness of the resist layer generally may improve the\naccuracy of the light blocking and the phase shifting patterns, however, it\nmay make it more difficult to accurately pattern the resist layer.\nAccordingly, it is generally difficult to form accurate light blocking and\nphase shifting patterns.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors\nalso obtained the inventor's summary information for this patent: \"Various\nembodiments are directed to methods of fabricating photomasks.\n\n\"According to an embodiment, there is provided a method of fabricating a\nphotomask. The method includes providing a photomask blank having a phase\nshifting layer, a first light blocking layer, a first resist layer, a second\nlight blocking layer and a second resist layer which are stacked sequentially\nin this order on a substrate. The second resist patterns are formed by\npatterning the second resist layer. The second light blocking patterns are\nformed by patterning the second light blocking layer using an etch process\nemploying the second resist patterns as etch masks. The first resist patterns\nare formed by patterning the first resist layer using an etch process\nemploying the second light blocking patterns as etch masks. The first light\nblocking patterns and the phase shifting patterns are formed by patterning the\nfirst light blocking layer and the phase shifting patterns by patterning the\nfirst light blocking layer and the phase shifting layer using an etch process\nemploying the first resist patterns as etch masks. The first resist patterns\nare then removed. At least one of the first light blocking patterns is\nselectively removed. The second resist layer has a thickness such that all of\nthe second resist layer is removed while the first resist layer is patterned\nfor exposing the second light blocking layer.\n\n\"According to other embodiment, there is provided a method of fabricating a\nphotomask. The method includes providing a photomask blank having a first\nlight blocking layer, a first resist layer, a second light blocking layer and\na second resist layer which are stacked sequentially on a substrate. The\nsecond resist patterns are formed by patterning the second resist layer. The\nsecond light blocking patterns are formed by patterning the second light\nblocking layer using an etch process employing the second resist patterns as\netch masks. The first resist patterns are formed by patterning the first\nresist layer using an etch process employing the second light blocking\npatterns as etch masks. The first light blocking patterns by patterning the\nfirst light blocking layer using an etch process employing the first resist\npatterns as etch masks. The first resist patterns are then removed. The second\nresist layer has a thickness such that all of the second resist layer is\nremoved while the first resist layer is patterned for exposing the second\nlight blocking layer.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"What is claimed is:\n\n\"1\\.

Various advanced process technologies have been proposed for reducing the minimum feature size of circuit patterns, such as interconnection patterns, and contact hole patterns employed for electrically connecting the interconnection patterns. For example, various advanced photolithography technologies have been used for forming fine patterns. Generally, photolithography processes employ photomasks, exposure apparatuses and resist materials all of which are important in minimizing the size of the circuit patterns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Generally, forming accurate photomask patterns on a mask substrate require to accurately pattern a resist layer of a photomask blank. Generally, a phase shift photomask blank may include a phase shifting layer, a light blocking layer and a resist layer which are stacked sequentially on a substrate. Typically, the resist layer is patterned for forming resist patterns, whereas the light blocking and the phase shifting layers are patterned using the resist patterns for forming light blocking patterns and phase shifting patterns, respectively. In such a case, the pitch sizes of the light blocking patterns and the phase shifting patterns are determined by the pitch size of the resist patterns. The resist patterns may act as etch buffers or etch masks while an etch process for patterning the light blocking layer is performed. Thus, according to existing processes, the resist layer should be formed to have at least a sufficient thickness for accommodating the above processes. Increasing the thickness of the resist layer generally may improve the accuracy of the light blocking and the phase shifting patterns, however, it may make it more difficult to accurately pattern the resist layer. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to form accurate light blocking and phase shifting patterns.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent: &#8220;Various embodiments are directed to methods of fabricating photomasks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to an embodiment, there is provided a method of fabricating a photomask. The method includes providing a photomask blank having a phase shifting layer, a first light blocking layer, a first resist layer, a second light blocking layer and a second resist layer which are stacked sequentially in this order on a substrate. The second resist patterns are formed by patterning the second resist layer. The second light blocking patterns are formed by patterning the second light blocking layer using an etch process employing the second resist patterns as etch masks. The first resist patterns are formed by patterning the first resist layer using an etch process employing the second light blocking patterns as etch masks. The first light blocking patterns and the phase shifting patterns are formed by patterning the first light blocking layer and the phase shifting patterns by patterning the first light blocking layer and the phase shifting layer using an etch process employing the first resist patterns as etch masks. The first resist patterns are then removed. At least one of the first light blocking patterns is selectively removed. The second resist layer has a thickness such that all of the second resist layer is removed while the first resist layer is patterned for exposing the second light blocking layer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to other embodiment, there is provided a method of fabricating a photomask.
