    "text": "Rose Mary Hawkins, 84, of Oak Hill, West Virginia, passed away peacefully May\n28, 2020, due to complications of a longtime illness. She was born February\n29, 1936, in Vinton, Virginia, to Reece and Sallie Altice. She married the\nlove of her life, her sunshine, Riley Hawkins, in 1954, who preceded her in\ndeath in 2014 after 60 years of marriage.\n\nShe was a woman of God who defined the word faith. She had enough faith to\nhold together her whole family and will continue to in the coming days. She\nwas a member of Page Baptist Church, where she attended faithfully with a\nservant's heart.\n\nRose loved to love on people. She loved to feed people. Nothing meant more to\nher than family and you never left her house without a full stomach and lots\nof hugs and kisses. Known to so many as Mamaw Rose, we will never forget her\ngorgeous smile and contagious laugh. She loved working in her flower beds and\nsurrounding her home with beautiful flowers.\n\nShe was the current owner of Mountain Vending and worked in two plastic\nfactories in her lifetime, but her passion was found in food service. She was\nthe owner/operator of several local restaurants including Nevas Nook, Roses\nSandwich Shop, Mamaw Roses, Riley's Cafe along with multiple food trucks. She\nstood by her husband and helped build Mountain Vending, which would go on to\nbe one of the largest independently owned companies in WV.\n\nRose was survived by her beloved children Larry Hawkins Sr. and wife Sherry,\nDebbie Sizemore, Jeff Hawkins and wife Kathy and Mark Hawkins and fiance Renea\nPittman. Grandchildren Larry Wayne Hawkins Jr. and wife Brooke, Robert\nSizemore and wife Temper, Timmy Sizemore and fiance Wendy, Josh Hawkins and\nwife Angela, Adam Sizemore and companion Cassandra, Luke Pittman, and Jennifer\nO'Dell and companion Trista Roles, along with 14 great grandchildren. Sisters\nBarabara Tolly, Rachel Robertison and Ruth Baker and brother Pete Altice and\nwife Diane. Sisters-in-law Joyce Early, Kathy Hawkins, Sue Cole, June Arthur.\nRose had a large extended family through Paige Baptist Church and the\nemployees of Mountain Vending.\n\nRose's life was a living example of Ephesians 4:32 - \"And be kind and\ncompassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave\nyou in Christ.\" The family would like to extend their deepest gratitude to the\nstaff of the ER and SICU at Raleigh General Hospital for the care and\ncompassion shown to Rose and her family.\n\nServices will be held on Tuesday, June 2, at High Lawn Memorial Park in Oak\nHill. Family Visitation from 11-12, Public from 12-2 with funeral services at\ngraveside at High Lawn Memorial Park at 2pm. Services will be conducted by Ron\nMoore. Grandchildren will serve as pallbearers. Family requests in lieu of\nflowers, donations be made to Page Baptist Church, Kinkaid, West Virginia.",

She was born <chron>February 29, 1936</chron>, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.vinton\">Vinton, Virginia</location>, to Reece and <person>Sallie Altice</person>. She married the love of her life, her sunshine, <person>Riley Hawkins</person>, in 1954, who preceded her in death in 2014 after 60 years of marriage.</p>\n<p>She was a woman of God who defined the word faith. She had enough faith to hold together her whole family and will continue to in the coming days. She was a member of <org>Page Baptist Church</org>, where she attended faithfully with a servant's heart.</p>\n\n<p>Rose loved to love on people. She loved to feed people. Nothing meant more to her than family and you never left her house without a full stomach and lots of hugs and kisses. Known to so many as Mamaw Rose, we will never forget her gorgeous smile and contagious laugh. She loved working in her flower beds and surrounding her home with beautiful flowers.</p>\n\n<p>She was the current owner of Mountain Vending and worked in two plastic factories in her lifetime, but her passion was found in food service. She was the owner/operator of several local restaurants including Nevas Nook, <org>Roses Sandwich Shop</org>, Mamaw Roses, Riley's Caf&#233; along with multiple food trucks. She stood by her husband and helped build Mountain Vending, which would go on to be one of the largest independently owned companies in WV.</p>\n\n<p>Rose was survived by her beloved children <person>Larry Hawkins Sr</person>. and wife Sherry, <person>Debbie Sizemore</person>, <person>Jeff Hawkins</person> and wife Kathy and <person>Mark Hawkins</person> and fianc&#233; <person>Renea Pittman</person>.

Sisters-in-law <person>Joyce Early</person>, <person>Kathy Hawkins</person>, <person>Sue Cole</person>, <person>June Arthur</person>. Rose had a large extended family through <org>Paige Baptist Church</org> and the employees of Mountain Vending.</p>\n\n<p>Rose's life was a living example of Ephesians 4:32 - \"And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ.\" The family would like to extend their deepest gratitude to the staff of the ER and SICU at <org>Raleigh General Hospital</org> for the care and compassion shown to Rose and her family.</p>\n\n<p>Services will be held on <chron>Tuesday, June 2</chron>, at <location>High Lawn Memorial Park</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wv.oakill\">Oak Hill</location>.
