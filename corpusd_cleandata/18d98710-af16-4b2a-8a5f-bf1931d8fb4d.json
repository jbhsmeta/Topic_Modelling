    "text": "Paper calendars and the Volstead Act contributed to the closing of the Ithaca\nCalendar Clock Company in 1918, according to a history written on the\ncompany's website found at www.ithacacalendar\n\n[clockcompany.com](http://clockcompany.com)\n\nThe company was founded by Henry B. Horton (b. 1819, d. 1885) and produced the\npopular Ithaca Calendar Clock, unique for its accuracy and its ability to work\nthrough a leap year.\n\nOne such clock hangs in the parlor at the McMinn County Living Heritage\nMuseum. It has two circular faces set in a decorative wooden case. The face on\nthe top gives the time and the bottom one gives the day of the week, the date\nand the month of the year.\n\nThe company was founded by Horton in 1865 after he tried to sell his patent to\nSeth Thomas Clock and Waterbury Clock companies in Connecticut. When that did\nnot work out, he decided to form his own company in Ithaca, New York. He\nrecruited Charles D. Johnson, Harvey Platts and John H. Selkreg to invest with\nhim in the founding of the Ithaca Calendar Clock Company.\n\nAt first, the clock had an iron case which was made at a foundry called J.S.\nReynold's Factory and some were made oversees in England. Later on, the case\nwas changed to either rosewood or walnut-type wooden housings and made on site\nat the factory.\n\nThe business was growing by leaps and bounds, expanding it into a very large\ncomplex that included a woodworking room in a separate area to avoid fire,\nhowever, fire came very early in the morning of Feb. 12, 1876. Fortunately,\ndue to insurance and the success of the business, the building could be\nrebuilt. That building still stands today in Ithaca.\n\nThe patented clock could be found at the Centennial Exhibition held in\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, later that year in July, according to a July 18th\narticle in the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper based in Rochester, New York.\nThe journalist pointed out the differences between the many calendar clock\ndisplays and Horton's clock.\n\n\"The several improvements in this clock over those of other manufacture that\nare here presented are known as the patents of Henry B. Horton of Ithaca and\nconsist of the dead-beat escapement first adapted by this company to common\nclocks, thus giving much more accurate time; also the link suspension in place\nof the limber strap that is used in all other common clocks, which causes less\nfriction and is liable to get out of order. The additional day every four\nyears is produced by a wheel which revolves once every eight years.\"\n\nBusiness slowed when the costs to make the clock started to rise and\nbusinesses began to give out free paper calendars to the public as a form of\nadvertising. Business was also affected when brewers and distillers began to\nbe legislated out of business through the Volstead Act, according to the\narticle.\n\nIn 1882, the company made 14 special clocks for the state capital in Albany,\nNew York. From 1981 to the early 1990s, a new company was formed where about\n500 reproductions were made. That company closed due to the higher than\nexpected costs. Today, the Ithaca Calendar Clock Company repairs and\nrefurbishes the clocks for resale and supplies parts.\n\nHenry B. Horton was born in Winchester, Connecticut, and grew up in Covert,\nNew York. When he was 19 years old, he worked as a cabinetmaker under George\nWhiton (b. 1801, d. 1878) for three years. He had a passion for making musical\ninstruments and he produced many. He became widely known for his autophone,\nwhich he first patented in 1877. It was the first mass produced table model\norganette in the United States in 1878 with thousands made. He produced it in\na corner of his clock shop, according to the history written.\n\nAn American Musical Instruments in the Metropolitan Museum of Art publication\nstates, \"Horton's compact free-reed instruments, extensively furnished with\ncurrent tunes in the form of punched paper strips or pinned wooden cylinders,\nwere nearly foolproof, did not need tuning and could be easily mailed; thus\nappealed greatly to rural families.\"\n\nThese instruments commonly found in homes were replaced by radios and\nphonographs.\n\nHorton died suddenly at the age of 66 from neuralgia of the heart - a\ncondition he did not realize that he had.\n\nHis obituary notes, \"Mr. Horton was a kind and genial man widely known and\nuniversally respected. His sudden and unexpected death falls with crushing\nforce upon his bereaved family, while a very large circle of friends will\nsincerely mourn his decease.\"\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Ann E. Downing Horton (b. 1824, d. 1887), and his\nthree daughters, Mrs. J.W. Jagger and Cora and Ida Horton.\n\nMembers of the museum can tour all the exhibits free of charge, while non-\nmembers pay a $5 fee. Senior adults and students pay a $3 entrance fee.\n\nYearly membership to the museum is $15 for seniors, $25 for adults, $10 for\nstudents and $45 for family.\n\nPlease keep informed with our postings by visiting our Facebook site at McMinn\nCounty Living Heritage Museum or visit our website at www.liv\n[ingheritagemuseum.com](http://ingheritagemuseum.com)",

    "html": "<p>Paper calendars and the Volstead Act contributed to the closing of the <org>Ithaca Calendar Clock Company</org> in 1918, according to a history written on the company's website found at www.ithacacalendar</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://clockcompany.com\">clockcompany.com</a></p>\n\n<p>The company was founded by <person>Henry B. Horton</person> (b. 1819, d. 1885) and produced the popular Ithaca Calendar Clock, unique for its accuracy and its ability to work through a <chron>leap year</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>One such clock hangs in the parlor at the <org>McMinn County Living Heritage Museum</org>. It has two circular faces set in a decorative wooden case. The face on the top gives the time and the bottom one gives the day of the week, the date and the month of the year.</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded by Horton in 1865 after he tried to sell his patent to <person>Seth Thomas Clock</person> and Waterbury Clock companies in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ct\">Connecticut</location>. When that did not work out, he decided to form his own company in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.ithaca\">Ithaca, New York</location>. He recruited <person>Charles D. Johnson</person>, <person>Harvey Platts</person> and John H. Selkreg to invest with him in the founding of the <org>Ithaca Calendar Clock Company</org>.</p>\n\n<p>At first, the clock had an iron case which was made at a foundry called J.S. <org>Reynold's Factory</org> and some were made oversees in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.eng\">England</location>. Later on, the case was changed to either rosewood or walnut-type wooden housings and made on site at the factory.</p>\n\n<p>The business was growing by leaps and bounds, expanding it into a very large complex that included a woodworking room in a separate area to avoid fire, however, fire came very early in the morning of <chron>Feb. 12, 1876</chron>. Fortunately, due to insurance and the success of the business, the building could be rebuilt. That building still stands today in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.ithaca\">Ithaca</location>.</p>\n\n<p>The patented clock could be found at the Centennial Exhibition held in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</location>, later that year in July, according to a <chron>July 18th</chron> article in the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper based in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.rchstr\">Rochester, New York</location>. The journalist pointed out the differences between the many calendar clock displays and Horton's clock.</p>\n\n<p>\"The several improvements in this clock over those of other manufacture that are here presented are known as the patents of <person>Henry B. Horton</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.ithaca\">Ithaca</location> and consist of the dead-beat escapement first adapted by this company to common clocks, thus giving much more accurate time; also the link suspension in place of the limber strap that is used in all other common clocks, which causes less friction and is liable to get out of order. The additional day every four years is produced by a wheel which revolves once every eight years.\"</p>\n\n<p>Business slowed when the costs to make the clock started to rise and businesses began to give out free paper calendars to the public as a form of advertising. Business was also affected when brewers and distillers began to be legislated out of business through the Volstead Act, according to the article.</p>\n\n<p>In 1882, the company made 14 special clocks for the state capital in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany, New York</location>. From 1981 to the early 1990s, a new company was formed where about 500 reproductions were made. That company closed due to the higher than expected costs. Today, the <org>Ithaca Calendar Clock Company</org> repairs and refurbishes the clocks for resale and supplies parts.</p>\n\n<p><person>Henry B. Horton</person> was born in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ct.winter\">Winchester, Connecticut</location>, and grew up in Covert, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ny\">New York</location>. When he was 19 years old, he worked as a cabinetmaker under <person>George Whiton</person> (b. 1801, d. 1878) for three years. He had a passion for making musical instruments and he produced many. He became widely known for his autophone, which he first patented in 1877. It was the first mass produced table model organette in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> in 1878 with thousands made. He produced it in a corner of his clock shop, according to the history written.</p>\n\n<p>An American Musical Instruments in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0092686470\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</org> publication states, \"Horton's compact free-reed instruments, extensively furnished with current tunes in the form of punched paper strips or pinned wooden cylinders, were nearly foolproof, did not need tuning and could be easily mailed; thus appealed greatly to rural families.\"</p>\n\n<p>These instruments commonly found in homes were replaced by radios and phonographs.</p>\n\n<p>Horton died suddenly at the age of 66 from neuralgia of the heart - a condition he did not realize that he had.</p>\n\n<p>His obituary notes, \"<person>Mr. Horton</person> was a kind and genial man widely known and universally respected. His sudden and unexpected death falls with crushing force upon his bereaved family, while a very large circle of friends will sincerely mourn his decease.\"</p>\n\n<p>He was survived by his wife, <person>Ann E. Downing Horton</person> (b. 1824, d. 1887), and his three daughters, Mrs. <person>J.W. Jagger</person> and Cora and <person>Ida Horton</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the museum can tour all the exhibits free of charge, while non-members pay a <money>$5</money> fee. Senior adults and students pay a <money>$3</money> entrance fee.</p>\n\n<p>Yearly membership to the museum is <money>$15</money> for seniors, <money>$25</money> for adults, <money>$10</money> for students and <money>$45</money> for family.</p>\n\n<p>Please keep informed with our postings by visiting our Facebook site at <org>McMinn County Living Heritage Museum</org> or visit our website at www.liv <a href=\"http://ingheritagemuseum.com\">ingheritagemuseum.com</a></p>",
