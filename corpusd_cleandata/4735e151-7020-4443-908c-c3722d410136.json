    "text": "This moment-in-time article describes the challenges multiple precision\nmachine shops faced - and met - to support customers' and employees' needs\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt some point, every precision machine shop is approached by a customer with a\n\"hot job,\" one that needs to be turned ASAP. In March, many shops began making\naccommodations for what might have been the most important hot jobs they'll\never take on: machining much-needed components for ventilators and other\nmedical devices to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs impressive as their fast response was, so too was the coming together as a\nmachining community to immediately react to the needs of their customers, and\nhow they were similarly sensitive to the needs of their employees in the\nprocess.\n\nIn late March, I contacted Rich Hoster, president of Smith and Richardson in\nGeneva, Illinois. The contract shop was asked to increase production of six\ncomponents it machines for ventilator valves. Mr. Hoster says that prior to\nreceiving these customer requests, the company noted the effect the virus was\nhaving on the economy and its operation. It began limiting work hours for most\nemployees it refers to as \"team members\" to 40 hours per week, amid concerns\nthat customers would start curtailing orders. The company also started\nproviding daily updates to all employees about changing conditions. Because it\nalso has an operation in China, it had a first-hand look at this situation\nand, thus, had been dealing with the virus' effect on that business as far\nback as late January.\n\nOnce Smith and Richardson received the emergency orders for ventilator valve\ncomponents, it began to contact its customers to reschedule their orders so\nthat the six components could run across six different machines. \"All were\nvery understanding,\" Mr. Hoster says.\n\nThe company put its team on overtime and continued to communicate the need for\neveryone to remain healthy so that part production could continue\nuninterrupted. Those who were not feeling well were required to stay home and\nuse their sick days. (The company also offers PTO.) To help team members with\nchildren whose schools were closing, the company paid for child care for those\nwho did not currently have it, so they could keep working and not need to\nworry about it.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Hoster reached out to numerous Illinois elected officials,\nsuch as Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Representative Lauren\nUnderwood, Governor J.B. Pritzker and State Senator Don Dewitte, as well as\nhis local mayor and police department to make sure that all were in support of\nthe company producing these parts if a statewide shutdown was ordered. \"All\nwere very accommodating and worked to make sure that we would be able to\ncontinue to manufacture these parts,\" Mr. Hoster says.\n\nHe notes that those at the Franklin Partnership, as well as Mark Denzler at\nthe Illinois Manufacturers' Association, worked hard to educate all elected\nofficials on the necessity of these parts. In addition, he says those at the\nPrecision Machined Products Association (PMPA) were a great conduit of\ninformation and provided it daily. Smith and Richardson created a\nquestionnaire for any critical visitors to the plant that determined their\nability to access the facility and has now started taking all team members'\ntemperatures daily.\n\nIn fact, the PMPA shared part prints for 39 muchneeded ventilator parts with\nits members, asking if they have the capability, time and resources to produce\nany or all of these parts. Many took on these jobs. The PMPA also made a list\nof all the member shops capable of mobilizing to make ventilator parts and\nsubmitted it to GM, FEMA and other known ventilator producers so that the\ncompanies that need the parts to build the ventilators know where to get them.\n\n\"Our industry came together to share our capability and capacity to produce\nthese critically needed ventilator parts,\" says Cate Smith, PMPA's executive\ndirector.\n\nFurther extending its contributions to battling the coronavirus crisis, PMPA\nhas assembled and continually updates a thorough compilation of COVID-19\nresources to help shops stay on top of the latest related safety guidelines,\nregulations and employee support ideas. The site is broken down by state to\nhelp navigate to the documents most pertinent to a shop's needs.\n\nCulture, Communication, Technology\n\nDuring a webinar in April hosted by MachineMetrics (a provider of machine\nmonitoring and analytics solutions), principals from three other shops\nsimilarly described their experiences. What they shared showed that successful\nnavigation of this unprecedented situation came down to shop culture,\ncommunication and technology.\n\nAneesa Muthana, president and co-owner of Pioneer Service, who I spoke with\nthe day prior to the webinar, says her shop has lost business in some areas\nand gained in others. Two of her Addison, Illinois, shop's customers in the\nelectric vehicle industry put a hold on their orders. However, seven customers\nsent the shop \"essential business\" letters minutes after the \"stay-at-home\"\norder from Governor Pritzker. \"We knew we made parts for ventilators and other\nmedical devices, but that has expanded drastically in the past few weeks,\" she\nexplains. \"A customer that makes valves for stretchers is ramping up, and\nwe've submitted our bid on a new project at a volume of 400,000 pieces for two\npart numbers. This is in addition to the parts we're already making for them.\"\nIn addition, a customer that manufactures products for biomedical testing\nreached out to her personally asking for its support, and the shop shipped\nthree months' worth of releases in one week alone.\n\nPioneer Service has purchased $7 million in equipment over the last six years.\n\"There is so much standardization these days in terms of high technology,\nprocesses, training and tooling that the switch to different work isn't as bad\nas it would have been years ago,\" Ms. Muthana says.\n\nThe shop's precision machine tools can be used to make virtually any part that\nfits in them. So, any change to a new type of part wasn't really a pivot, but\nmore of a ramping up to higher production volumes. The challenge came with\nstaffing levels as the shop dealt with employees' specific needs.\n\nWith schools facing shutdowns, Ms. Muthana personally reached out to every\nemployee with children to find out if they needed to adjust their work\nschedule. She even set up the shop's cafeteria with laptops and coloring\nbooks, in case parents chose to bring their children to the shop. Some did\nthat until they found child care services.\n\nMichael Tamasi, president and CEO of AccuRounds in Avon, Massachusetts, says\nhis shop was impacted in a different way. At the onset of the pandemic, it was\nin the pipeline to machine ventilator parts, but wasn't yet making them.\nInstead, the shop saw an increase in business from customers making\ncentrifuges and related devices for vaccine production.\n\nThis required quick acceleration of existing processes, despite having 10% of\nthe shop's at-risk employees away. Mr. Tamasi says this meant the shop had to\ntake a careful look at its production schedule and match that work with those\nemployees the shop had on site. Effective communication between sales,\nengineering and production departments was also vital to ensure all jobs are\nprocessed properly.\n\nAccuRounds typically runs two shifts each day, covering 18 hours. However,\n\"We've opened shop to run 24/7 so we can accommodate any team members who\nwould want to work more hours or come in on the weekends,\" Mr. Tamasi says.\n\"Some might also choose to come in when there are fewer people in the shop\njust for increased safety and distancing.\" The shop also split lunch breaks\ninto three separate smaller groups to minimize close employee interaction. \"We\nmust be very flexible with all this.\"\n\nIt has also worked to enhance communication, not only with regard to what's\nhappening inside the shop but outside as well. Mr. Tamasi, who co-chairs the\nMassachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team, believes it is important\nto keep employees abreast of outside forces that can impact the shop in one\nway or another.\n\nBill Berrien, CEO and owner of Milwaukee's Pindel Global Precision, says his\ncompany's introduction to ventilators came on the afternoon of March 20 when\nit received purchase orders for five ventilator parts. The shop was able to\nramp up with those new jobs and begin shipping at the customer's requested\nvolume levels in one week. \"The solution is all about speed,\" he explains.\n\"It's looking at your entire manufacturing process, from receiving orders to\nmaking parts to delivering the parts, and attacking it as aggressively as a\nmachining operation.\"\n\nMr. Berrien, a former Navy SEAL platoon commander, likens advanced\nmanufacturing to the military because both require highly trained, cohesive\nteams. \"It's not about central command or control when reacting to a crisis\nsituation,\" he says. \"Instead, you must ensure your employees understand the\nobjectives and goals, and then let them individually problem solve to get\nthere.\"\n\nIt is also important to understand there is only so much one can control, Mr.\nBerrien notes. \"The leadership mantra I share is 'be where you are.' Do what\nyou can and make peace with the rest. Appreciate this situation for the\ndifferent reality that it is, knowing it's going to be fleeting. Make peace\nwith it, but also appreciate the different perspective it might offer.\" pm\n\n\"Those at the PMPA were a great conduit of information and provided it to our\nteam daily.\"\n\nRich Hosier\n\nOur Company President Responds\n\nProduction Machining is one of many brands published by Gardner Business Media\n(GBM). Fourth-generation co-owner and GBM President, Rick Kline Jr., recently\nhas taken to a number of channels to explain how the manufacturing community\nis coming together to assist in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. For\nexample, in an op-ed featured by the Wall Street Journal in March, he explains\nhow U.S. manufacturers are rallying to increase production of vital equipment\nto aid in efforts to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The piece suggests\nthat manufacturers are creatively rising to the challenge of meeting emergency\nproduction needs. It also criticizes government intervention on the matter.\nMr. Kline draws on examples from GBM brands (such as Additive Manufacturing,\nAutoBeat, Plastics Technology and MoldMaking Technology) to tell stories\nillustrating his point.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is nimble and strong, says Mr. Kline. An event such as\nthe coronavirus is putting the industry to the test, but the solidarity and\ningenuity of our nation's makers is still shining through.\n\nHis op-ed argues that the next step will have to be consolidating the lessons\nfrom the pandemic in order to ensure that U.S. manufacturing is prepared to\nrespond to the next crisis that comes. The appearance of the op-ed marks the\nWall Street Journal's recognition that the coronavirus crisis brings attention\nto, among other things, U.S. manufacturing. Find the full article at\ngbm.media/mfg.\n\nIn addition, he has created a series of videos discussing the current state of\nmanufacturing during the COVID-19 crisis. (View these at\n[short.gardnerweb.com/covid](http://short.gardnerweb.com/covid). In one, he\noffers an open call to hear the stories of manufacturers and machine shops\nsuch as yours that are responding to the need for devices to assist in the\nfight against the coronavirus.\n\nVisit covidstory.pagedemo.co to tell your tale.\n\nMachineMetrics | 413-531-7490 |\n[machinemetrics.com](http://machinemetrics.com)\n\nPrecision Machined Products Association | 440-526-0300 |\n[pmpa.org](http://pmpa.org)",

In March, many shops began making accommodations for what might have been the most important hot jobs they'll ever take on: machining much-needed components for ventilators and other medical devices to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>As impressive as their fast response was, so too was the coming together as a machining community to immediately react to the needs of their customers, and how they were similarly sensitive to the needs of their employees in the process.</p>\n<p>In late March, I contacted <person>Rich Hoster</person>, president of Smith and Richardson in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.geneva\">Geneva, Illinois</location>. The contract shop was asked to increase production of six components it machines for ventilator valves. <person>Mr. Hoster</person> says that prior to receiving these customer requests, the company noted the effect the virus was having on the economy and its operation. It began limiting work hours for most employees it refers to as \"team members\" to 40 hours per week, amid concerns that customers would start curtailing orders. The company also started providing daily updates to all employees about changing conditions. Because it also has an operation in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, it had a first-hand look at this situation and, thus, had been dealing with the virus' effect on that business as far back as late January.</p>\n<p>Once Smith and Richardson received the emergency orders for ventilator valve components, it began to contact its customers to reschedule their orders so that the six components could run across six different machines. \"All were very understanding,\" <person>Mr. Hoster</person> says.</p>\n<p>The company put its team on overtime and continued to communicate the need for everyone to remain healthy so that part production could continue uninterrupted. Those who were not feeling well were required to stay home and use their sick days. (The company also offers PTO.) To help team members with children whose schools were closing, the company paid for child care for those who did not currently have it, so they could keep working and not need to worry about it.</p>\n<p>In addition, <person>Mr. Hoster</person> reached out to numerous <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.il\">Illinois</location> elected officials, such as Senator <person>Dick Durbin</person>, Senator <person>Tammy Duckworth</person>, Representative <person>Lauren Underwood</person>, Governor <person>J.B. Pritzker</person> and State Senator <person>Don Dewitte</person>, as well as his local mayor and police department to make sure that all were in support of the company producing these parts if a statewide shutdown was ordered. \"All were very accommodating and worked to make sure that we would be able to continue to manufacture these parts,\" <person>Mr. Hoster</person> says.</p>\n<p>He notes that those at the <org>Franklin Partnership</org>, as well as <person>Mark Denzler</person> at the <org>Illinois Manufacturers' Association</org>, worked hard to educate all elected officials on the necessity of these parts. In addition, he says those at the <org>Precision Machined Products Association</org> (PMPA) were a great conduit of information and provided it daily. Smith and Richardson created a questionnaire for any critical visitors to the plant that determined their ability to access the facility and has now started taking all team members' temperatures daily.</p>\n<p>In fact, the PMPA shared part prints for 39 muchneeded ventilator parts with its members, asking if they have the capability, time and resources to produce any or all of these parts. Many took on these jobs. The PMPA also made a list of all the member shops capable of mobilizing to make ventilator parts and submitted it to <org>GM</org>, <org>FEMA</org> and other known ventilator producers so that the companies that need the parts to build the ventilators know where to get them.</p>\n<p>\"Our industry came together to share our capability and capacity to produce these critically needed ventilator parts,\" says <person>Cate Smith</person>, PMPA's executive director.</p>\n<p>Further extending its contributions to battling the coronavirus crisis, PMPA has assembled and continually updates a thorough compilation of COVID-19 resources to help shops stay on top of the latest related safety guidelines, regulations and employee support ideas. The site is broken down by state to help navigate to the documents most pertinent to a shop's needs.</p>\n<p>Culture, Communication, Technology</p>\n<p>During a webinar in April hosted by MachineMetrics (a provider of machine monitoring and analytics solutions), principals from three other shops similarly described their experiences. What they shared showed that successful navigation of this unprecedented situation came down to shop culture, communication and technology.</p>\n<p><person>Aneesa Muthana</person>, president and co-owner of Pioneer Service, who I spoke with the day prior to the webinar, says her shop has lost business in some areas and gained in others. Two of her <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.addson\">Addison, Illinois</location>, shop's customers in the electric vehicle industry put a hold on their orders. However, seven customers sent the shop \"essential business\" letters minutes after the \"stay-at-home\" order from <person>Governor Pritzker</person>. \"We knew we made parts for ventilators and other medical devices, but that has expanded drastically in the past few weeks,\" she explains. \"A customer that makes valves for stretchers is ramping up, and we've submitted our bid on a new project at a volume of 400,000 pieces for two part numbers. This is in addition to the parts we're already making for them.\" In addition, a customer that manufactures products for biomedical testing reached out to her personally asking for its support, and the shop shipped three months' worth of releases in one week alone.</p>\n<p>Pioneer Service has purchased <money>$7 million</money> in equipment over the last six years. \"There is so much standardization these days in terms of high technology, processes, training and tooling that the switch to different work isn't as bad as it would have been years ago,\" <person>Ms. Muthana</person> says.</p>\n<p>The shop's precision machine tools can be used to make virtually any part that fits in them. So, any change to a new type of part wasn't really a pivot, but more of a ramping up to higher production volumes. The challenge came with staffing levels as the shop dealt with employees' specific needs.</p>\n<p>With schools facing shutdowns, <person>Ms. Muthana</person> personally reached out to every employee with children to find out if they needed to adjust their work schedule. She even set up the shop's cafeteria with laptops and coloring books, in case parents chose to bring their children to the shop. Some did that until they found child care services.</p>\n<p><person>Michael Tamasi</person>, president and CEO of AccuRounds in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.avon\">Avon, Massachusetts</location>, says his shop was impacted in a different way. At the onset of the pandemic, it was in the pipeline to machine ventilator parts, but wasn't yet making them. Instead, the shop saw an increase in business from customers making centrifuges and related devices for vaccine production.</p>\n<p>This required quick acceleration of existing processes, despite having 10% of the shop's at-risk employees away. <person>Mr. Tamasi</person> says this meant the shop had to take a careful look at its production schedule and match that work with those employees the shop had on site. Effective communication between sales, engineering and production departments was also vital to ensure all jobs are processed properly.</p>\n<p>AccuRounds typically runs two shifts each day, covering 18 hours. However, \"We've opened shop to run 24/7 so we can accommodate any team members who would want to work more hours or come in on the weekends,\" <person>Mr. Tamasi</person> says. \"Some might also choose to come in when there are fewer people in the shop just for increased safety and distancing.\" The shop also split lunch breaks into three separate smaller groups to minimize close employee interaction. \"We must be very flexible with all this.\"</p>\n<p>It has also worked to enhance communication, not only with regard to what's happening inside the shop but outside as well. <person>Mr. Tamasi</person>, who co-chairs the <org>Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team</org>, believes it is important to keep employees abreast of outside forces that can impact the shop in one way or another.</p>\n<p><person>Bill Berrien</person>, CEO and owner of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee's</location> Pindel Global Precision, says his company's introduction to ventilators came on the afternoon of <chron>March 20</chron> when it received purchase orders for five ventilator parts. The shop was able to ramp up with those new jobs and begin shipping at the customer's requested volume levels in one week. \"The solution is all about speed,\" he explains. \"It's looking at your entire manufacturing process, from receiving orders to making parts to delivering the parts, and attacking it as aggressively as a machining operation.\"</p>\n<p><person>Mr. Berrien</person>, a former Navy SEAL platoon commander, likens advanced manufacturing to the military because both require highly trained, cohesive teams. \"It's not about central command or control when reacting to a crisis situation,\" he says. \"Instead, you must ensure your employees understand the objectives and goals, and then let them individually problem solve to get there.\"</p>\n<p>It is also important to understand there is only so much one can control, <person>Mr. Berrien</person> notes. \"The leadership mantra I share is 'be where you are.' Do what you can and make peace with the rest. Appreciate this situation for the different reality that it is, knowing it's going to be fleeting. Make peace with it, but also appreciate the different perspective it might offer.\" pm</p>\n\n<object class=\"mstar_text_entity\"><param name=\"mstar_entity_type\" value=\"Sidebar\" /><param name=\"mstar_entity_inline\" value=\"Y\" /><div class=\"Sidebar_content\">\n<p>\"Those at the PMPA were a great conduit of information and provided it to our team daily.\"</p>\n<p><person>Rich Hosier</person></p>\n<p>Our Company President Responds</p>\n<p>Production Machining is one of many brands published by Gardner Business Media (GBM). Fourth-generation co-owner and GBM President, <person>Rick Kline Jr</person>., recently has taken to a number of channels to explain how the manufacturing community is coming together to assist in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in an op-ed featured by the <org>Wall Street Journal</org> in March, he explains how <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> manufacturers are rallying to increase production of vital equipment to aid in efforts to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The piece suggests that manufacturers are creatively rising to the challenge of meeting emergency production needs. It also criticizes government intervention on the matter. <person>Mr. Kline</person> draws on examples from GBM brands (such as Additive Manufacturing, AutoBeat, Plastics Technology and MoldMaking Technology) to tell stories illustrating his point.</p>\n<p>American manufacturing is nimble and strong, says <person>Mr. Kline</person>. An event such as the coronavirus is putting the industry to the test, but the solidarity and ingenuity of our nation's makers is still shining through.</p>\n<p>His op-ed argues that the next step will have to be consolidating the lessons from the pandemic in order to ensure that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> manufacturing is prepared to respond to the next crisis that comes. The appearance of the op-ed marks the <org>Wall Street Journal's</org> recognition that the coronavirus crisis brings attention to, among other things, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> manufacturing. Find the full article at gbm.media/mfg.</p>\n<p>In addition, he has created a series of videos discussing the current state of manufacturing during the COVID-19 crisis. (View these at <a href=\"http://short.gardnerweb.com/covid\">short.gardnerweb.com/covid</a>. In one, he offers an open call to hear the stories of manufacturers and machine shops such as yours that are responding to the need for devices to assist in the fight against the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Visit covidstory.pagedemo.co to tell your tale.</p>\n<p>MachineMetrics | 413-531-7490 | <a href=\"http://machinemetrics.com\">machinemetrics.com</a></p>\n<p><org>Precision Machined Products Association</org> | 440-526-0300 | <a href=\"http://pmpa.org\">pmpa.org</a></p>\n</div></object>",
