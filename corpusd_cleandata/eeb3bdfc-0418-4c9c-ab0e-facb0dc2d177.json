    "text": "Hundreds of protesters gathered on Bridge Street on June 6, as part of a wave\nof demonstrations after the death of George Floyd.\n\nFloyd was a 46-year-old Minneapolis man whose death during an arrest for\nallegedly using counterfeit money sparked protests against police brutality\nand racial injustice throughout the country.\n\nThe Charlevoix event was organized on Facebook by long-time resident Sarah\nPolena-Antinossi in less than a week's time with help from Boyne City resident\nJessica Oppermann.\n\n\"When George Floyd called out for his mama because he knew he was dying, that\nwas it for me. That was when I realized that I can't sit behind my phone\nscreen anymore. I need to do something. I need to be an ally. I need to be a\nvoice. I need to use the privilege of my skin color to stand up for and stand\nnext to people and help them,\" said Polena-Antinossi, a 1997 Charlevoix High\nSchool graduate.\n\nOn the day of the demonstration, Polena-Antinossi was one of several\nparticipants that carried a sign reading, \"All mothers were summoned when he\ncalled out for his mama. #GeorgeFloyd.\"\n\nPolena-Antinossi reached out to Charlevoix police chief Gerard Doan prior to\nthe event to ensure coordination with the police department.\n\nAt her request, Doan and a few other officers attended the event, sitting\nacross the street in police vehicles or standing on the sidewalk.\n\n\"We kept the line of communication open,\" said Doan. \"She came over and talked\nto me a couple of times during the event and I went over and talked to her a\ncouple of times.\"\n\nDoan said aside from a few people driving by yelling obscenities at the\nprotesters there was no trouble that resulted from the demonstration and all\nparticipants were respectfully not blocking the sidewalks or streets.\n\n\"She did a lot of homework on her own ahead of time. She did a lot of\nresearch. She went on the city website and looked at the ordinances - you\ncan't block city sidewalks, or use loud speaker devices ... a great deal of\nthe homework was already done ahead of time so that her and I just kind of\nbrainstormed a few things and she had everything ready to go. It was a very\nsmooth operation,\" Doan said.\n\nDoan said Saturday's demonstration was the largest he has seen in Charlevoix\nin the 34 years he has been with the force. Doan has been Charlevoix's police\nchief since 2006.\n\nTwo separate rallies were held on June 6; the first from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and\nthe second from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. At the halfway point during each rally, the\norganizers asked the crowd to kneel for eight minutes and 46 seconds - the\namount of time that officer Derrick Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's\nneck.\n\nDuring the second rally, the kneeling protesters stretched from Antrim Street\nto Clinton Street in front of East Park.\n\nCoinciding with Charlevoix's demonstration, a number of protests occurred\nacross the country on Saturday, including Washington, D.C.'s largest protest\nso far in which tens of thousands of people participated and security forces\nblocked any approach to the White House, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhen asked if he or his team has felt any backlash during this time, Chief\nDoan said just the opposite - that the Charlevoix police department has felt\nappreciation from the community.\n\n\"We had a lot of folks come up to us during the event and thank us for doing\nour job. They said they appreciate the job that our officers do in our town\nand in the area. Lots of people approached us and thanked us for what we did,\nwhich was very humbling,\" Doan said.",

    "html": "<p>Hundreds of protesters gathered on <location>Bridge Street</location> on <chron>June 6</chron>, as part of a wave of demonstrations after the death of <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n<p>Floyd was a 46-year-old <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> man whose death during an arrest for allegedly using counterfeit money sparked protests against police brutality and racial injustice throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>The Charlevoix event was organized on Facebook by long-time resident <person>Sarah Polena-Antinossi</person> in less than a week's time with help from Boyne City resident <person>Jessica Oppermann</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"When <person>George Floyd</person> called out for his mama because he knew he was dying, that was it for me. That was when I realized that I can't sit behind my phone screen anymore. I need to do something. I need to be an ally. I need to be a voice. I need to use the privilege of my skin color to stand up for and stand next to people and help them,\" said Polena-Antinossi, a 1997 <org>Charlevoix High School</org> graduate.</p>\n\n<p>On the day of the demonstration, Polena-Antinossi was one of several participants that carried a sign reading, \"All mothers were summoned when he called out for his mama. #GeorgeFloyd.\"</p>\n\n<p>Polena-Antinossi reached out to Charlevoix police chief <person>Gerard Doan</person> prior to the event to ensure coordination with the police department.</p>\n\n<p>At her request, Doan and a few other officers attended the event, sitting across the street in police vehicles or standing on the sidewalk.</p>\n\n<p>\"We kept the line of communication open,\" said Doan. \"She came over and talked to me a couple of times during the event and I went over and talked to her a couple of times.\"</p>\n\n<p>Doan said aside from a few people driving by yelling obscenities at the protesters there was no trouble that resulted from the demonstration and all participants were respectfully not blocking the sidewalks or streets.</p>\n\n<p>\"She did a lot of homework on her own ahead of time. She did a lot of research. She went on the city website and looked at the ordinances - you can't block city sidewalks, or use loud speaker devices ... a great deal of the homework was already done ahead of time so that her and I just kind of brainstormed a few things and she had everything ready to go. It was a very smooth operation,\" Doan said.</p>\n\n<p>Doan said Saturday's demonstration was the largest he has seen in Charlevoix in the 34 years he has been with the force. Doan has been Charlevoix's police chief since 2006.</p>\n\n<p>Two separate rallies were held on <chron>June 6</chron>; the first from <chron>11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</chron> and the second from <chron>4 p.m. to 6 p.m.</chron> At the halfway point during each rally, the organizers asked the crowd to kneel for eight minutes and 46 seconds - the amount of time that officer <person>Derrick Chauvin</person> pressed his knee into Floyd's neck.</p>\n\n<p>During the second rally, the kneeling protesters stretched from <location>Antrim Street</location> to <location>Clinton Street</location> in front of <location>East Park</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Coinciding with Charlevoix's demonstration, a number of protests occurred across the country on Saturday, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, D.C.'s</location> largest protest so far in which tens of thousands of people participated and security forces blocked any approach to the <org>White House</org>, according to the <org>Washington Post</org>.</p>\n\n<p>When asked if he or his team has felt any backlash during this time, <person>Chief Doan</person> said just the opposite - that the Charlevoix police department has felt appreciation from the community.</p>\n\n<p>\"We had a lot of folks come up to us during the event and thank us for doing our job. They said they appreciate the job that our officers do in our town and in the area. Lots of people approached us and thanked us for what we did, which was very humbling,\" Doan said.</p>",
