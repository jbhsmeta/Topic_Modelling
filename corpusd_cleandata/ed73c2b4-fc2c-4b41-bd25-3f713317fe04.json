    "text": "While the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to increase in the\nTwin Counties, the concern over the number of confirmed cases among Hispanics\nincreases at an even greater rate.\n\nOn Friday, Edgecombe County reported 190 cases with nine deaths and 163 people\nrecovered, while Nash County reported 198 total cases with four deaths and 125\npeople recovered.\n\nDuring a Friday morning Nash County team management meeting, Health Director\nBill Hill reported that his agency was seeing an increased number of positives\nas testing has increased.\n\n\"We expected to see that with the increased testing,\" he said, \"but we are\nseeing more and more Hispanics (testing positive) and that is a concern.\"\n\nHill said that of six new cases heading into Friday, four people were\nHispanics. Over the Memorial Day weekend, six members of one Hispanic family,\nincluding a 6-year-old, tested positive.\n\nHill said that in the six latest cases, there was a husband and wife in their\n50s, as well as people in their 30s and 40s.\n\nEdgecombe County provides no demographic information, claiming immunity under\nHIPPA guidelines and citing a belief that by identifying a person testing\npositive by gender or race, it could lead to their being identified.\n\nEdgecombe County health department officials have declined to reply to at\nleast two e-mails regarding what County Manager Eric Evans told county\ncommissioners was an increasing number of cases among Hispanics.\n\nThe next week, when commissioners met in joint session with the Edgecombe\nCounty Public Schools board, Evans backed off that statement and said only\nthat, \"The demographics are changing daily.\"\n\nWhile Edgecombe provides no updates, Nash has visited farm labor camps and met\nwith farmers in an effort to stem the growth of cases among Hispanics as the\nmigrant work force grows.\n\nEven with that, Nash County Manager Zee Lamb said, \"There does seems to be a\nspike in the cases among Hispanics  disproportionately that demographic is\ngrowing beyond their population.\"\n\nStatewide, cases showed a slight decline on Friday in North Carolina, but the\nnumber of positive case reports has spiked with increased testing, according\nto the state Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThere were 1,076 new cases of COVID-19 since Thursday, the DHHS reported. That\ncame after 15,704 completed tests for the virus, a one-day high, as more\ntesting sites open across the state.\n\nThe state reported that there have been 859 deaths from the coronavirus, with\nthe DHHS data showing 84 percent of the fatalities have been people ages 65 or\nolder.",

Over the <chron>Memorial Day</chron> weekend, six members of one Hispanic family, including a 6-year-old, tested positive.</p>\n\n<p>Hill said that in the six latest cases, there was a husband and wife in their 50s, as well as people in their 30s and 40s.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.edgmbe\">Edgecombe County</location> provides no demographic information, claiming immunity under HIPPA guidelines and citing a belief that by identifying a person testing positive by gender or race, it could lead to their being identified.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.edgmbe\">Edgecombe County</location> health department officials have declined to reply to at least two e-mails regarding what County Manager <person>Eric Evans</person> told county commissioners was an increasing number of cases among Hispanics.</p>\n\n<p>The next week, when commissioners met in joint session with the <org>Edgecombe County Public Schools</org> board, Evans backed off that statement and said only that, \"The demographics are changing daily.\"</p>\n\n<p>While <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.edgmbe\">Edgecombe</location> provides no updates, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.nash\">Nash</location> has visited farm labor camps and met with farmers in an effort to stem the growth of cases among Hispanics as the migrant work force grows.</p>\n\n<p>Even with that, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.nash\">Nash County</location> Manager <person>Zee Lamb</person> said, \"There does seems to be a spike in the cases among Hispanics &#133; disproportionately that demographic is growing beyond their population.\"</p>\n\n<p>Statewide, cases showed a slight decline on Friday in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location>, but the number of positive case reports has spiked with increased testing, according to the state <org>Department of Health and Human Services</org>.</p>\n\n<p>There were 1,076 new cases of COVID-19 since Thursday, the DHHS reported. That came after 15,704 completed tests for the virus, a one-day high, as more testing sites open across the state.</p>\n\n<p>The state reported that there have been 859 deaths from the coronavirus, with the DHHS data showing 84 percent of the fatalities have been people ages 65 or older.</p>",
