    "text": "Be Original Americas, the non-profit advocacy group for original design, has\nannounced updated information on the first worldwide virtual student\nfellowship. From June 15 - July 17, 2020, 26 design companies, makers, and\ncreators will present through a series of webinars to a global audience of\nstudents. Each session will focus on a different aspect of the design process\nand provide an inside look into the factories, architecture and design\nstudios, and headquarters of Be Original Americas member companies around the\nworld creating authentic design. The program will offer insights from leading\nbrands, makers, and creators to learn about working in an industry that shapes\nthe way we live, work, and play.\n\nFirstly, Be Original Americas announced the addition of Charlene C. Lam, to\nour team as Content Producer. Charlene's clients include WantedDesign and\nother creative organizations. Charlene will help Be Original Americas produce\na cohesive, engaging online program for these global students, and we are\ntruly lucky to have her.\n\nSecondly, they want to thank Odile Hainaut and Claire Pijoulat of WantedDesign\nand Phil Robinson of the International Contemporary Furniture Fair\n(ICFF)--which is owned by Emerald X, the parent company of Contract magazine--\nfor their support of this program.\n\nCarl Hansen & S\u00f8n is releasing the iconic Wishbone chair in five Special\nEdition matte finishes, aptly referred to as Soft Colors, in partnership with\nBe Original Americas. A portion of proceeds from all sales of the CH24 Soft\nchairs will benefit Be Original Americas' Student Fellowship program.\n\nThis virtual student fellowship was developed in place of Be Original Americas\nAnnual Design Fellowship, in which two students won the opportunity to visit\nstudios and companies, and speak to designers, makers, and creators in person\nin multiple cities. Due to the current situation, this iteration allows for\nmany more students around the world access to these member companies globally.\n\nHundreds of students have already registered. This opportunity is available to\ncurrently enrolled university students. Students around the world are welcome\nto attend. To register and receive updates, please visit their page.\n\nRegister for one or all of the first Be Original Americas virtual fellowship\nsessions here.",

From <chron>June 15</chron> &#8211; <chron>July 17, 2020</chron>, 26 design companies, makers, and creators will present through a series of webinars to a global audience of students. Each session will focus on a different aspect of the design process and provide an inside look into the factories, architecture and design studios, and headquarters of Be Original Americas member companies around the world creating authentic design. The program will offer insights from leading brands, makers, and creators to learn about working in an industry that shapes the way we live, work, and play.</p>\n<p>Firstly, Be Original Americas announced the addition of <person>Charlene C. Lam</person>, to our team as Content Producer. Charlene&#8217;s clients include WantedDesign and other creative organizations. Charlene will help Be Original Americas produce a cohesive, engaging online program for these global students, and we are truly lucky to have her.</p>\n<p>Secondly, they want to thank <person>Odile Hainaut</person> and <person>Claire Pijoulat</person> of WantedDesign and <person>Phil Robinson</person> of the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF)&#8212;which is owned by Emerald X, the parent company of Contract magazine&#8212;for their support of this program.</p>\n<p><person>Carl Hansen</person> &amp; S&#248;n is releasing the iconic Wishbone chair in five Special Edition matte finishes, aptly referred to as Soft Colors, in partnership with Be Original Americas. A portion of proceeds from all sales of the CH24 Soft chairs will benefit Be Original Americas&#8217; Student Fellowship program.</p>\n<p>This virtual student fellowship was developed in place of Be Original Americas Annual Design Fellowship, in which two students won the opportunity to visit studios and companies, and speak to designers, makers, and creators in person in multiple cities. Due to the current situation, this iteration allows for many more students around the world access to these member companies globally.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of students have already registered. This opportunity is available to currently enrolled university students. Students around the world are welcome to attend. To register and receive updates, please visit their page.</p>\n<p>Register for one or all of the first Be Original Americas virtual fellowship sessions here.</p>",
