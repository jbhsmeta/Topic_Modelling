    "text": "Approximately 400 people gathered in front of Santa Maria City Hall for a\npeaceful protest Sunday afternoon before marching in the traffic lanes in\nresponse to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died at the knee of a\nwhite Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day.\n\nLater, after many demonstrators left, others gathered to sit in the middle of\nthe intersection at Broadway and Cook Street as drivers revved their engines\nand screeched tires in support.\n\nAs of 9 p.m., a small group remained at the scene and removed at least one\nAmerican flag displayed on the corner. Authorities also responded to a\nstabbing victim in the area as the once peaceful event took on a different\npersonality.\n\nThe actions in the name of Black Lives Matter attracted people of all races\nwho called for reforms with chants of \"Say his name!\" answered by \"George\nFloyd!\"\n\nFloyd, 46, died May 25 while in police custody. A bystander's viral cellphone\nvideo showed Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on the handcuffed man's neck for\nnearly nine minutes while he repeatedly exclaimed, \"I can't breathe.\" Floyd\nwas nonresponsive for the last three minutes of the video.\n\nChauvin, 44, and three other officers were fired the next day, and Chauvin was\narrested and charged May 29 with third-degree murder and second-degree\nmanslaughter.\n\nThe incident prompted revulsion across the nation, along with peaceful\nprotests against racism and police brutality - and widespread rioting.\n\nIn addition to the Santa Maria protest, peaceful demonstrations were held\nSunday in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo and in Lompoc on Saturday.\n\nMore than once, Santa Maria organizers called for participants to kneel on one\nknee - symbolic of the action that led to Floyd's death as well as the\ncontroversial protest waged by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin\nKaepernick to highlight police brutality.\n\nAmid the ongoing coronavirus public health emergency, most in attendance wore\nvarious types of masks. A bottle of hand sanitizer was taped to an anti-\ntobacco sign in front of City Hall.\n\nSpeakers also urged demonstrators to maintain social distancing but most\npeople stood closer than 6 feet.\n\nAt one point, an organizer used the microphone to issue a warning about\ninstigators in the crowd and calling for protesters to avoid reacting.\n\nFor some participants, including members of Showing Up for Racial Justice,\nSunday's protest marked the second action in a week. Several protesters\nattended last weekend's demonstration at the Lompoc Federal Correctional\nComplex to highlight inmate conditions there.\n\nAs protesters stood in front of City Hall, passing drivers honked horns or\nheld cellphones to record the protest. One motorcyclist drove by several\ntimes, sometimes performing a wheelie while doing so.\n\nNearly two hours into the protest, the crowd began marching south on Broadway\nto Stowell Road a mile away before turning north. People chanted and waved\nsigns while walking in traffic lanes along the route as vehicles traveled\nbehind them.\n\nOther than occasional patrol officers driving by, Santa Maria police remained\naway from the scene.\n\nOn Sunday, the department posted on its Twitter feed that the agency \"wants to\nthank our community for the peaceful protest.\"\n\n\"We know our community and know we will get through this together,\" the post\nsaid. \"Thank you for your cooperation and support.\"\n\nEven as protesters took up spots in the intersection Sunday evening, police\nstayed more than a block away.\n\nThe group eventually moved toward Macy's at the Santa Maria Town Center before\nreturning to the intersection of Broadway and Cook Street.\n\nAs protesters took up position near Macy's to shoot off fireworks and spin\nout, a black man on a bicycle noted the action more than a block away.\n\n\"This is uncalled for,\" he said. \"It is not honoring him (Floyd) at all.\"\n\nInstead of the peaceful protest earlier, the Sunday night crowd appeared to\ninclude newcomers who had not participated in the earlier events.\n\nLate Sunday, some members in the crowd targeted an American flag flying on the\ncorner and a small fire burned in the roadway.\n\nVeterans vowed on social media to replace the flag as others worked to\nidentify the people responsible for the vandalism.\n\nIn addition to vandalism, those involved Sunday night also brought violence.\n\nSanta Maria police confirmed that a male stabbing victim was transported by\nCalstar medical helicopter to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Additional\ninformation, including extent of injuries, was not immediately available.\n\nPolice also said some of the demonstrators had entered the mall as of late\nSunday night.\n\nDue to riots in other communities and local protests, Target and other\nbusinesses reportedly closed early in Santa Maria on Sunday.\n\n\\- Noozhawk North County editor Janene Scully can be reached at .(JavaScript\nmust be enabled to view this email address).

    "title": "Santa Maria Protest Over George Floyd Case Becomes March, Sit-In",
    "html": "<p>Approximately 400 people gathered in front of <location>Santa Maria City Hall</location> for a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon before marching in the traffic lanes in response to the death of <person>George Floyd</person>, a black man who died at the knee of a white <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer on <chron>Memorial Day</chron>.</p>\n<p>Later, after many demonstrators left, others gathered to sit in the middle of the intersection at <location>Broadway</location> and <location>Cook Street</location> as drivers revved their engines and screeched tires in support.</p>\n\n<p>As of <chron>9 p.m.</chron>, a small group remained at the scene and removed at least one American flag displayed on the corner. Authorities also responded to a stabbing victim in the area as the once peaceful event took on a different personality.</p>\n\n<p>The actions in the name of <org>Black Lives Matter</org> attracted people of all races who called for reforms with chants of \"Say his name!\" answered by \"<person>George Floyd</person>!\"</p>\n\n<p>Floyd, 46, died <chron>May 25</chron> while in police custody. A bystander's viral cellphone video showed Officer <person>Derek Chauvin</person> kneeling on the handcuffed man's neck for nearly nine minutes while he repeatedly exclaimed, \"I can't breathe.\" Floyd was nonresponsive for the last three minutes of the video.</p>\n\n<p>Chauvin, 44, and three other officers were fired the next day, and Chauvin was arrested and charged <chron>May 29</chron> with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p>\n\n<p>The incident prompted revulsion across the nation, along with peaceful protests against racism and police brutality - and widespread rioting.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanria\">Santa Maria</location> protest, peaceful demonstrations were held Sunday in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sntaba\">Santa Barbara</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanspo\">San Luis Obispo</location> and in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.lompoc\">Lompoc</location> on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>More than once, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanria\">Santa Maria</location> organizers called for participants to kneel on one knee - symbolic of the action that led to Floyd's death as well as the controversial protest waged by former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> 49ers quarterback <person>Colin Kaepernick</person> to highlight police brutality.</p>\n\n<p>Amid the ongoing coronavirus public health emergency, most in attendance wore various types of masks. A bottle of hand sanitizer was taped to an anti-tobacco sign in front of <location>City Hall</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Speakers also urged demonstrators to maintain social distancing but most people stood closer than 6 feet.</p>\n\n<p>At one point, an organizer used the microphone to issue a warning about instigators in the crowd and calling for protesters to avoid reacting.</p>\n\n<p>For some participants, including members of Showing Up for Racial Justice, Sunday's protest marked the second action in a week. Several protesters attended last weekend's demonstration at the <location>Lompoc Federal Correctional Complex</location> to highlight inmate conditions there.</p>\n\n<p>As protesters stood in front of <location>City Hall</location>, passing drivers honked horns or held cellphones to record the protest. One motorcyclist drove by several times, sometimes performing a wheelie while doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly two hours into the protest, the crowd began marching south on <location>Broadway</location> to <location>Stowell Road</location> a mile away before turning north. People chanted and waved signs while walking in traffic lanes along the route as vehicles traveled behind them.</p>\n\n<p>Other than occasional patrol officers driving by, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanria\">Santa Maria</location> police remained away from the scene.</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday, the department posted on its Twitter feed that the agency \"wants to thank our community for the peaceful protest.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We know our community and know we will get through this together,\" the post said. \"Thank you for your cooperation and support.\"</p>\n\n<p>Even as protesters took up spots in the intersection Sunday evening, police stayed more than a block away.</p>\n\n<p>The group eventually moved toward <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:M\">Macy's</org> at the <location>Santa Maria Town Center</location> before returning to the intersection of <location>Broadway</location> and <location>Cook Street</location>.</p>\n\n<p>As protesters took up position near <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:M\">Macy's</org> to shoot off fireworks and spin out, a black man on a bicycle noted the action more than a block away.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is uncalled for,\" he said. \"It is not honoring him (Floyd) at all.\"</p>\n\n<p>Instead of the peaceful protest earlier, the Sunday night crowd appeared to include newcomers who had not participated in the earlier events.</p>\n\n<p>Late Sunday, some members in the crowd targeted an American flag flying on the corner and a small fire burned in the roadway.</p>\n\n<p>Veterans vowed on social media to replace the flag as others worked to identify the people responsible for the vandalism.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to vandalism, those involved Sunday night also brought violence.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanria\">Santa Maria</location> police confirmed that a male stabbing victim was transported by Calstar medical helicopter to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2344337601\">Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital</org>. Additional information, including extent of injuries, was not immediately available.</p>\n\n<p>Police also said some of the demonstrators had entered the mall as of late Sunday night.</p>\n\n<p>Due to riots in other communities and local protests, Target and other businesses reportedly closed early in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanria\">Santa Maria</location> on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>- Noozhawk North County editor <person>Janene Scully</person> can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).
