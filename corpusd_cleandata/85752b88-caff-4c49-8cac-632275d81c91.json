    "text": "Editor,\n\nThe easiest thing to do when confronted with the brutality of the video\ndocumenting the death of George Floyd is to say, \"I can't watch this.\" That is\nexactly how I reacted. And I was wrong. Every white person over age 18 needs\nto watch it, more than once.\n\nWe hate to watch it, of course, because it is so ugly and so violent. We hate\nto watch it because deep down we understand it is not really about one bad cop\nor even many bad cops, but about who we are as a nation. It is yet another in\na long line of horrifying examples of systemic, institutionalized racist\nbehaviors that have been sanctioned at the highest levels of government\nthroughout our nation's history. The video drives the latest nail into the\ncoffin of the comforting narrative we tell ourselves about \"American\nexceptionalism.\"\n\nThe video shows a black man lying prone on the street, his hands handcuffed\nbehind his back. He gasps, \"Help me, I can't breathe.\" White police officer\nDerek Chauvin presses his knee into the back of Mr. Floyd's neck. \"Please,\"\nFloyd pleads, \"please help me.\" Three other police officers stand by for six\nminutes until one of them announces, \"I can't find a pulse.\" Chauvin continues\napplying pressure for nearly three additional minutes. The other officers\ncontinue to do nothing. Nine minutes pass. George Floyd is pronounced dead on\narrival at the hospital.\n\n\"Yes,\" so many of us in the white community are saying, \"it was terrible. But\nthe protests and the rioting are inexcusable.\" To those I would ask a few\nquestions: How much violence and social inequality can be perpetrated on black\nAmericans before they explode? Is George Floyd's death a singular incident or\njust the most recent case of police brutality that have prematurely ended the\nlives of many black men and women? Ahmad Arbery gunned down while jogging.\nEric Garner choked to death for selling loose cigarettes. Sean Reed shot\nseveral times in the back after a foot chase. Breonna Taylor and Atatiana\nJefferson killed in their homes. Philando Castile, Michael Brown, Charles\nKinsey, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray. The list is endless.\n\nThink of these victims as fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,\ncousins and children, because they were. And they were all human beings. And\nthey all bled the exact same color of red. Take that final leap and imagine\none of them was your parent or, worse, your child. Would you be quietly\ncontemplating the futility of violence? I know with certainty that had it been\nmy father or one of my children, my rage would not be easily contained. Ask\nwhy you find yourself more upset by damage done to property than by the loss\nof human lives. And ask if there is any reason black Americans are shot and\nkilled by police at a rate twice that of white Americans.\n\nWe need drastic change. We cannot continue to watch the needless suffering of\nour brothers and sisters and call ourselves either Americans or Christians. As\nlong as we continue to allow the brutalization of an entire race, we are\nneither.\n\nBob Curry\n\nDRUMS",

    "html": "<p>Editor,</p>\n<p>The easiest thing to do when confronted with the brutality of the video documenting the death of <person>George Floyd</person> is to say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t watch this.&#8221; That is exactly how I reacted. And I was wrong. Every white person over age 18 needs to watch it, more than once.</p>\n<p>We hate to watch it, of course, because it is so ugly and so violent. We hate to watch it because deep down we understand it is not really about one bad cop or even many bad cops, but about who we are as a nation. It is yet another in a long line of horrifying examples of systemic, institutionalized racist behaviors that have been sanctioned at the highest levels of government throughout our nation&#8217;s history. The video drives the latest nail into the coffin of the comforting narrative we tell ourselves about &#8220;American exceptionalism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The video shows a black man lying prone on the street, his hands handcuffed behind his back. He gasps, &#8220;Help me, I can&#8217;t breathe.&#8221; White police officer <person>Derek Chauvin</person> presses his knee into the back of Mr. Floyd&#8217;s neck. &#8220;Please,&#8221; Floyd pleads, &#8220;please help me.&#8221; Three other police officers stand by for six minutes until one of them announces, &#8220;I can&#8217;t find a pulse.&#8221; Chauvin continues applying pressure for nearly three additional minutes. The other officers continue to do nothing. Nine minutes pass. <person>George Floyd</person> is pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; so many of us in the white community are saying, &#8220;it was terrible. But the protests and the rioting are inexcusable.&#8221; To those I would ask a few questions: How much violence and social inequality can be perpetrated on black Americans before they explode? Is George Floyd&#8217;s death a singular incident or just the most recent case of police brutality that have prematurely ended the lives of many black men and women? <person>Ahmad Arbery</person> gunned down while jogging. <person>Eric Garner</person> choked to death for selling loose cigarettes. <person>Sean Reed</person> shot several times in the back after a foot chase. <person>Breonna Taylor</person> and Atatiana Jefferson killed in their homes. <person>Philando Castile</person>, <person>Michael Brown</person>, <person>Charles Kinsey</person>, <person>Sandra Bland</person>, <person>Freddie Gray</person>. The list is endless.</p>\n<p>Think of these victims as fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, cousins and children, because they were. And they were all human beings. And they all bled the exact same color of red. Take that final leap and imagine one of them was your parent or, worse, your child. Would you be quietly contemplating the futility of violence? I know with certainty that had it been my father or one of my children, my rage would not be easily contained. Ask why you find yourself more upset by damage done to property than by the loss of human lives. And ask if there is any reason black Americans are shot and killed by police at a rate twice that of white Americans.</p>\n<p>We need drastic change. We cannot continue to watch the needless suffering of our brothers and sisters and call ourselves either Americans or Christians. As long as we continue to allow the brutalization of an entire race, we are neither.</p>\n<p><person>Bob Curry</person></p>\n<p>DRUMS</p>",
