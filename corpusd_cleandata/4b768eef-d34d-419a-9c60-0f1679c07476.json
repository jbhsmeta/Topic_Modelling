    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, FL-While the most of the country protests the police killing of\nGeorge Floyd in Minnesota, protesters in Tallahassee were fueled by its own\npolice killings. Three deadly police shootings since March 20 were at the\ncenter of a large protest in Tallahassee on Saturday. Coupled with that fact\nthat they occurred under the watch of new police chief Lawrence Revell, who\nwas installed in December, protest leaders formed the march to express\nconcerns over what they began to see as a pattern.\n\nFollowing the sudden resignation of its chief of police in June of 2019,\nTallahassee residents began to express concern over what they saw as a\npeculiar search where the city was set to name an African American as its next\npolice chief with the contract all but signed. Suddenly, Antonio Gilliam, who\nwas currently the assistant police chief in St. Petersburg, rescinded his\nacceptance of the position over a contract dispute. In short order, another of\nthe finalists, Revell was named Tallahassee Chief of Police.\n\nSome Tallahasseans were skeptical with the way Revell s appointment evolved,\ncreating a mistrust among citizens in some circles.\n\nThe fatal shootings of Mychael Johnson (Mar. 20), Wilbon Woodrow (May 20), and\ntransgender male Tony McDade (May 29), coupled with the country s unrest over\nthe very public and deliberate death of Floyd, ignited a powder keg that\nresulted in the protest. Revell himself had been involved and cleared in an\nincident where he fatally shot a Black male in 1996.\n\nTesia Lisbon, a Florida A&M University student, was at the center of the\norganization of the march and was the vocal leader at the event. The people\nwho are Black in this city, the people who support Black people in this city\nhave watched and seen and heard about three people dying under the direction\nof Chief Revell. We have not heard of any indictments and no tapes have been\nreleased. We have sat and watched Tallahassee police get away with a lot of\nthings and we re not taking it anymore, she said.\n\nSaturday s protest was not without incident though.\n\nThe protest began around 11 AM traveling to Monroe street, the main street of\nTallahassee that houses the Florida Capitol. As TPD tried to turn the march\ntoward an off-street, an angry truck of three white men from Georgia\ndeliberately rammed through the crowd in a red pickup truck, hitting\nprotestors. The driver yelled White supremacy among other things as he was\nbeing arrested by TPD.\n\nA FAMU professor, who spoke on terms of anonymity, got involved to try to\nfoster a safe environment for the crowd of mostly students from FAMU, Florida\nState University and Tallahassee Community College. Several high school\nstudents were also a part of the demonstration.\n\nI m here because I knew we would have a lot of students participating. It got\nvery tense when the motorist revved his engine and ran right into the crowd.\nYou could hear the thuds of their bodies being hit by the vehicle. The truck\nstopped momentarily as some of the kids tried to reach in and turn off the\nvehicle. The driver revved the engine again and hit even more bodies before\nthe police were able to apprehend him, she said.\n\nArkia Gordon was traumatized by the incident. All I hear is the tires\nscreeching over and over again. I looked straight into his eyes like I was\nlooking into the eyes of evil. The main reason I was out there is because I\nwanted to be heard. I wanted to let the people of Tallahassee know that even\nthough this (Floyd) happened in Minnesota, it has happened in Florida before.\nI wanted them to\n\nContinue reading online at:\n[thewestsidegazette.com](http://thewestsidegazette.com)",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">TALLAHASSEE, FL</location>-While the most of the country protests the police killing of <person>George Floyd</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location>, protesters in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> were fueled by its own police killings. Three deadly police shootings since <chron>March 20</chron> were at the center of a large protest in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> on Saturday. Coupled with that fact that they occurred under the watch of new police chief <person>Lawrence Revell</person>, who was installed in December, protest leaders formed the march to express concerns over what they began to see as a pattern.</p>\n<p>Following the sudden resignation of its chief of police in June of 2019, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> residents began to express concern over what they saw as a peculiar search where the city was set to name an <org>African American</org> as its next police chief with the contract all but signed. Suddenly, <person>Antonio Gilliam</person>, who was currently the assistant police chief in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.saiurg\">St. Petersburg</location>, rescinded his acceptance of the position over a contract dispute. In short order, another of the finalists, Revell was named <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> Chief of Police.</p>\n<p>Some Tallahasseans were skeptical with the way Revell s appointment evolved, creating a mistrust among citizens in some circles.</p>\n<p>The fatal shootings of <person>Mychael Johnson</person> (<chron>Mar. 20</chron>), <person>Wilbon Woodrow</person> (<chron>May 20</chron>), and transgender male <person>Tony McDade</person> (<chron>May 29</chron>), coupled with the country s unrest over the very public and deliberate death of Floyd, ignited a powder keg that resulted in the protest. Revell himself had been involved and cleared in an incident where he fatally shot a Black male in 1996.</p>\n<p><person>Tesia Lisbon</person>, a <org>Florida A&amp;M University</org> student, was at the center of the organization of the march and was the vocal leader at the event. The people who are Black in this city, the people who support Black people in this city have watched and seen and heard about three people dying under the direction of <person>Chief Revell</person>. We have not heard of any indictments and no tapes have been released. We have sat and watched <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> police get away with a lot of things and we re not taking it anymore, she said.</p>\n<p>Saturday s protest was not without incident though.</p>\n<p>The protest began around <chron>11 AM</chron> traveling to Monroe street, the main street of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> that houses the Florida Capitol. As TPD tried to turn the march toward an off-street, an angry truck of three white men from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ga\">Georgia</location> deliberately rammed through the crowd in a red pickup truck, hitting protestors. The driver yelled White supremacy among other things as he was being arrested by TPD.</p>\n<p>A <org>FAMU</org> professor, who spoke on terms of anonymity, got involved to try to foster a safe environment for the crowd of mostly students from <org>FAMU</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1221904487\">Florida State University</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3726224297\">Tallahassee Community College</org>. Several high school students were also a part of the demonstration.</p>\n<p>I m here because I knew we would have a lot of students participating. It got very tense when the motorist revved his engine and ran right into the crowd. You could hear the thuds of their bodies being hit by the vehicle. The truck stopped momentarily as some of the kids tried to reach in and turn off the vehicle. The driver revved the engine again and hit even more bodies before the police were able to apprehend him, she said.</p>\n<p><person>Arkia Gordon</person> was traumatized by the incident. All I hear is the tires screeching over and over again. I looked straight into his eyes like I was looking into the eyes of evil. The main reason I was out there is because I wanted to be heard. I wanted to let the people of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location> know that even though this (Floyd) happened in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location>, it has happened in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> before.
