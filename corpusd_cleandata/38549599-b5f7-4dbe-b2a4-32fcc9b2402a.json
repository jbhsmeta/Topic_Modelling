    "text": "Annabelle Widra has been making her mark on the county since her eighth-grade\nyear as a starter for the Spain Park softball team.\n\nTime has flown over the last four years, but now, she's headed into her senior\nseason, and as a rising-senior, she was eligible for the 2020 North-South All-\nStar game.\n\nThanks to another strong junior year, Widra earned a spot on the North team,\nbecoming the county's only player to make the team during the shortened 2020\nseason.\n\nWhile the game won't be played, it still marks a high honor for the star.\n\n\"This is an outstanding group of softball standouts and coaches from our\nmember schools,\" AHSADCA Director Jamie Lee said. \"We are proud to announce\nthese teams even though we are disappointed the All-Star competition set for\nthe All-Star Sports Week this summer has been canceled. Each player will be\nreceiving certificates from the AHSADCA for their selection to these\nprestigious squads.\"\n\nIn her first three years as a starter, Widra was named the Shelby County\nPlayer of the Year, while also earning a spot on the All-County First Team\neach year.\n\nAs a pitcher and shortstop for the Jags, she has also been named a MaxPreps\nAll-American in the past.\n\nThis season alone, Widra posted a .549 batting average with 32 runs scored and\n25 RBIs at the plate, while going a perfect 9-0 in the circle with a 0.525 ERA\nand a remarkable 78 strikeouts in 40 innings.\n\nLast year, as a sophomore, Widra posted an ERA of 1.33 with a county-high 237\nstrikeouts. She allowed 26 earned runs in 137 innings and finished with a 22-2\nrecord.\n\nThis year, her impressive start had the Jaguars ranked No. 1 with a 21-0\nrecord, as she was looking to possibly post her best season of her career.\n\nEarning a spot on the team, made her one of the best 18 players in the North\nregion of the state and one of the 36 best in the entire state. She's also\ncommitted to play college softball at Michigan following her days at Spain\nPark, and is considered one of the top players in the country.\n\nShare this:\n\n* Twitter\n\n* Facebook",

    "html": "<p><person>Annabelle Widra</person> has been making her mark on the county since her eighth-grade year as a starter for the <location>Spain Park</location> softball team.</p>\n<p>Time has flown over the last four years, but now, she's headed into her senior season, and as a rising-senior, she was eligible for the 2020 North-South All-Star game.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to another strong junior year, Widra earned a spot on the North team, becoming the county's only player to make the team during the shortened 2020 season.</p>\n\n<p>While the game won't be played, it still marks a high honor for the star.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is an outstanding group of softball standouts and coaches from our member schools,\" AHSADCA Director <person>Jamie Lee</person> said. \"We are proud to announce these teams even though we are disappointed the All-Star competition set for the All-Star Sports Week this summer has been canceled. Each player will be receiving certificates from the AHSADCA for their selection to these prestigious squads.\"</p>\n\n<p>In her first three years as a starter, Widra was named the Shelby County Player of the Year, while also earning a spot on the All-County First Team each year.</p>\n\n<p>As a pitcher and shortstop for the Jags, she has also been named a MaxPreps All-American in the past.</p>\n\n<p>This season alone, Widra posted a .549 batting average with 32 runs scored and 25 RBIs at the plate, while going a perfect 9-0 in the circle with a 0.525 ERA and a remarkable 78 strikeouts in 40 innings.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, as a sophomore, Widra posted an ERA of 1.33 with a county-high 237 strikeouts. She allowed 26 earned runs in 137 innings and finished with a 22-2 record.</p>\n\n<p>This year, her impressive start had the Jaguars ranked No. 1 with a 21-0 record, as she was looking to possibly post her best season of her career.</p>\n\n<p>Earning a spot on the team, made her one of the best 18 players in the North region of the state and one of the 36 best in the entire state. She's also committed to play college softball at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location> following her days at <location>Spain Park</location>, and is considered one of the top players in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Share this:</p>\n\n<p>*  Twitter</p>\n\n<p>*  Facebook</p>",
