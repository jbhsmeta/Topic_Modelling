    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising --and exciting--\ntechnologies to come to the HVACR industry in a long time, and manufacturers\nare wasting no time in researching how it can be incorporated into their\nequipment. What makes AI so exciting is that it has benefits for virtually\neveryone, from the OEM to the contractor to the end user to the building\noccupant.\n\nFor OEMs, an AI-enabled rooftop unit or chiller could allow the collection of\nmassive amounts of real-time data that could be used to improve the design of\na product or optimize its operation. For contractors, AI predictive modeling\ncould foresee when a breakdown may occur, giving them time to fix the problem\nbefore it results in downtime. And the repair would be faster because the\nsystem would likely be able to diagnose itself.\n\nFor building owners and occupants, an AI-enabled HVAC system would\ncontinuously monitor and analyze conditions inside the space as well as\noutdoors, constantly making adjustments to the environment based on the data\nbeing collected. This could lead to not only more comfortable occupants but\nalso lower energy bills for building owners.\n\nEXCITING POSSIBILITIES\n\nWhile there is much excitement about all the opportunities that AI can offer,\nthe HVAC industry is still somewhat early on in how widely, and how well, it\nis applying AI, said Anthony Trifiletti, director, services portfolio, Trane\nCommercial HVAC Americas.\n\n\"When new AI opportunities are introduced to various industries, there is a\ncurve of adoption--with the HVAC business tending to be somewhat late\nadopters,\" he said. \"AI can run the gamut from a simple regression model all\nthe way to deep reinforcement learning, where the AI is dynamically learning\nall the time--which is really where we are headed as an industry. We have made\nsignificant strides in the AI space but certainly have more to go with the\ncontinuous expansion of new technology.\"\n\nThat said, Trane is using AI across its connected building and equipment\nportfolio, which is fast approaching 20,000 connected buildings and one\nmillion pieces of connected equipment in those systems, said Patrick Tonker,\ncommercialization strategy leader, Trane Commercial HVAC Americas.\n\n\"Today, AI takes the form of advanced analytics and robotic process automation\nthat allows us to automatically detect and diagnose issues that could impact\nour customers' buildings--spotting evaporator heat transfer issues or improper\noutside air damper operation, for example,\" he said.\n\nTrane thinks of AI in terms of overall systems, said Tonker, which means\nlooking at not just the equipment but the entire building and its automation\nsystem. While predicting and/or discovering issues are key factors in AI, the\nreal opportunity lies in the optimization of the entire system--applicable to\nboth chillers and rooftops, he said.\n\nBy providing continuous, dynamic optimization for customers and their\nbuildings, Trane is harnessing the power of AI, using machine learning, to\nkeep the human operator in the loop but reducing the need for decision making,\nsaid Tonker. This allows for more consistent performance, productivity gains,\nand a reallocation of resources to more value-added tasks.\n\n\"A customer may not know that AI is deployed as they are most interested in\nthe results; we recognize the value from the facility team as local subject\nmatter experts--and they are part of the overall solution,\" he said.\n\nDaikin Applied is also researching how to best utilize AI in its chillers and\nrooftops, and some of the analytics used in their Intelligent Equipment (IE)\nSolutions already have AI built into them, said Mike Schwartz, CEO of Daikin\nApplied.\n\n\"I'm convinced that as we go forward, these AI-enabled analytics will have the\nability to condense down a lot of data into usable, valuable actions,\" he\nsaid. \"For service technicians, AI will be able to give them direction on what\nthey need to do to fix the unit. For building owners and operators, they will\nbe able to pull out a cell phone and find out exactly how the units are\noperating and how much energy they're consuming.\"\n\nThe service aspect is particularly useful, said Schwartz, as contractors will\nbe able to monitor a customer's equipment remotely and be alerted if the\nsystem detects a problem. Then the service technician could be dispatched to\nthe customer's site to fix the issue before the customer even knows about it.\n\n\"This type of technology is going to be extremely powerful for customers,\nwhich is why we see it expanding exponentially in the future,\" he said.\n\nAI will definitely make life easier for both contractors and end users, noted\nTonker. Contractors will appreciate the predictive modeling that AI can offer,\nwhich will provide a boost to their preventive maintenance business. AI will\nalso make the installation and start-up process easier while helping to manage\nwarranty calls and aftermarket parts and supplies.\n\n\"From an end user perspective, we think of four main performance categories\nthat define potential customer benefits: comfort, energy savings, reliability,\nand compliance,\" he said. \"These are levers that different customers need to\npull to varying degrees, depending on their operational profile and\nobjectives. At the end of the day, the point of using AI at Trane is to\nconnect the performance of our customers' buildings to their business\nresults.\"\n\nPROBLEM SOLVER\n\nHaving the ability to continually manage and monitor HVAC equipment, including\nchillers and rooftops, is one of the main benefits of AI, said Dr. Barry Po,\npresident of connected solutions at mCloud Technologies, a provider of asset\nmanagement solutions that utilize AI and analytics for enhanced energy\nefficiency and building air quality.\n\n\"What if you had somebody who could pay attention to the equipment 24 hours a\nday, seven days a week, nonstop?\" he asked. \"How would that change the way in\nwhich building owners manage their chillers and boilers? And how would you\nthen be able to respond to issues before they become serious?\"\n\nThat is how AI creates value, said Po: building owners are able to have their\nassets intelligently managed via limitless computing in the cloud to eliminate\nunexpected downtime and equipment replacement while optimizing their total\ncost of ownership (TCO). This lies in contrast to what usually occurs today,\nwhich is that contractors conduct scheduled maintenance checks that may miss\nissues between visits or are simply summoned when the equipment fails.\n\n\"The great opportunity of AI is the ability to take existing assets and better\nmanage them with zero changes to the HVAC system design or the need for\nspecial on-site hardware,\" he said. \"AI gets eyes on the assets. That way,\nowners and operators can focus on more pressing issues.\"\n\nMaintenance is one of those issues that owners and operators would rather not\nworry about, and AI-enabled equipment will drive improvements in this area\nthat will enhance cost savings and production value, said Deepinder Singh, CEO\nand founder of 75F, which uses smart sensors and controls to make buildings\nmore comfortable and efficient.\n\n\"With AI, there is now the ability to process massive amounts of sensor data\nfaster than ever before,\" he said. \"What this does is gives companies a chance\nto improve their existing maintenance operations and possibly add something\nnew: predictive maintenance. Using AI to prevent faults inherently leads to a\nsecond benefit: creating a more comfortable environment for tenants. Humans\nare the ultimate sensor within a building, and companies are actively trying\nto find ways to personalize comfort for their occupants within a shared\nworkplace.\"\n\nAI TREND\n\nThere is no question that AI is a big breakthrough in technology, said Po, and\nthe goal now is to get more people on board.\n\n\"People continuously talk about how innovation in HVAC equipment comes from\nbuilding better hardware, but I think that completely misses the boat,\" he\nsaid. \"We don't need better engineering--there's a point where you can only\nmake an HVAC unit so efficient. The real potential is in optimizing unit\nperformance through better management and improved software.\"\n\nAnd as more OEMs incorporate AI into their HVAC equipment, there will be a\ntrend towards deeper integration of controls with their equipment as they seek\nto optimize performance and maximize value to their customers, said Singh.\n\n\"The integration of AI into chiller and rooftop controls has already begun. We\nexpect AI to be a feature of the majority of applied equipment sales within\nthree years and standard offering for all sales in five to seven years,\" he\nsaid.\n\nIndeed, there is a lot of interest in AI right now, especially in how the\ntechnology can be used to improve the performance of rooftops and chillers,\nsaid Tonker.\n\n\"I don't believe customers wake up saying, 'I want to buy an AI chiller\ntoday,' but they certainly wake up thinking, 'I wish I had more people to run\nmy buildings and more ways to understand how and when to optimize the\nperformance of my buildings,'\" he said. \"Those are the types of solutions end\nusers are looking for, which AI can deliver.\"\n\nCaption: USER INTERFACE: A look at the 75F Central Control Unit (CCU)\ndashboard in the field.

    "title": "Looking Ahead: The Promise of AI-Enabled Chillers and Rooftop Units.(HVACR TECHNOLOGY)",
    "html": "<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising --and\nexciting--technologies to come to the HVACR industry in a long time, and\nmanufacturers are wasting no time in researching how it can be\nincorporated into their equipment. What makes AI so exciting is that it\nhas benefits for virtually everyone, from the OEM to the contractor to\nthe end user to the building occupant.</p>\n\n<p>For OEMs, an AI-enabled rooftop unit or chiller could allow the\ncollection of massive amounts of real-time data that could be used to\nimprove the design of a product or optimize its operation. For\ncontractors, AI predictive modeling could foresee when a breakdown may\noccur, giving them time to fix the problem before it results in\ndowntime. And the repair would be faster because the system would likely\nbe able to diagnose itself.</p>\n\n<p>For building owners and occupants, an AI-enabled HVAC system would\ncontinuously monitor and analyze conditions inside the space as well as\noutdoors, constantly making adjustments to the environment based on the\ndata being collected. This could lead to not only more comfortable\noccupants but also lower energy bills for building owners.</p>\n\n<p>EXCITING POSSIBILITIES</p>\n\n<p>While there is much excitement about all the opportunities that AI\ncan offer, the HVAC industry is still somewhat early on in how widely,\nand how well, it is applying AI, said <person>Anthony Trifiletti</person>, director,\nservices portfolio, Trane Commercial HVAC Americas.</p>\n\n<p>\"When new AI opportunities are introduced to various\nindustries, there is a curve of adoption--with the HVAC business tending\nto be somewhat late adopters,\" he said. \"AI can run the gamut\nfrom a simple regression model all the way to deep reinforcement\nlearning, where the AI is dynamically learning all the time--which is\nreally where we are headed as an industry. We have made significant\nstrides in the AI space but certainly have more to go with the\ncontinuous expansion of new technology.\"</p>\n\n<p>That said, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:TT\">Trane</org> is using AI across its connected building and\nequipment portfolio, which is fast approaching 20,000 connected\nbuildings and one million pieces of connected equipment in those\nsystems, said <person>Patrick Tonker</person>, commercialization strategy leader, Trane\nCommercial HVAC Americas.</p>\n\n<p>\"Today, AI takes the form of advanced analytics and robotic\nprocess automation that allows us to automatically detect and diagnose\nissues that could impact our customers' buildings--spotting\nevaporator heat transfer issues or improper outside air damper\noperation, for example,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:TT\">Trane</org> thinks of AI in terms of overall systems, said Tonker, which\nmeans looking at not just the equipment but the entire building and its\nautomation system. While predicting and/or discovering issues are key\nfactors in AI, the real opportunity lies in the optimization of the\nentire system--applicable to both chillers and rooftops, he said.</p>\n\n<p>By providing continuous, dynamic optimization for customers and\ntheir buildings, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:TT\">Trane</org> is harnessing the power of AI, using machine\nlearning, to keep the human operator in the loop but reducing the need\nfor decision making, said Tonker. This allows for more consistent\nperformance, productivity gains, and a reallocation of resources to more\nvalue-added tasks.</p>\n\n<p>\"A customer may not know that AI is deployed as they are most\ninterested in the results; we recognize the value from the facility team\nas local subject matter experts--and they are part of the overall\nsolution,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0999017086\">Daikin Applied</org> is also researching how to best utilize AI in its\nchillers and rooftops, and some of the analytics used in their\nIntelligent Equipment (IE) Solutions already have AI built into them,\nsaid <person>Mike Schwartz</person>, CEO of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0999017086\">Daikin Applied</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm convinced that as we go forward, these AI-enabled\nanalytics will have the ability to condense down a lot of data into\nusable, valuable actions,\" he said. \"For service technicians,\nAI will be able to give them direction on what they need to do to fix\nthe unit. For building owners and operators, they will be able to pull\nout a cell phone and find out exactly how the units are operating and\nhow much energy they're consuming.\"</p>\n\n<p>The service aspect is particularly useful, said Schwartz, as\ncontractors will be able to monitor a customer's equipment remotely\nand be alerted if the system detects a problem. Then the service\ntechnician could be dispatched to the customer's site to fix the\nissue before the customer even knows about it.</p>\n\n<p>\"This type of technology is going to be extremely powerful for\ncustomers, which is why we see it expanding exponentially in the\nfuture,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>AI will definitely make life easier for both contractors and end\nusers, noted Tonker. Contractors will appreciate the predictive modeling\nthat AI can offer, which will provide a boost to their preventive\nmaintenance business. AI will also make the installation and start-up\nprocess easier while helping to manage warranty calls and aftermarket\nparts and supplies.</p>\n\n<p>\"From an end user perspective, we think of four main\nperformance categories that define potential customer benefits: comfort,\nenergy savings, reliability, and compliance,\" he said. \"These\nare levers that different customers need to pull to varying degrees,\ndepending on their operational profile and objectives. At the end of the\nday, the point of using AI at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:TT\">Trane</org> is to connect the performance of our\ncustomers' buildings to their business results.\"</p>\n\n<p>PROBLEM SOLVER</p>\n\n<p>Having the ability to continually manage and monitor HVAC\nequipment, including chillers and rooftops, is one of the main benefits\nof AI, said Dr. <person>Barry Po</person>, president of connected solutions at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"TorontoVE:MCLD\">mCloud\nTechnologies</org>, a provider of asset management solutions that utilize AI\nand analytics for enhanced energy efficiency and building air quality.</p>\n\n<p>\"What if you had somebody who could pay attention to the\nequipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week, nonstop?\" he asked.\n\"How would that change the way in which building owners manage\ntheir chillers and boilers? And how would you then be able to respond to\nissues before they become serious?\"</p>\n\n<p>That is how AI creates value, said Po: building owners are able to\nhave their assets intelligently managed via limitless computing in the\ncloud to eliminate unexpected downtime and equipment replacement while\noptimizing their total cost of ownership (TCO). This lies in contrast to\nwhat usually occurs today, which is that contractors conduct scheduled\nmaintenance checks that may miss issues between visits or are simply\nsummoned when the equipment fails.</p>\n\n<p>\"The great opportunity of AI is the ability to take existing\nassets and better manage them with zero changes to the HVAC system\ndesign or the need for special on-site hardware,\" he said. \"AI\ngets eyes on the assets. That way, owners and operators can focus on\nmore pressing issues.\"</p>\n\n<p>Maintenance is one of those issues that owners and operators would\nrather not worry about, and AI-enabled equipment will drive improvements\nin this area that will enhance cost savings and production value, said\n<person>Deepinder Singh</person>, CEO and founder of 75F, which uses smart sensors and\ncontrols to make buildings more comfortable and efficient.</p>\n\n<p>\"With AI, there is now the ability to process massive amounts\nof sensor data faster than ever before,\" he said. \"What this\ndoes is gives companies a chance to improve their existing maintenance\noperations and possibly add something new: predictive maintenance. Using\nAI to prevent faults inherently leads to a second benefit: creating a\nmore comfortable environment for tenants. Humans are the ultimate sensor\nwithin a building, and companies are actively trying to find ways to\npersonalize comfort for their occupants within a shared workplace.\"</p>\n\n<p>AI TREND</p>\n\n<p>There is no question that AI is a big breakthrough in technology,\nsaid Po, and the goal now is to get more people on board.</p>\n\n<p>\"People continuously talk about how innovation in HVAC\nequipment comes from building better hardware, but I think that\ncompletely misses the boat,\" he said. \"We don't need\nbetter engineering--there's a point where you can only make an HVAC\nunit so efficient. The real potential is in optimizing unit performance\nthrough better management and improved software.\"</p>\n\n<p>And as more OEMs incorporate AI into their HVAC equipment, there\nwill be a trend towards deeper integration of controls with their\nequipment as they seek to optimize performance and maximize value to\ntheir customers, said Singh.</p>\n\n<p>\"The integration of AI into chiller and rooftop controls has\nalready begun. We expect AI to be a feature of the majority of applied\nequipment sales within three years and standard offering for all sales\nin five to seven years,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, there is a lot of interest in AI right now, especially in\nhow the technology can be used to improve the performance of rooftops\nand chillers, said Tonker.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't believe customers wake up saying, 'I want\nto buy an AI chiller today,' but they certainly wake up thinking,\n'I wish I had more people to run my buildings and more ways to\nunderstand how and when to optimize the performance of my\nbuildings,'\" he said. \"Those are the types of solutions\nend users are looking for, which AI can deliver.\"</p>\n\n<p>Caption: USER INTERFACE: A look at the 75F <org>Central Control Unit</org>\n(CCU) dashboard in the field.
