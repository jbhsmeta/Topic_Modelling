    "text": "There is more to Michael Guyot than graduating at the top of his class.\n\nMake no mistake, the 18-year-old is proud of serving as the valedictorian for\nBartram Trail High School's 20th graduating class. But he found there are so\nmany talented and creative people within the halls of his school, that\ngraduating with a 4.68 grade point average does not make him any more special\nthan his peers.\n\n\"It's taken a lot of sacrifice, but I don't think it's that much different\nthan everyone else's high school experience,\" Guyot told The Record.\n\nThe last four years were all about challenging himself in the classroom and\nelsewhere. Now that this chapter has come to a close, Guyot said those trials\nwere worthwhile.\n\n\"It did teach me to prioritize,\" he said. \"I knew my priorities were with\nacademics. It was good to see how far I could go with athletics and\nacademics.\"\n\nGuyot graduates as a champion on both fronts. In addition to finishing atop\nhis class, he helped the Bears tennis team win a FHSAA state championship in\n2018.\n\nBartram Trail was the first Northeast Florida boys tennis team to win a state\ntitle in 95 years.\n\nWhen he was not service aces on the court, or earning them in the classroom,\nGuyot spent as much time as he could with animals. He and friends helped\ncreate a Humane Society club on campus so Bartram Trail students could play\nwith pets and connect with an organization that has attempted to foster and\nassist animals of all stripes.\n\nGuyot will enroll at the University of Florida this fall. He plans to study\nbiomedical engineering.\n\nAs he makes the transition beyond high school, he doesn't think about the\ntriumphs or conquests. His fondest memories will be of people.\n\n\"Seeing all my friends and teachers who were there for me every day,\ninteracting with them and getting to know them was the best part,\" Guyot said.\n\"It wasn't one thing. It was the collective of small interactions with those\npeople.\"\n\nEditor's note: To honor St. Johns County high school graduates, The St.\nAugustine Record plans to publish a list of all graduates at a later date.",

But he found there are so many talented and creative people within the halls of his school, that graduating with a 4.68 grade point average does not make him any more special than his peers.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's taken a lot of sacrifice, but I don't think it's that much different than everyone else's high school experience,\" Guyot told The Record.</p>\n\n<p>The last four years were all about challenging himself in the classroom and elsewhere. Now that this chapter has come to a close, Guyot said those trials were worthwhile.</p>\n\n<p>\"It did teach me to prioritize,\" he said. \"I knew my priorities were with academics. It was good to see how far I could go with athletics and academics.\"</p>\n\n<p>Guyot graduates as a champion on both fronts. In addition to finishing atop his class, he helped the Bears tennis team win a FHSAA state championship in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Bartram Trail was the first <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Northeast Florida</location> boys tennis team to win a state title in 95 years.</p>\n\n<p>When he was not service aces on the court, or earning them in the classroom, Guyot spent as much time as he could with animals. He and friends helped create a <org>Humane Society</org> club on campus so Bartram Trail students could play with pets and connect with an organization that has attempted to foster and assist animals of all stripes.</p>\n\n<p>Guyot will enroll at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1276336060\">University of Florida</org> this fall. He plans to study biomedical engineering.</p>\n\n<p>As he makes the transition beyond high school, he doesn't think about the triumphs or conquests. His fondest memories will be of people.</p>\n\n<p>\"Seeing all my friends and teachers who were there for me every day, interacting with them and getting to know them was the best part,\" Guyot said. \"It wasn't one thing. It was the collective of small interactions with those people.\"</p>\n\n<p>Editor's note: To honor <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.saihns\">St. Johns County</location> high school graduates, The St. Augustine Record plans to publish a list of all graduates at a later date.</p>",
