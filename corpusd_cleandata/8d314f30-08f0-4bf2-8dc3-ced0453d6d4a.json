    "text": "Jenks senior Will Edwards had a fantastic junior soccer season, but the\ncoronavirus cheated him out of an encore.\n\nThe Gatorade Company helped make up for it Monday by naming Edwards as its\nOklahoma male soccer player of the year for the second straight season.\n\nEdwards had 14 goals and eight assists last year, helping lead the Trojans to\nan 18-0 record, the 6A state championship and the No. 2 final ranking in the\nUSA Today/United Soccer Coaches' Super 25.\n\nHe had four goals and four assists in the Trojans' four 2020 games before the\ncoronavirus pandemic struck, ending his senior year. He totaled 40 goals and\n27 assists over four varsity seasons.\n\n\"Will is the type of player who can turn a game on its head,\" Jenks coach Eric\nMarshall said in a Gatorade news release.\n\n\"He can take on players in and around the box to score a goal. He can start a\ncounterattack with a well-placed through ball, or penetrate on the dribble to\nopen up space for other players. He's a very intelligent player who has been a\nleader on and off the field.\"\n\nEdwards also helped lead the Trojans to a state runner-up finish as a\nsophomore and was part of 40 wins over four seasons. He is a two-time All\nWorld selection by the Tulsa World.\n\nHe is the seventh Jenks player to receive the Gatorade Award but the first\ntwo-time recipient. Other Trojans winners were Eric Littlepage (1997); Hudson\nBlake (1996); Robbie Burns (1993); Gary Graham (1991); Mark Haston (1990) and\nDavid Gordon (1989).\n\nGatorade is in its 35th year of honoring the best high school athletes in all\n50 states and the District of Columbia. The award recognizes athletic\nperformance, academic excellence and exemplary character on and off the field.\n\nEdwards served on his school's student council and volunteered locally on\nbehalf of the Make-a-Wish Foundation as well as a youth summer camp. He\nmaintained a 3.71 GPA and is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n\nHe is now eligible for selection as national male soccer player of the year,\nan award which will be announced later this month.\n\nFeatured Sports Video: Tulsa Drillers president/GM Mike Melega on ONEOK\nField's all-decade team\n\nAll World finalists for athlete of the year: See honorees in basketball,\nfootball, softball, cross country, volleyball, wrestling and swimming",

He totaled 40 goals and 27 assists over four varsity seasons.</p>\n\n<p>\"Will is the type of player who can turn a game on its head,\" Jenks coach <person>Eric Marshall</person> said in a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1548576834\">Gatorade</org> news release.</p>\n\n<p>\"He can take on players in and around the box to score a goal. He can start a counterattack with a well-placed through ball, or penetrate on the dribble to open up space for other players. He's a very intelligent player who has been a leader on and off the field.\"</p>\n\n<p>Edwards also helped lead the Trojans to a state runner-up finish as a sophomore and was part of 40 wins over four seasons. He is a two-time <org>All World</org> selection by the <org>Tulsa World</org>.</p>\n\n<p>He is the seventh <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.jenks\">Jenks</location> player to receive the Gatorade Award but the first two-time recipient.

The award recognizes athletic performance, academic excellence and exemplary character on and off the field.</p>\n\n<p>Edwards served on his school's student council and volunteered locally on behalf of the <org>Make-a-Wish Foundation</org> as well as a youth summer camp. He maintained a 3.71 GPA and is a member of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1991452535\">Fellowship of Christian Athletes</org>.</p>\n\n<p>He is now eligible for selection as national male soccer player of the year, an award which will be announced later this month.</p>\n\n<p>Featured Sports Video: Tulsa Drillers president/GM <person>Mike Melega</person> on ONEOK Field's all-decade team</p>\n\n<p>All World finalists for athlete of the year: See honorees in basketball, football, softball, cross country, volleyball, wrestling and swimming</p>",
