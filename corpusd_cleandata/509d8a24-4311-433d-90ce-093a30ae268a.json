    "text": "Attorney General Ashley Moody today released the 2020 Hurricane Preparedness\nGuide. The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season began Monday and runs through the\nend of November. Moody is urging Floridians to review the preparedness guide\nnow and understand that planning will be different this year as Floridians\ncontinue to take measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"As Floridians, we know that hurricanes are an unfortunate reality of living\nin our beautiful state,\" Moody said in a press release about the start-of-\nseason. \"As we continue to deal with the challenges presented by COVID-19, it\nis equally important that we not drop the ball on our preparedness for\nhurricane season. The safety of you, your family, pets and property, depends\non you preparing now.\"\n\nEntering hurricane season with two named storms already, the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration is predicting the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane\nSeason to be extremely active with 13 to 19 named storms. The hurricane guide\nis meant to serve as a useful tool to help families prepare with tips,\nresources and information.\n\nBelow are some important hurricane preparedness tips from the guide:\n\n\u00bb Know evacuation routes, noting that some shelters may not be open this year\ndue to COVID-19;\n\n\u00bb Stock up on food, water and emergency supplies-including supplies that can\nhelp protect you and others from COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer, cleaning\nmaterials and cloth face coverings;\n\n\u00bb Verify that storm-related products are actually hurricane-proof or impact-\nproof before purchasing;\n\n\u00bb After the storm, be wary of any contractor who approaches unsolicited or\noffers to perform repairs at a discount with leftover supplies from another\njob; and\n\nResearch recovery charities before giving, as solicitations increase following\na disaster and so do charity scams designed to profit off the goodwill of\nothers.\n\nWith the start of the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Moody will launch a\nweek-long Twitter campaign to encourage Floridians to prepare and stay\ninformed about storm-related scams. Follow the campaign on Twitter using\n#WeatherTheStormOAG. Moody also spoke of her agencies commitment to prevent\nprice gouging, which she said is one of the most common consumer complaints\nreported during hurricane season. Florida's price gouging laws are designed to\nprotect consumers from becoming victims for a second time after a disaster.\nThroughout a declared state of emergency, it is unlawful to sell essential\ncommodities for an amount that grossly exceeds the average price for that\ncommodity during the 30 days before the declaration.\n\nWhile Florida is currently under an emergency declaration due to the COVID-19\npandemic, consumers should know that essential commodities protected under the\ncurrent declaration differ from those covered during a hurricane declaration.\n\nFriday, May 29 also marked the beginning of the 2020 Disaster Preparedness\nSales Tax Holiday which lasts through Thursday, June 4. Floridians should\nprepare for hurricane season now by taking advantage of the tax break to save\non storm-related items, such as batteries, flashlights, radios, tie-down kits\nand more.\n\nThe 2020 Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday was passed by the Florida\nLegislature and signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDuring this sales tax holiday period, qualifying items related to disaster\npreparedness are exempt from sales tax. However, the sales tax holiday does\nnot apply to the rental or repair of any of the qualifying items.\nAdditionally, the sales tax holiday does not apply to sales in a theme park,\nentertainment complex, public lodging establishment or airport.\n\nQualifying Items\n\nSelling for $10 or less: Reusable ice (reusable ice packs).\n\nSelling for $20 or less: Any portable, self-powered light source (powered by\nbattery, solar, hand-crank, or gas), and including candles, flashlights and\nlanterns. Eligible light sources qualify for the exemption even if electrical\ncords are also included; coolers and ice chests (for food-storage,\nnonelectrical).\n\nSelling for $25 or less: Any gas or diesel fuel container, including LP gas\nand kerosene containers.\n\nSelling for $30 or less: Batteries, including rechargeable batteries, listed\nsizes only.

Keep your\nvehicle tanks filled with fuel. Maintain a list of important phone numbers\nincluding: County emergency management office, evacuation sites, doctors,\nbanks, schools, veterinarian, and numbers for out of town contacts, friends\nand family. Have a go-bag of clothing, including seasonal or rain gear and\nsturdy shoes or boots.\n\nHave at least a two-week supply of medication, medical supplies used regularly\nand a list of allergies.

    "html": "<p>Attorney General <person>Ashley Moody</person> today released the 2020 Hurricane Preparedness Guide. The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season began Monday and runs through the end of November. Moody is urging Floridians to review the preparedness guide now and understand that planning will be different this year as Floridians continue to take measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>\"As Floridians, we know that hurricanes are an unfortunate reality of living in our beautiful state,\" Moody said in a press release about the start-of-season. \"As we continue to deal with the challenges presented by COVID-19, it is equally important that we not drop the ball on our preparedness for hurricane season. The safety of you, your family, pets and property, depends on you preparing now.\"</p>\n\n<p>Entering hurricane season with two named storms already, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0035058886\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</org> is predicting the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season to be extremely active with 13 to 19 named storms. The hurricane guide is meant to serve as a useful tool to help families prepare with tips, resources and information.</p>\n\n<p>Below are some important hurricane preparedness tips from the guide:</p>\n\n<p>&#187; Know evacuation routes, noting that some shelters may not be open this year due to COVID-19;</p>\n\n<p>&#187; Stock up on food, water and emergency supplies-including supplies that can help protect you and others from COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer, cleaning materials and cloth face coverings;</p>\n\n<p>&#187; Verify that storm-related products are actually hurricane-proof or impact-proof before purchasing;</p>\n\n<p>&#187; After the storm, be wary of any contractor who approaches unsolicited or offers to perform repairs at a discount with leftover supplies from another job; and</p>\n\n<p> Research recovery charities before giving, as solicitations increase following a disaster and so do charity scams designed to profit off the goodwill of others.</p>\n\n<p>With the start of the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Moody will launch a week-long Twitter campaign to encourage Floridians to prepare and stay informed about storm-related scams. Follow the campaign on Twitter using #WeatherTheStormOAG. Moody also spoke of her agencies commitment to prevent price gouging, which she said is one of the most common consumer complaints reported during hurricane season. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> price gouging laws are designed to protect consumers from becoming victims for a second time after a disaster. Throughout a declared state of emergency, it is unlawful to sell essential commodities for an amount that grossly exceeds the average price for that commodity during the 30 days before the declaration.</p>\n\n<p>While <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> is currently under an emergency declaration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers should know that essential commodities protected under the current declaration differ from those covered during a hurricane declaration.</p>\n\n<p><chron>Friday, May 29</chron> also marked the beginning of the 2020 Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday which lasts through <chron>Thursday, June 4</chron>. Floridians should prepare for hurricane season now by taking advantage of the tax break to save on storm-related items, such as batteries, flashlights, radios, tie-down kits and more.</p>\n\n<p>The 2020 Disaster Preparedness Sales Tax Holiday was passed by the <org>Florida Legislature</org> and signed into law by Gov. <person>Ron DeSantis</person>.</p>\n\n<p>During this sales tax holiday period, qualifying items related to disaster preparedness are exempt from sales tax. However, the sales tax holiday does not apply to the rental or repair of any of the qualifying items. Additionally, the sales tax holiday does not apply to sales in a theme park, entertainment complex, public lodging establishment or airport.</p>\n\n<p>Qualifying Items</p>\n\n<p>Selling for <money>$10</money> or less: Reusable ice (reusable ice packs).</p>\n\n<p>Selling for <money>$20</money> or less: Any portable, self-powered light source (powered by battery, solar, hand-crank, or gas), and including candles, flashlights and lanterns.
