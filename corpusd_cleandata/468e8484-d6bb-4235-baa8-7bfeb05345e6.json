    "text": "A TEEN has kept busy during lockdown by making scrubs for NHS workers.\n\nHenry Bushell, a Year 11 student at Richmond School, has worked alongside his\nmum and other volunteers to sew together scrubs for healthcare workers.\n\nSo far, Henry and his mum have made 50 sets of scrubs.\n\nWhen the volunteers started making scrubs, towards the end of March, they were\nbuying the fabric themselves until family friend Mel Websdale set up a Go Fund\nMe page and immediately raised more than \u00a3600.\n\nFabric was ordered from suppliers all over the country, as companies were\nstruggling to keep up with orders as there were, and still are, many\nindividuals across the UK who are sewing scrubs for their local hospitals.\n\nAs demand increased in April, Henry offered to help by making scrub trousers.\nAlthough having only sewn in his textiles classes in Years 7 and 8 at school,\nhe was a fast learner, learning how to sew the seams and hem the trousers, and\nhe is very quick and proficient.\n\nHenry is now making face masks for a local barber and hairdresser. He made his\nfirst one for his dad and has since made masks for himself and friends. Henry\nsaid: I was more than happy to help but I never expected my sewing skills to\ncome in useful in this way!\"\n\nThe volunteers have supplied scrubs to Quaker Lane surgery, The Terrace House\nNursing Home, James Cook Hospital, Darlington Memorial Hospital, The Friarage\nHospital and a hospital in Harrogate. Sets have also and made for individual\ndoctors and nurses who needed them but were unable to get any.\n\nJenna Potter, Headteacher, commented: \"I am very impressed with Henry's\nmotivation and drive to produce scrubs and masks which are in such demand by\nhealthcare professionals and other key workers. It is extremely kind of him to\ndedicate so much time to support others and I admire and applaud him for this,\nas I am sure do those who have benefited from his valued work.\"",

Although having only sewn in his textiles classes in Years 7 and 8 at school, he was a fast learner, learning how to sew the seams and hem the trousers, and he is very quick and proficient.</p>\n<p>Henry is now making face masks for a local barber and hairdresser. He made his first one for his dad and has since made masks for himself and friends. Henry said: I was more than happy to help but I never expected my sewing skills to come in useful in this way!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The volunteers have supplied scrubs to <location>Quaker Lane</location> surgery, <org>The Terrace House Nursing Home</org>, <org>James Cook Hospital</org>, <org>Darlington Memorial Hospital</org>, <org>The Friarage Hospital</org> and a hospital in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.harrog\">Harrogate</location>. Sets have also and made for individual doctors and nurses who needed them but were unable to get any.</p>\n<p><person>Jenna Potter</person>, Headteacher, commented: \"I am very impressed with Henry&#8217;s motivation and drive to produce scrubs and masks which are in such demand by healthcare professionals and other key workers. It is extremely kind of him to dedicate so much time to support others and I admire and applaud him for this, as I am sure do those who have benefited from his valued work.&#8221;</p>",
