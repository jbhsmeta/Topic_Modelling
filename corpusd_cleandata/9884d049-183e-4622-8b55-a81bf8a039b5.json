    "text": "Blue Ridge Specialty Group of Greenfield, South Carolina, a managing general\nunderwriter specializing in trucking -related risks, has been acquired by\nApplied Underwriters, according to Applied Chairman and CEO Steve Menzies.\n\nBlue Ridge, which works with agents and brokers, will retain its operations in\nSouth Carolina; the company will continue to be headed by its principals and\nco-founders, Mike Gordon and Shane Dennie.\n\nMenzies said the addition of Blue Ridge sets complementary services into\ncombination as Applied continues its expansion into the property/casualty\ninsurance space.\n\nApplied Underwriters acquired Centauri Specialty Managers on March 31, 2020\nfrom its primary shareholder AXA/XL, and third party administrator Siebels-\nBruce. As part its purchase of CSM, Applied Underwriters also has an exclusive\noption to buy the Centauri holding company's two insurance carriers Centauri\nSpecialty Insurance Co. and Centauri National Insurance Co. Applied said it\nplans to complete the acquisition of the Centauri carriers upon regulatory\napproval later this year. The acquisition was structured in steps, with the\nfirst step completed on March 31, to ensure the continuity of Centauri's\nDemotech A rating, according to Applied.\n\nApplied, known as a workers' compensation expert, said it will use the\nCentauri companies to expand nationally into other lines of property/casualty\ninsurance. Centauri writes residential property, commercial lines, flood and\nother lines.\n\nApplied Underwriters is a global risk services firm offering business\nservices, insurance, and reinsurance solutions. Applied Underwriters operates\nthroughout the U.S. from its operational headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.",
