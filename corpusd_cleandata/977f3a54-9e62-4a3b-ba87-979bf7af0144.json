    "text": "Jun. 5\\--The NCAA Division I Council approved a waiver that will allow Central\nMichigan's football program to remain in the Football Bowl Subdivision and\ngive the school two years to bring the total number of men's programs up to\nFBS compliance, athletic director Michael Alford announced Thursday.\n\nThe waiver expires after the 2021-22 academic year.\n\n\"We continue to research and determine the best course of action to return the\ndepartment to full compliance,\" Alford said in a statement.\n\nCMU fell beneath the FBS threshold requiring six men's programs when it\ndiscontinued its men's indoor and outdoor track and field programs May 19 to\ncombat financial shortcomings during the coronavirus pandemic. In doing so,\nCMU dropped from seven men's sports to five.\n\nIf the NCAA hadn't granted CMU relief, the university would have needed to add\nanother low-cost men's sport.\n\nIn April, the NCAA rejected a proposal from Group of Five conferences, which\nincludes the Mid-American Conference, requesting FBS requirements on varsity\nsports be relaxed in wake of the pandemic, according to ESPN.\n\n\"As I have said throughout this process,\" Alford said, \"through my various\nconversations I felt confident that everyone involved was understanding about\nour current financial situation and we look forward to returning to full\ncompliance.\"\n\nThe loss of men's track and field affected 36 student-athletes and is expected\nto save the athletic department $620,000 annually.\n\nBecause of budget restrictions, 12 Division I universities have cut more than\n20 athletic programs, beginning April 2 with Old Dominion's wrestling team.\n\nOf those teams, only one -- Bowling Green baseball -- was reinstated. Alumni\nand donors committed $1.5 million over the next three years to keep the\nprogram alive while the university seeks long-term funding options.\n\nAlford said men's track and field will not return, even if the financial\nsituation improves. There are no current plans to discontinue other sports.\n\nThe remaining 16 sponsored sports at CMU are men's and women's basketball,\nfootball, women's soccer, women's golf, baseball, softball, men's and women's\ncross country, field hockey, women's track and field, gymnastics, women's\nlacrosse, volleyball and wrestling.\n\nEvan Petzold is a sports reporting intern at the Detroit Free Press.

    "html": "<p><chron>Jun. 5</chron>--The <org>NCAA</org> Division I Council approved a waiver that will allow <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Central Michigan's</location> football program to remain in the Football Bowl Subdivision and give the school two years to bring the total number of men's programs up to <org>FBS</org> compliance, athletic director <person>Michael Alford</person> announced Thursday.</p>\n<p>The waiver expires after the 2021-22 academic year.</p>\n<p>\"We continue to research and determine the best course of action to return the department to full compliance,\" Alford said in a statement.</p>\n<p>CMU fell beneath the <org>FBS</org> threshold requiring six men's programs when it discontinued its men's indoor and outdoor track and field programs <chron>May 19</chron> to combat financial shortcomings during the coronavirus pandemic. In doing so, CMU dropped from seven men's sports to five.</p>\n<p>If the <org>NCAA</org> hadn't granted CMU relief, the university would have needed to add another low-cost men's sport.</p>\n<p>In April, the <org>NCAA</org> rejected a proposal from <org>Group of Five</org> conferences, which includes the <org>Mid-American Conference</org>, requesting <org>FBS</org> requirements on varsity sports be relaxed in wake of the pandemic, according to <org>ESPN</org>.</p>\n<p>\"As I have said throughout this process,\" Alford said, \"through my various conversations I felt confident that everyone involved was understanding about our current financial situation and we look forward to returning to full compliance.\"</p>\n<p>The loss of men's track and field affected 36 student-athletes and is expected to save the athletic department <money>$620,000</money> annually.</p>\n<p>Because of budget restrictions, 12 Division I universities have cut more than 20 athletic programs, beginning <chron>April 2</chron> with Old Dominion's wrestling team.</p>\n<p>Of those teams, only one -- Bowling Green baseball -- was reinstated. Alumni and donors committed <money>$1.5 million</money> over the next three years to keep the program alive while the university seeks long-term funding options.</p>\n<p>Alford said men's track and field will not return, even if the financial situation improves. There are no current plans to discontinue other sports.</p>\n<p>The remaining 16 sponsored sports at CMU are men's and women's basketball, football, women's soccer, women's golf, baseball, softball, men's and women's cross country, field hockey, women's track and field, gymnastics, women's lacrosse, volleyball and wrestling.</p>\n<p><person>Evan Petzold</person> is a sports reporting intern at the <org>Detroit Free Press</org>.
