This\noffers us a baseline and if this is being done correctly, and is continued, it\ncan be an important contribution to keeping us virus free by predicting\nhotspots.\n\nThis, together with testing (where is it??) and contact tracing (do we have\nANY?! or any prospects of contact tracing -- hiring, training tracers?) are\ncrucial factors in helping to address our coronavirus pandemic. Please keep\nthe info on this coming -- and why relegate it to the last page of the the\nfirst section? Seems to me, this should be Page 1, above the fold.\n\nWe have been fortunate to have low numbers so far in St. Augustine and St.\nJohns County, but things may change, especially if we have lots of summer\nvisitors -- I also read your article about all the money allocated to\nadvertising to attract tourists this summer. It seems to me our first priority\nis taking care to keep current residents healthy and alive. This means social\ndistancing, wearing masks, having testing readily available and taking\nadvantage of it, doing contact tracing -- oh wait. Am I repeating myself? I'm\nfrustrated with the poor attitude on the part of our leaders; I hope you get\nthe message, I wish everyone would get the message.\n\nThis really is a matter of life and death, and we need to see action taken by\nour leaders at all levels of government to help us with this.\n\nKathleen Jordan, St. Augustine",

This offers us a baseline and if this is being done correctly, and is continued, it can be an important contribution to keeping us virus free by predicting hotspots.</p>\n<p>This, together with testing (where is it??) and contact tracing (do we have ANY?! or any prospects of contact tracing &#8212; hiring, training tracers?) are crucial factors in helping to address our coronavirus pandemic. Please keep the info on this coming &#8212; and why relegate it to the last page of the the first section? Seems to me, this should be Page 1, above the fold.</p>\n\n<p>We have been fortunate to have low numbers so far in <person>St. Augustine</person> and St. Johns County, but things may change, especially if we have lots of summer visitors &#8212; I also read your article about all the money allocated to advertising to attract tourists this summer. It seems to me our first priority is taking care to keep current residents healthy and alive. This means social distancing, wearing masks, having testing readily available and taking advantage of it, doing contact tracing &#8212; oh wait. Am I repeating myself? I'm frustrated with the poor attitude on the part of our leaders; I hope you get the message, I wish everyone would get the message.</p>\n\n<p>This really is a matter of life and death, and we need to see action taken by our leaders at all levels of government to help us with this.</p>\n\n<p><person>Kathleen Jordan</person>, <person>St. Augustine</person></p>",
