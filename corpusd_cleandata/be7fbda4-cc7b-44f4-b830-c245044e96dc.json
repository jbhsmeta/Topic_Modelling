Information about the ethnicity of the remaining 336 individuals was\nunavailable.\n\nArkoosh said 520 of the total 596 COVID-19 deaths were county residents who\nlived in long-term care facilities, representing about 87 percent of the total\ndeaths.\n\n#MontcoPa officials reported 15 more deaths from the #coronavirus during the\nlatest three-day period and asked county residents to cooperate with a contact\ntracing program about to get off the ground in order to \"keep our entire\ncommunity safe.\" That update coming shortly\" Carl Hessler Jr.\n(@MontcoCourtNews) May 26, 2020\n\nThe 596 total deaths were \"confirmed positive\" COVID-19 cases through the use\nof lab tests.\n\nOfficials reported that as of Tuesday, 186 other deaths in the county have\nbeen listed as \"probable\" COVID-19 deaths. Those are deaths that list COVID-19\nas a cause of death on a death certificate but in which there was no\nlaboratory confirmation of the virus.\n\nAdditionally, officials reported a total of 115 new positive cases of the\nvirus during the three-day period ending Tuesday, bringing the county's total\nnumber of cases to 6,546 since March 7. The new positive cases included 54\nreported on Sunday, 39 on Monday and 22 on Tuesday.\n\nSixteen of the latest positive individuals were residents of long-term care\nfacilities while 99 were other members of the community. The new positive\ncases included 54 males and 61 females who ranged in age from 1-month to 110.\n\nThe 15 #COVID19 deaths reported Sunday through Tuesday in #Montcopa included\nindividuals who ranged in age from 62 to 101 and the deaths bring the county's\ndeath toll to 596 since March 7, when the first 2 cases of the virus were\nidentified in the county.#CoronavirusUpdate\" Carl Hessler Jr.\n(@MontcoCourtNews) May 26, 2020\n\nOn Friday, Gov. Tom Wolf said the county can move from the \"red phase\" to the\n\"yellow phase\" of his color-coded reopening plan, a phase that will loosen\nsome restrictions, including the stay-at-home order, on June 5.\n\nHowever, Arkoosh pointed out that even in the yellow phase, telework should\ncontinue where feasible and gatherings of more than 25 people will be\nprohibited. Visitor restrictions will remain in place at congregate care\nsettings and at the jail. In-person retail operations are allowable but\ncurbside and delivery, if possible, are recommended.\n\n\"As we move into the yellow phase, our focus will be on keeping the curve\nflat. A key element of living with the virus is contact tracing, which is\ncurrently underway in many parts of the county and will soon be conducted on\nevery case,\" Arkoosh said. \"The goal is to quickly identify and isolate cases\nand contain the spread by quarantining each case's close contacts. That is how\nwe are going to keep the curve flat.\"\n\nUnder the plan, the county will collaborate with four nonprofit organizations\nto manage a staff complement of so-called \"tracers\" who will contact residents\nwho test positive for COVID-19, determine their direct contacts and enter the\ninformation into an alert system that will allow officials to monitor the\npeople who are positive and their contacts.\n\nTo date, 328 females and 268 males have died from #COVID19 in #MontcoPa.\nOfficials added 520 of the total 596 #coronavirus deaths were county residents\nwho lived in long-term care facilities, representing about 87-percent of the\ntotal deaths.\" Carl Hessler Jr. (@MontcoCourtNews) May 26, 2020\n\n\"Persons who test positive with the virus test will receive a call from our\ncontact tracing team to offer guidance and to help persons recall who they had\ncontact with during the time they were infectious,\" Arkoosh explained. \"Staff\nthen will contact and warn those exposed individuals of their potential\nexposure as quickly and as sensitively as possible.\n\n\"The contacts are not given any information about who may have exposed them to\nthe coronavirus. That is kept confidential. All information about the positive\nperson is kept confidential as is the information about anyone who they\nexposed,\" Arkoosh stressed.\n\n\"We are asking that every county resident cooperates with this county effort.\nBy cooperating, this will help keep our entire community safe and keep our\ncommunity open for business. This is what we need to do in our next phase and\nwe really do hope everyone cooperates so that we don't have to take any steps\nbackward,\" Arkoosh added.\n\nMeanwhile, Arkoosh reported the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19\ncontinues to decrease and beds continue to be available at the county's nine\nhospitals.\n\n\"We are now down to approximately 210 individuals being hospitalized for\nCOVID-19 with 23 percent of them on ventilators. This is down from our highest\npoint in which we were in the low 400s. So it's great to see that number cut\nin half and just another sign of good progress here in the county,\" said\nArkoosh, who was joined at the news briefing by fellow commissioners Kenneth\nE. Lawrence Jr. and Joseph C. Gale.\n\n#MontcoPa officials reported a total of 115 new positive cases of #COVID19\nduring 3-day period ending Tues., bringing county's total number of cases to\n6,546.16 of the individuals were residents of long-term care facilities while\n99 were other people in the community\" Carl Hessler Jr. (@MontcoCourtNews) May\n26, 2020\n\nOfficials said they continue to monitor coronavirus data from the 75 long-term\ncare facilities in the county that are licensed by the Pennsylvania Department\nof Health as well as from \"other congregate care settings\" in the county, for\na total of about 620 facilities.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 94 of the facilities reported positive COVID-19 cases among\nresidents and staff.

Officials said the racial breakdown for those that have died included: 13 Asian; three Asian Indian; two Asian Korean; 60 <org>African American</org>; and 182 white. Information about the ethnicity of the remaining 336 individuals was unavailable.</p>\n\n<p>Arkoosh said 520 of the total 596 COVID-19 deaths were county residents who lived in long-term care facilities, representing about 87 percent of the total deaths.</p>\n\n<p>#MontcoPa officials reported 15 more deaths from the #coronavirus during the latest three-day period and asked county residents to cooperate with a contact tracing program about to get off the ground in order to \"keep our entire community safe.\" That update coming shortly\" <person>Carl Hessler Jr</person>. (@MontcoCourtNews) <chron>May 26, 2020</chron></p>\n\n<p>The 596 total deaths were \"confirmed positive\" COVID-19 cases through the use of lab tests.</p>\n\n<p>Officials reported that as of Tuesday, 186 other deaths in the county have been listed as \"probable\" COVID-19 deaths. Those are deaths that list COVID-19 as a cause of death on a death certificate but in which there was no laboratory confirmation of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, officials reported a total of 115 new positive cases of the virus during the three-day period ending Tuesday, bringing the county's total number of cases to 6,546 since <chron>March 7</chron>. The new positive cases included 54 reported on Sunday, 39 on Monday and 22 on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Sixteen of the latest positive individuals were residents of long-term care facilities while 99 were other members of the community.

(@MontcoCourtNews) <chron>May 26, 2020</chron></p>\n\n<p>On Friday, Gov. <person>Tom Wolf</person> said the county can move from the \"red phase\" to the \"yellow phase\" of his color-coded reopening plan, a phase that will loosen some restrictions, including the stay-at-home order, on <chron>June 5</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>However, Arkoosh pointed out that even in the yellow phase, telework should continue where feasible and gatherings of more than 25 people will be prohibited. Visitor restrictions will remain in place at congregate care settings and at the jail. In-person retail operations are allowable but curbside and delivery, if possible, are recommended.</p>\n\n<p>\"As we move into the yellow phase, our focus will be on keeping the curve flat. A key element of living with the virus is contact tracing, which is currently underway in many parts of the county and will soon be conducted on every case,\" Arkoosh said. \"The goal is to quickly identify and isolate cases and contain the spread by quarantining each case's close contacts. That is how we are going to keep the curve flat.\"</p>\n\n<p>Under the plan, the county will collaborate with four nonprofit organizations to manage a staff complement of so-called \"tracers\" who will contact residents who test positive for COVID-19, determine their direct contacts and enter the information into an alert system that will allow officials to monitor the people who are positive and their contacts.</p>\n\n<p>To date, 328 females and 268 males have died from #COVID19 in #MontcoPa.

(@MontcoCourtNews) <chron>May 26, 2020</chron></p>\n\n<p>\"Persons who test positive with the virus test will receive a call from our contact tracing team to offer guidance and to help persons recall who they had contact with during the time they were infectious,\" Arkoosh explained. \"Staff then will contact and warn those exposed individuals of their potential exposure as quickly and as sensitively as possible.</p>\n\n<p>\"The contacts are not given any information about who may have exposed them to the coronavirus. That is kept confidential. All information about the positive person is kept confidential as is the information about anyone who they exposed,\" Arkoosh stressed.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are asking that every county resident cooperates with this county effort. By cooperating, this will help keep our entire community safe and keep our community open for business. This is what we need to do in our next phase and we really do hope everyone cooperates so that we don't have to take any steps backward,\" Arkoosh added.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Arkoosh reported the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 continues to decrease and beds continue to be available at the county's nine hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are now down to approximately 210 individuals being hospitalized for COVID-19 with 23 percent of them on ventilators. This is down from our highest point in which we were in the low 400s. So it's great to see that number cut in half and just another sign of good progress here in the county,\" said Arkoosh, who was joined at the news briefing by fellow commissioners <person>Kenneth E.
