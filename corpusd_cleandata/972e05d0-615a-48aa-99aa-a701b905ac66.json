    "text": "In his 97 years, Marshall Rauch has never lost his Long Island, N.Y., accent,\nbut he's undoubtedly earned his North Carolinian status after moving to Durham\nin 1940 to attend Duke University and spending his life making a huge mark on\nthe state.\n\nSeveral high school friends had told him how much they enjoyed Duke. So he\nheaded south and joined the basketball team as a walk-on and met his future\nwife, Jeanne Girard of Gastonia. World War II interrupted his college\nexperience, as he enlisted in the Air Corps Reserves but was moved to the\nBlack Panther unit of the 66th Infantry Division.\n\nUpon his return, Rauch joined the Girard family's textile business in Bessemer\nCity in Gaston County rather than finish at Duke. He then started Pyramid Milk\non the side, eventually going out on his own. A big break came in 1963 when\nthe then-powerful Spiegel Catalog Co. placed an order for Christmas ornaments\nwound with rayon thread. With an $800 investment in a newly designed metal\ndevice, Rauch produced 300,000 boxes packed with a dozen ornaments each.\n\nFrom that start, Rauch Industries was, for a period, the world's largest\nChristmas ornament producer, quite an irony given the founder's Jewish roots.\nIt went public in 1983 and was acquired by East Boston, Mass.-based Syratech\nfor about $50 million in 1996. Business declined following the acquisition,\nand ownership later changed hands. No ornament manufacturing remains in\nGastonia.\n\nBusiness was a fraction of Rauch's overall impact. He used leadership posts at\nboth the YMCA and city council to boost inclusion of blacks and Jewish people\nin Gastonia affairs. A lifelong Democrat, he also served as a state senator\nfor 24 years. He invested in various ventures, including Edgeway Pharmacy,\nwhich is now run by his grandson, Julian Rauch.\n\nHis best investment may have been in an employment company called One Two\nThree Hire, which was about to collapse when a new owner, Ric Elias, stepped\nup. He offered Rauch $1,000 for his stake, which Rauch declined, then followed\nup two years later with a $3,500 offer. Rauch held on and decided to visit the\ncompany, which transformed into Red Ventures, an Indian Land, S.C.-based\ndigital marketing firm with more than 3,000 workers in 12 offices. CEO Elias\n\"is now one of my best friends,\" says Rauch, though he no longer owns shares\nin the company.\n\nHe talked about war, business and politics in comments edited for length and\nclarity.\n\nI was given the Combat Infantry Badge and the Bronze Star medals. I was in\nFrance, Italy, Germany [during the war]. I was very fortunate. I was wailing\nto get on a ship to go to Japan with hundreds of thousands of guys [toward the\nend of the war]. That's when Harry Truman had the atom bomb dropped, and then\nthe war with Japan was over. I've thought about it many times. It was\nterrible, but I'm alive.\n\nWe docked in New York. I saw my family. My buddies actually picked me up, held\nme. My mother and father, my grandparents, my aunt, my sister and Jeanne were\nall there. I don't think I said two words, and she said, \"We're getting\nmarried in to days.\" I said, \"It suits me.\" We got married down here in\nGastonia.\n\nMy wife's family, they were in a yarn-spinning business. I remember her\nbrother said to me, \"We're so happy you married into the family. You can come\nand have a job here tomorrow, or you can come and have a job here when you\nfinish college. It's up to you.\" And right at that minute, I wasn't going to\nfinish college.\n\nThe funny thing is I made $60 a week. A year and a half later, our first child\nwas born. I was such a good worker that I immediately got a 33% raise to $80\non the occasion of the baby.\n\nI believe I was just about 28 years old. Some of the guys suggested that I\nmight run for city council. All they [had] to do [was] suggest somebody like\nme, and I ran, and 1 got elected. I was the first Jewish person.\n\nI was elected [to the N.C. General Assembly] in 1967, and I served through\n1990, 24 years. I guess I enjoyed that as much or more than anything I've\ndone. And for the first 10 years, I was just a senator, but I made a lot of\nfriends. In that tenth year, Jimmy Green had been a member of the House of\nRepresentatives and house speaker. He wanted to run for lieutenant governor.\nIt just so happened he sat next to me, and we became good friends.\n\nWell, when Jimmy became lieutenant governor, the lieutenant governor appointed\nall the committee chairman. He knighted me. He made me chairman of finance. No\nbill that touches money [or] taxation can be sent to The floor without it\ngoing through the finance committee.\n\nI wanted to build a business. I really held my salary low for years, 10 or 15\nyears, and accumulated money in the company. And then we got a tremendous\nlucky break.\n\nChristmas took us from 40 employees to 1,400. We were the largest Christmas\n[ornament] manufacturer in the world. We had about a million square feet. We\nmoved from Bessemer City to Gastonia.\n\nI took it public to make money. It was a good experience being public. We were\nnot on the New York Stock Exchange. We were NASDAQ and transferred to the\nAmerican Stock Exchange. We weren't the smallest company there, but we weren't\ntremendous. Christmas was a tiny industry in this world.\n\n[Gastonia has] a lot of people here who are on their great-grandfather's farm.\nThey don't want to sell that land. Just to years ago, there was a move to put\n[in] a big thoroughfare. The only way you can get to Charlotte from here is on\n1-85 or Wilkinson Boulevard. Those are parking lots at 5 o'clock at night.\n\nI never believed in cutting money from the government, unless you get it\n[from] somewhere else. Some of these people go in there and they want $5\nmillion for something and just wanted to take it out of the general fund. I\ndon't believe in that.\n\nI think that the elected officials arc more interested in being reelected than\nanything else, and therefore, they are not their own person.",

    "html": "<p>In his 97 years, <person>Marshall Rauch</person> has never lost his <location>Long Island</location>,\nN.Y., accent, but he's undoubtedly earned his North Carolinian\nstatus after moving to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.durham\">Durham</location> in 1940 to attend <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0356235695\">Duke University</org> and\nspending his life making a huge mark on the state.</p>\n\n<p>Several high school friends had told him how much they enjoyed\nDuke. So he headed south and joined the basketball team as a walk-on and\nmet his future wife, <person>Jeanne Girard</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gasnia\">Gastonia</location>. World War II interrupted\nhis college experience, as he enlisted in the Air Corps Reserves but was\nmoved to the Black Panther unit of the <org>66th Infantry Division</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Upon his return, Rauch joined the Girard family's textile\nbusiness in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.besity\">Bessemer City</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gaston\">Gaston County</location> rather than finish at Duke.\nHe then started Pyramid Milk on the side, eventually going out on his\nown. A big break came in 1963 when the then-powerful <org>Spiegel Catalog Co.</org>\nplaced an order for Christmas ornaments wound with rayon thread. With an\n<money>$800</money> investment in a newly designed metal device, Rauch produced 300,000\nboxes packed with a dozen ornaments each.</p>\n\n<p>From that start, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1518833450\">Rauch Industries</org> was, for a period, the\nworld's largest Christmas ornament producer, quite an irony given\nthe founder's Jewish roots. It went public in 1983 and was acquired\nby <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.eaoson\">East Boston, Mass.</location>-based Syratech for about <money>$50 million</money> in 1996.\nBusiness declined following the acquisition, and ownership later changed\nhands. No ornament manufacturing remains in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gasnia\">Gastonia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Business was a fraction of Rauch's overall impact. He used\nleadership posts at both the <org>YMCA</org> and city council to boost inclusion of\nblacks and Jewish people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gasnia\">Gastonia</location> affairs. A lifelong Democrat, he\nalso served as a state senator for 24 years. He invested in various\nventures, including <org>Edgeway Pharmacy</org>, which is now run by his grandson,\n<person>Julian Rauch</person>.</p>\n\n<p>His best investment may have been in an employment company called\nOne Two Three Hire, which was about to collapse when a new owner, <person>Ric\nElias</person>, stepped up. He offered Rauch <money>$1,000</money> for his stake, which Rauch\ndeclined, then followed up two years later with a <money>$3,500</money> offer. Rauch\nheld on and decided to visit the company, which transformed into <org>Red\nVentures</org>, an Indian Land, S.C.-based digital marketing firm with more\nthan 3,000 workers in 12 offices. CEO Elias \"is now one of my best\nfriends,\" says Rauch, though he no longer owns shares in the\ncompany.</p>\n\n<p>He talked about war, business and politics in comments edited for\nlength and clarity.</p>\n\n<p>I was given the Combat Infantry Badge and the Bronze Star medals. I\nwas in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location> [during the war]. I was very fortunate. I\nwas wailing to get on a ship to go to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> with hundreds of thousands\nof guys [toward the end of the war]. That's when <person>Harry Truman</person> had\nthe atom bomb dropped, and then the war with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> was over. I've\nthought about it many times. It was terrible, but I'm alive.</p>\n\n<p>We docked in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>. I saw my family. My buddies actually picked\nme up, held me. My mother and father, my grandparents, my aunt, my\nsister and Jeanne were all there. I don't think I said two words,\nand she said, \"We're getting married in to days.\" I said,\n\"It suits me.\" We got married down here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gasnia\">Gastonia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>My wife's family, they were in a yarn-spinning business. I\nremember her brother said to me, \"We're so happy you married\ninto the family. You can come and have a job here tomorrow, or you can\ncome and have a job here when you finish college. It's up to\nyou.\" And right at that minute, I wasn't going to finish\ncollege.</p>\n\n<p>The funny thing is I made <money>$60</money> a week. A year and a half later, our\nfirst child was born. I was such a good worker that I immediately got a\n33% raise to <money>$80</money> on the occasion of the baby.</p>\n\n<p>I believe I was just about 28 years old. Some of the guys suggested\nthat I might run for city council. All they [had] to do [was] suggest\nsomebody like me, and I ran, and 1 got elected. I was the first Jewish\nperson.</p>\n\n<p>I was elected [to the <org>N.C. General Assembly</org>] in 1967, and I served\nthrough 1990, 24 years. I guess I enjoyed that as much or more than\nanything I've done. And for the first 10 years, I was just a\nsenator, but I made a lot of friends. In that tenth year, <person>Jimmy Green</person>\nhad been a member of the <org>House of Representatives</org> and house speaker. He\nwanted to run for lieutenant governor. It just so happened he sat next\nto me, and we became good friends.</p>\n\n<p>Well, when Jimmy became lieutenant governor, the lieutenant\ngovernor appointed all the committee chairman. He knighted me. He made\nme chairman of finance. No bill that touches money [or] taxation can be\nsent to The floor without it going through the finance committee.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to build a business. I really held my salary low for\nyears, 10 or 15 years, and accumulated money in the company. And then we\ngot a tremendous lucky break.</p>\n\n<p>Christmas took us from 40 employees to 1,400. We were the largest\nChristmas [ornament] manufacturer in the world. We had about a million\nsquare feet. We moved from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.besity\">Bessemer City</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gasnia\">Gastonia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>I took it public to make money. It was a good experience being\npublic. We were not on the <org>New York Stock Exchange</org>. We were NASDAQ and\ntransferred to the <org>American Stock Exchange</org>. We weren't the smallest\ncompany there, but we weren't tremendous. Christmas was a tiny\nindustry in this world.</p>\n\n<p>[<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gasnia\">Gastonia</location> has] a lot of people here who are on their\ngreat-grandfather's farm. They don't want to sell that land.\nJust to years ago, there was a move to put [in] a big thoroughfare. The\nonly way you can get to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.charlt\">Charlotte</location> from here is on 1-85 or <location>Wilkinson\nBoulevard</location>. Those are parking lots at 5 o'clock at night.</p>\n\n<p>I never believed in cutting money from the government, unless you\nget it [from] somewhere else. Some of these people go in there and they\nwant <money>$5 million</money> for something and just wanted to take it out of the\ngeneral fund. I don't believe in that.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the elected officials arc more interested in being\nreelected than anything else, and therefore, they are not their own\nperson.</p>",
