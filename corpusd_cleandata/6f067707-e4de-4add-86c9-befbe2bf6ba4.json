    "text": "A GARDEN inspired by the Yorkshire dales has been named as the best of the\ndecade at the Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nThe Welcome to Yorkshire garden won the highest honour of gold, best\nconstruction award and the people's choice award in 2018.\n\nAnd the garden, created by Yorkshireman Mark Gregory, has now come out on top\nas the BBC RHS people's choice award favourite from the last decade.\n\nThe Wensleydale inspired creation, complete drystone walls, flower-filled\nmeadows, a fast-flowing beck and stone bothy, marked Mr Gregory's 30th\nconsecutive year at the show.\n\nMr Gregory, managing director of Landform Consultants, said: \"What an honour\nit is to be awarded BBC RHS people's choice garden of the decade.\n\n\"I've built and designed gardens at Chelsea every year since 1988, which adds\nup to more than three years of my life! Not being there this year has been\nmore than a little surreal but to win Garden of the Decade means the world.\n\n\"Chelsea is always a team effort and this award is for everyone involved, I'm\nso proud to have been a part of it and I hope this garden and the 2019 Welcome\nto Yorkshire garden will inspire people to visit the home county of which I'm\nso proud.\"\n\nThis year would have been his 100th garden at the show.\n\nTen gardens over ten years were shortlisted for the public to vote for their\nfavourite - including three by.\n\nMr Gregory's 2019 heritage and canal garden was also shortlisted, along with\none by Matthew Wilson in 2016, which was a rural reflection on York Minster's\nEast Window.\n\nJames Mason, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire said: \"It is some\nachievement to win the BBC RHS people's choice award from the last decade for\nthe Yorkshire garden, especially considering the high calibre of competition.\n\n\"Hopefully this will be a reminder of what a picturesque part of Yorkshire\nWensleydale really is. I'm delighted for the Yorkshire Dales National Park\nAuthority, the Wensleydale Creamery and all the businesses in the Yorkshire\nDales who showed great support for the garden and their continued love of such\na spectacular part of the world, which once again deserves to be showcased far\nand wide.\n\n\"Mark Gregory is one of the most talented garden designers in the world and we\nare incredibly fortunate that he just happens to be a Yorkshireman too, who\nhad two gardens in the top ten and the overall winner.\n\n\"I know that the Welcome to Yorkshire team loved showcasing the county at\nChelsea to visitors from across the globe.\n\n\"A worthy win plus a great reminder and inspiration for visitors to explore\nthis picture postcard part of the dales, but for now following Government\nguidelines considering Covid-19.\"\n\nCarl Lis, Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority chairman, said: \"We were\ndelighted to support the stunning Welcome to Yorkshire RHS Chelsea Garden back\nin 2018, and are thrilled that Wensleydale was the inspiration for the BBC RHS\nPeople's Choice Award from the last decade.\n\n\"Huge congratulations to the very talented Mark Gregory, his team, and all at\nWelcome to Yorkshire who contributed so much.\"",

    "html": "<p>A GARDEN inspired by the Yorkshire dales has been named as the best of the decade at the Chelsea Flower Show.</p>\n<p>The Welcome to Yorkshire garden won the highest honour of gold, best construction award and the people&#8217;s choice award in 2018.</p>\n<p>And the garden, created by Yorkshireman <person>Mark Gregory</person>, has now come out on top as the BBC RHS people&#8217;s choice award favourite from the last decade.</p>\n<p>The Wensleydale inspired creation, complete drystone walls, flower-filled meadows, a fast-flowing beck and stone bothy, marked Mr Gregory&#8217;s 30th consecutive year at the show.</p>\n<p><person>Mr Gregory</person>, managing director of <org>Landform Consultants</org>, said: &#8220;What an honour it is to be awarded BBC RHS people&#8217;s choice garden of the decade.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve built and designed gardens at Chelsea every year since 1988, which adds up to more than three years of my life! Not being there this year has been more than a little surreal but to win Garden of the Decade means the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Chelsea is always a team effort and this award is for everyone involved, I&#8217;m so proud to have been a part of it and I hope this garden and the 2019 Welcome to Yorkshire garden will inspire people to visit the home county of which I&#8217;m so proud.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This year would have been his 100th garden at the show.</p>\n<p>Ten gardens over ten years were shortlisted for the public to vote for their favourite &#8211; including three by.</p>\n<p>Mr Gregory&#8217;s 2019 heritage and canal garden was also shortlisted, along with one by <person>Matthew Wilson</person> in 2016, which was a rural reflection on York Minster&#8217;s East Window.</p>\n<p><person>James Mason</person>, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire said: &#8220;It is some achievement to win the BBC RHS people&#8217;s choice award from the last decade for the Yorkshire garden, especially considering the high calibre of competition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hopefully this will be a reminder of what a picturesque part of Yorkshire Wensleydale really is. I&#8217;m delighted for the <org>Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority</org>, the <org>Wensleydale Creamery</org> and all the businesses in the Yorkshire Dales who showed great support for the garden and their continued love of such a spectacular part of the world, which once again deserves to be showcased far and wide.</p>\n<p>\"<person>Mark Gregory</person> is one of the most talented garden designers in the world and we are incredibly fortunate that he just happens to be a Yorkshireman too, who had two gardens in the top ten and the overall winner.</p>\n<p>\"I know that the Welcome to Yorkshire team loved showcasing the county at Chelsea to visitors from across the globe.</p>\n<p>\"A worthy win plus a great reminder and inspiration for visitors to explore this picture postcard part of the dales, but for now following Government guidelines considering Covid-19.\"</p>\n<p><person>Carl Lis</person>, <org>Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority</org> chairman, said: \"We were delighted to support the stunning Welcome to Yorkshire RHS Chelsea Garden back in 2018, and are thrilled that Wensleydale was the inspiration for the BBC RHS People&#8217;s Choice Award from the last decade.</p>\n<p>\"Huge congratulations to the very talented <person>Mark Gregory</person>, his team, and all at Welcome to Yorkshire who contributed so much.\"</p>",
