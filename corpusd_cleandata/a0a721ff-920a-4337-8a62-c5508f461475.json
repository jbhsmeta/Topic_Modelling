    "text": "Are we, or are we not, at war with a hidden enemy (the Wuhan virus)? If we are\nnot, the Quisling politicians, newspaper outlets, alphabet TV stations, et\nal., are correct.\n\nIf we are, then the Quislings are cheerleaders for anything anti-American and\ninadvertently collude with foreign entities such as the Chinese Communist\ngovernment, Russia and all other regimes wishing for our democratic way of\nlife to fail.\n\nTo be objective and watch a variety of news broadcasts is disheartening. The\nnegativity on the part of propagandizing false truths at the U.S. government\nand the president during wartime is tantamount to the destruction of our\ndemocratic way of life. Criticism with substantive facts (not regurgitation of\nso-called news personalities, et al.) should be acceptable with doubt.\n\nWhere has this negativity originated?\n\nIn a war when people use derogatory terms and regurgitate someone else's\nthoughts other than theirs, it becomes biased, and a skewed view that our\nadversaries are masters at. When an undermining of a democratic process of\nfacts without due process of rights, it corrupts and destroys.\n\n\"No one is above the law,\" it's said, but in my opinion it should have\ncontinued \"unless you are  .\"\n\nSeveral attempts have been directed against American citizens by politicized\nagencies such as IRS, FBI, CIA, NSA; the Justice Department and the FISA\ncourt; and congressional committees. This is frightening. The expenditure of\nmillions upon millions of of taxpayer dollars by these parties (no one has\naccounted for each probe) with the express idea of \"Gotcha!\" has made lawyers\nwealthy, taxpayers poorer and our enemies emboldened because they successfully\nsowed the seeds of destruction of our country from within.\n\nRemember, if this is a war, the outcome is either winning or losing.\n\nEd Winslow, Port St. Lucie\n\nOne of the more surprising responses to the global COVID-19 pandemic has been\nRep. Brian Mast's display (online column, May 7) of a deep-seated disdain for\nthe men and women of Florida agriculture.\n\nInstead of meeting their dedication to sustainably growing and harvesting food\nin the middle of a food shortage with appreciation, he has doubled down by\nattacking them through the media and even threatening to take their water.\n\nWhat did farmers south of Lake Okeechobee do to so anger Rep. Mast? Was it\ntheir decades of perfecting the growth of food crops people want and need.\nalong with cleaner water? Or their commitment to growing a diversity of food\nincluding fresh fruit such as bananas and mangos, vegetables such as lettuce,\ngreen beans and sweet corn as well as organic rice?\n\nBecause when he attacks \"Big Sugar,\" he also attacks all the farmers that grow\nsugarcane along with these crops that are grown in rotation with cane.\n\nFortunately, our local farmers didn't close when government shut down non-\nessential businesses. That is why Mast's anti-farming rhetoric is so\nsurprising. He should do better, for everyone's sake.\n\nLisa Walker, Clewiston\n\nIn recognition of Foster Parent Appreciation Month, I want to thank our local\ncaregivers who - even during a pandemic - welcome hurting children into their\nlives. The children we place into their homes are among the most vulnerable\ncitizens in our community. They are the abused, the neglected; some of them\nhave been abandoned - all by people they trusted.\n\nCOVID-19 and the possibility that foster parents might shut their homes in\nfear of contagion made these children all the more vulnerable. But our\ncaregivers did not shut their doors.\n\nEvery year, every day, foster parents take sick children without hesitation.\nThey take them with the flu, with coughs and colds. They take them with mental\nand behavioral issues that pose health risks of their own. Foster parents open\ntheir homes to these children because something calls them to do so. They hear\nthe call to act and run headfirst into the unknown. The pandemic changed none\nof this.\n\nThe caregiver call to action has never been more important. Calls to the\nstate's abuse registry have decreased significantly during the shutdown -\nsomething we expected when schools closed and teachers could no longer see\ntheir students every day. We know that isolation and stress lead to abuse, and\nso we are preparing for more children to enter care once the pandemic has\nended and our community is fully reopened.\n\nOur existing foster parents are doing the best they can during this trying\ntime, but children continue to come into care and need homes. If you have\nthought about being a foster parent but concerns about COVID-19 have kept you\nfrom moving forward, we ask you to reconsider. We are sending out the call; we\nare asking for your help.\n\nCarol Deloach, Port St. Lucie\n\nCarol Deloach is the chief executive officer of Communities Connected for Kids\nin Port St. Lucie.\n\nWith the county getting back to normal, I am sure county and local budgets\nwill be needy. EMS and others really had a lot of overtime, no doubt way above\nwhat was budgeted.\n\nA quick look at where we can save money seems to be dumping sand in the ocean.\nThe county has spent hundreds of thousands on sand. Let's think smart about\nthis.\n\nThere is construction going on around the county. Mapp Road and Southeast\nCommerce Avenue both have construction projects going on. Why not take all\nthat old concrete they are digging up for an artificial reef?\n\nThe county should set aside an easy-to-reach lot of land for citizens to bring\nconcrete pieces. Once you get a big pile of concrete pieces, put them on a\nbarge and just a little offshore, dump the pieces in a line. In no time nature\nwill use this and coral will grow and lobsters will live in the broken pipes.\n\nBest of all it will protect our beaches, for many years to come, and save\nmoney in the process.\n\nJohn Spatuzzi, Palm City\n\nRecently our country has witnessed a rupture between those who feel that their\nindividual freedom is being violated by local or state orders to stay at home\nand close businesses, and those who feel that these restrictions, no matter\nhow personally onerous they may be, are necessary for the common good and\nsafety.\n\nThus we read of armed vigilantes carrying AR-15 semiautomatic rifles\nsurrounding a tattoo parlor in Odessa, Texas, to protect an owner who is\ndefying state orders. We all have seen similarly armed vigilantes storming the\nstate capitol in Lansing, Michigan, to try to intimidate the state governor to\nmake her comply with their interpretation of their constitutional right to go\nanywhere they want whenever they want.\n\nThey are mistaken about their constitutional rights, particularly in an\nemergency like this pandemic. Nor do they have the right to arm themselves to\ndeliberately intimidate their fellow citizens or their duly-elected officials\ntrying to protect the general public. These are the acts of thugs who\nrepresent a minority view but think they can threaten their fellow citizens\nwith guns to get their way.\n\nIn a recent letter I read, \"Closing beaches here in Florida is like outlawing\nprayer in church. Not acceptable under any circumstances.\" Here we have the\nsame total misunderstanding of our individual rights (plus a horrible\nanalogy!). As a retired history teacher, I get depressed reading these\ncomments, about these vigilante actions and wonder what we teachers have\nfailed to do to educate our citizens.\n\nThe three examples I mention all indicate a serious problem many Americans\nhave in putting their personal desires over the common good, wishful thinking\nover science, and opinion over facts. It's time to grow up!\n\nAndrew Sorbo, Sebastian\n\nNow that Gov. Ron DeSantis has lifted the prohibition on elective medical\nprocedures in Florida, it is important for individuals who have been putting\noff important tests and treatments to see their physicians for the care they\nneed.\n\nWhile the prohibition was necessary to ensure Florida's healthcare system was\ncapable of handling the COVID-19 crisis, an unintended consequence was that\nmany people with conditions ranging from abdominal pain to trauma stayed home\ninstead of getting the early treatment that could minimize damage and improve\npatient outcomes.\n\nTo prevent a second healthcare crisis, people need to know that physician\npractices have reopened in every part of the state with protocols in place to\nensure that patients are cared for safely.\n\nThe Florida Medical Association, along with the American Medical Association\nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have provided guidelines\nand checklists for physician practices to follow to ensure that patients are\nprotected to the greatest extent possible. Requiring patients to wear face\ncoverings, limiting non-patient visitors, and screening patients before in-\nperson visits are among the new protocols that have been put into place.\nTesting of physicians and medical staff members has increased and enhanced\nsanitization procedures have been implemented.\n\nPhysician practices are taking these extra precautions to encourage their\npatients to continue obtaining in-person care when medical attention is needed\n- especially those with preexisting conditions that require follow-up care\nwith a healthcare provider.\n\nPatients who have chronic medical problems need to have regular check-ups to\nmake sure they are doing well. Postponing care because of the COVID-19 crisis\nputs patients at high risk for complications later and eventually could cause\na treatable condition to become untreatable.\n\nThe resulting complications could end up being worse than the (COVID-19)\ndisease.\n\nRonald Giffler, Tallahassee\n\nRonald Giffler, M.D., J.D., M.B.A., is President of the Florida Medical\nAssociation\n\nWhy do delivery people no longer knock when leaving a package at our\nresidences?\n\nIn the past they always knocked to alert us that we had a delivery. A good\nsystem, I think. In the last few months we had numerous things delivered and\nthe driver did not knock. This includes UPS, Amazon and Walmart, among others.\n\nI asked one driver why he didn't knock and he said it was because he had taken\na photo to show that the item arrived at the proper destination. I explained\nthat this in no way protected me from having the item stolen.\n\nSome companies send constant updates as to where your shipment is and when it\nis delivered at your door. That is all well and good, but is not a reason to\nnot knock on the door of the home when the package is dropped off. I don't sit\nat my computer all day. Nor am I constantly using a smart phone.\n\nOn YouTube you can see a lot of videos of thieves stealing packages from door-\nsteps and porches. They are known as \"Porch Pirates.\" The delivery companies\nknow this is happening. In a couple videos you can see the driver lay the\npackage down, take a photo, and then pick up the item and walk away with it.\n\nCome on, delivery companies, you should and can do better. In the past, I\nadmired drivers because they were so thoughtful. Last week a driver left a\npackage, containing medication, in the sun when two feet away shade was\navailable all day. No, he didn't knock.\n\nJerry Brewer, Fort Pierce",

    "html": "<p>Are we, or are we not, at war with a hidden enemy (the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..wuhan\">Wuhan</location> virus)? If we are not, the Quisling politicians, newspaper outlets, alphabet TV stations, et al., are correct.</p>\n<p>If we are, then the Quislings are cheerleaders for anything anti-American and inadvertently collude with foreign entities such as the Chinese Communist government, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> and all other regimes wishing for our democratic way of life to fail.</p>\n\n<p>To be objective and watch a variety of news broadcasts is disheartening. The negativity on the part of propagandizing false truths at the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> government and the president during wartime is tantamount to the destruction of our democratic way of life. Criticism with substantive facts (not regurgitation of so-called news personalities, et al.) should be acceptable with doubt.</p>\n\n<p>Where has this negativity originated?</p>\n\n<p>In a war when people use derogatory terms and regurgitate someone else's thoughts other than theirs, it becomes biased, and a skewed view that our adversaries are masters at. When an undermining of a democratic process of facts without due process of rights, it corrupts and destroys.</p>\n\n<p>\"No one is above the law,\" it's said, but in my opinion it should have continued \"unless you are &#133; .\"</p>\n\n<p>Several attempts have been directed against American citizens by politicized agencies such as <org>IRS</org>, FBI, CIA, <org>NSA</org>; the <org>Justice Department</org> and the FISA court; and congressional committees. This is frightening. The expenditure of millions upon millions of of taxpayer dollars by these parties (no one has accounted for each probe) with the express idea of \"Gotcha!\" has made lawyers wealthy, taxpayers poorer and our enemies emboldened because they successfully sowed the seeds of destruction of our country from within.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, if this is a war, the outcome is either winning or losing.</p>\n\n<p><person>Ed Winslow</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.porcie\">Port St. Lucie</location></p>\n\n<p>One of the more surprising responses to the global COVID-19 pandemic has been Rep. <person>Brian Mast's</person> display (online column, <chron>May 7</chron>) of a deep-seated disdain for the men and women of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of meeting their dedication to sustainably growing and harvesting food in the middle of a food shortage with appreciation, he has doubled down by attacking them through the media and even threatening to take their water.</p>\n\n<p>What did farmers south of <location>Lake Okeechobee</location> do to so anger <person>Rep. Mast</person>? Was it their decades of perfecting the growth of food crops people want and need. along with cleaner water? Or their commitment to growing a diversity of food including fresh fruit such as bananas and mangos, vegetables such as lettuce, green beans and sweet corn as well as organic rice?</p>\n\n<p>Because when he attacks \"Big Sugar,\" he also attacks all the farmers that grow sugarcane along with these crops that are grown in rotation with cane.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, our local farmers didn't close when government shut down non-essential businesses. That is why Mast's anti-farming rhetoric is so surprising. He should do better, for everyone's sake.</p>\n\n<p><person>Lisa Walker</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.cleton\">Clewiston</location></p>\n\n<p>In recognition of Foster Parent Appreciation Month, I want to thank our local caregivers who - even during a pandemic - welcome hurting children into their lives. The children we place into their homes are among the most vulnerable citizens in our community. They are the abused, the neglected; some of them have been abandoned - all by people they trusted.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 and the possibility that foster parents might shut their homes in fear of contagion made these children all the more vulnerable. But our caregivers did not shut their doors.</p>\n\n<p>Every year, every day, foster parents take sick children without hesitation. They take them with the flu, with coughs and colds. They take them with mental and behavioral issues that pose health risks of their own. Foster parents open their homes to these children because something calls them to do so. They hear the call to act and run headfirst into the unknown. The pandemic changed none of this.</p>\n\n<p>The caregiver call to action has never been more important. Calls to the state's abuse registry have decreased significantly during the shutdown - something we expected when schools closed and teachers could no longer see their students every day. We know that isolation and stress lead to abuse, and so we are preparing for more children to enter care once the pandemic has ended and our community is fully reopened.</p>\n\n<p>Our existing foster parents are doing the best they can during this trying time, but children continue to come into care and need homes. If you have thought about being a foster parent but concerns about COVID-19 have kept you from moving forward, we ask you to reconsider. We are sending out the call; we are asking for your help.</p>\n\n<p><person>Carol Deloach</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.porcie\">Port St. Lucie</location></p>\n\n<p><person>Carol Deloach</person> is the chief executive officer of Communities Connected for Kids in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.porcie\">Port St. Lucie</location>.</p>\n\n<p>With the county getting back to normal, I am sure county and local budgets will be needy. EMS and others really had a lot of overtime, no doubt way above what was budgeted.</p>\n\n<p>A quick look at where we can save money seems to be dumping sand in the ocean. The county has spent hundreds of thousands on sand. Let's think smart about this.</p>\n\n<p>There is construction going on around the county. <location>Mapp Road</location> and <location>Southeast Commerce Avenue</location> both have construction projects going on. Why not take all that old concrete they are digging up for an artificial reef?</p>\n\n<p>The county should set aside an easy-to-reach lot of land for citizens to bring concrete pieces. Once you get a big pile of concrete pieces, put them on a barge and just a little offshore, dump the pieces in a line. In no time nature will use this and coral will grow and lobsters will live in the broken pipes.</p>\n\n<p>Best of all it will protect our beaches, for many years to come, and save money in the process.</p>\n\n<p><person>John Spatuzzi</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.pality\">Palm City</location></p>\n\n<p>Recently our country has witnessed a rupture between those who feel that their individual freedom is being violated by local or state orders to stay at home and close businesses, and those who feel that these restrictions, no matter how personally onerous they may be, are necessary for the common good and safety.</p>\n\n<p>Thus we read of armed vigilantes carrying AR-15 semiautomatic rifles surrounding a tattoo parlor in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.odessa\">Odessa, Texas</location>, to protect an owner who is defying state orders. We all have seen similarly armed vigilantes storming the state capitol in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.lansin\">Lansing, Michigan</location>, to try to intimidate the state governor to make her comply with their interpretation of their constitutional right to go anywhere they want whenever they want.</p>\n\n<p>They are mistaken about their constitutional rights, particularly in an emergency like this pandemic. Nor do they have the right to arm themselves to deliberately intimidate their fellow citizens or their duly-elected officials trying to protect the general public. These are the acts of thugs who represent a minority view but think they can threaten their fellow citizens with guns to get their way.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent letter I read, \"Closing beaches here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> is like outlawing prayer in church. Not acceptable under any circumstances.\" Here we have the same total misunderstanding of our individual rights (plus a horrible analogy!). As a retired history teacher, I get depressed reading these comments, about these vigilante actions and wonder what we teachers have failed to do to educate our citizens.</p>\n\n<p>The three examples I mention all indicate a serious problem many Americans have in putting their personal desires over the common good, wishful thinking over science, and opinion over facts. It's time to grow up!</p>\n\n<p><person>Andrew Sorbo</person>, Sebastian</p>\n\n<p>Now that Gov. <person>Ron DeSantis</person> has lifted the prohibition on elective medical procedures in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, it is important for individuals who have been putting off important tests and treatments to see their physicians for the care they need.</p>\n\n<p>While the prohibition was necessary to ensure <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> healthcare system was capable of handling the COVID-19 crisis, an unintended consequence was that many people with conditions ranging from abdominal pain to trauma stayed home instead of getting the early treatment that could minimize damage and improve patient outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent a second healthcare crisis, people need to know that physician practices have reopened in every part of the state with protocols in place to ensure that patients are cared for safely.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Florida Medical Association</org>, along with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3014283382\">American Medical Association</org> and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</org>, have provided guidelines and checklists for physician practices to follow to ensure that patients are protected to the greatest extent possible. Requiring patients to wear face coverings, limiting non-patient visitors, and screening patients before in-person visits are among the new protocols that have been put into place. Testing of physicians and medical staff members has increased and enhanced sanitization procedures have been implemented.</p>\n\n<p>Physician practices are taking these extra precautions to encourage their patients to continue obtaining in-person care when medical attention is needed - especially those with preexisting conditions that require follow-up care with a healthcare provider.</p>\n\n<p>Patients who have chronic medical problems need to have regular check-ups to make sure they are doing well. Postponing care because of the COVID-19 crisis puts patients at high risk for complications later and eventually could cause a treatable condition to become untreatable.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting complications could end up being worse than the (COVID-19) disease.</p>\n\n<p><person>Ronald Giffler</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.talsee\">Tallahassee</location></p>\n\n<p><person>Ronald Giffler</person>, M.D., J.D., M.B.A., is President of the <org>Florida Medical Association</org></p>\n\n<p>Why do delivery people no longer knock when leaving a package at our residences?</p>\n\n<p>In the past they always knocked to alert us that we had a delivery. A good system, I think. In the last few months we had numerous things delivered and the driver did not knock. This includes <org>UPS</org>, Amazon and Walmart, among others.</p>\n\n<p>I asked one driver why he didn't knock and he said it was because he had taken a photo to show that the item arrived at the proper destination. I explained that this in no way protected me from having the item stolen.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies send constant updates as to where your shipment is and when it is delivered at your door. That is all well and good, but is not a reason to not knock on the door of the home when the package is dropped off. I don't sit at my computer all day. Nor am I constantly using a smart phone.</p>\n\n<p>On YouTube you can see a lot of videos of thieves stealing packages from door-steps and porches. They are known as \"Porch Pirates.\" The delivery companies know this is happening. In a couple videos you can see the driver lay the package down, take a photo, and then pick up the item and walk away with it.</p>\n\n<p>Come on, delivery companies, you should and can do better. In the past, I admired drivers because they were so thoughtful. Last week a driver left a package, containing medication, in the sun when two feet away shade was available all day. No, he didn't knock.</p>\n\n<p><person>Jerry Brewer</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.forrce\">Fort Pierce</location></p>",
