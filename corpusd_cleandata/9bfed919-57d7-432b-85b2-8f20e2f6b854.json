    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at CDC & FDA\nDaily \\-- Research findings on Coronavirus - COVID-19 are discussed in a new\nreport. According to news reporting from Bucharest, Romania, by NewsRx\njournalists, research stated, \"Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense\nRNA viruses, are a group of viruses that cause infections in the human\nrespiratory tract, which can be characterized clinically from mild to fatal.\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus\nresponsible.\"\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the 'Carol\nDavila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, \"The global spread of COVID-19\ncan be described as the worst pandemic in humanity in the last century. To\ndate, COVID-19 has infected more than 3,000,000 people worldwide and killed\nmore than 200,000 people. All age groups can be infected from the virus, but\nmore serious symptoms that can possibly result in death are observed in older\npeople and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular and\npulmonary disease. Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative\nprognosis for the obese patients. A growing body of evidence connects obesity\nwith COVID-19 and a number of mechanisms from immune system activity\nattenuation to chronic inflammation are implicated. Lipid peroxidation creates\nreactive lipid aldehydes which in a patient with metabolic disorder and\nCOVID-19 will affect its prognosis.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Finally, pregnancy-\nassociated obesity needs to be studied further in connection to COVID-19 as\nthis infection could pose high risk both to pregnant women and the fetus.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Obesity - a risk factor for\nincreased COVID-19 prevalence, severity and lethality (Review). _Molecular\nMedicine Reports_ , 2020;22(1):9-19.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting D. Margina, 'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy,\nFaculty of Pharmacy, Dept. of Biochemistry, 020956 Bucharest, Romania.\nAdditional authors for this research include D. Petrakis, K. Tsarouhas, F.\nTekos, M. Stan, D. Nikitovic, D. Kouretas, D.A. Spandidos and A. Tsatsakis.\n\nThe direct object identifier (DOI) for that additional information is:\n<https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2020.11127>.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>CDC &amp; FDA Daily</org> -- Research findings on Coronavirus - COVID-19 are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ro..bucrst\">Bucharest, Romania</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, are a group of viruses that cause infections in the human respiratory tract, which can be characterized clinically from mild to fatal. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the &#8216;Carol Davila&#8217; <org>University of Medicine</org> and Pharmacy, &#8220;The global spread of COVID-19 can be described as the worst pandemic in humanity in the last century. To date, COVID-19 has infected more than 3,000,000 people worldwide and killed more than 200,000 people. All age groups can be infected from the virus, but more serious symptoms that can possibly result in death are observed in older people and those with underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Novel data report more severe symptoms and even a negative prognosis for the obese patients. A growing body of evidence connects obesity with COVID-19 and a number of mechanisms from immune system activity attenuation to chronic inflammation are implicated. Lipid peroxidation creates reactive lipid aldehydes which in a patient with metabolic disorder and COVID-19 will affect its prognosis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;Finally, pregnancy-associated obesity needs to be studied further in connection to COVID-19 as this infection could pose high risk both to pregnant women and the fetus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Obesity - a risk factor for increased COVID-19 prevalence, severity and lethality (Review). <em>Molecular Medicine Reports</em>, 2020;22(1):9-19.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>D.
