    "text": "Study: Nurses may have poorest perceptions of workplace safety climate\nCompared to other groups of healthcare practitioners, nurses may have the\npoorest perceptions of workplace safety climate and the highest rates of\ninjuries and sick time, suggests a single-hospital study in the May/June issue\nof the Journal of Healthcare Management. It is an official publication of the\nAmerican College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE). The journal is published in\nthe Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer. Low ratings of workplace safety\nmay also be associated with increased job stress and decreased job\nsatisfaction for nurses, healthcare aides, and allied healthcare\nprofessionals, according to the new research by Gwen E. McGhan, PhD, and\ncolleagues of University of Calgary. They write, \"Considering the importance\nof safety climate perceptions for the well-being of care practitioners,\nhealthcare organizations need to prioritize workplace safety to optimize\npractitioners' perceptions.\" The survey study included three groups of\nhealthcare professionals at one Canadian hospital: nurses, healthcare aides,\nand allied health professionals (for example, physical and occupational\ntherapists). All groups completed a 10-item individual workplace safety\nclimate scale, rating their agreement/disagreement with job descriptions such\nas \"unsafe,\" \"risky,\" or \"could get hurt.\" Perceptions of workplace safety\nclimate were compared among groups, and associations with ratings of job\nstress, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions were assessed. The analysis\nincluded 144 responses (survey response rate 28 percent) from three hospital\nunits where all three groups of professionals worked. Nurses had the lowest\nratings of workplace safety climate, followed closely by healthcare aides. In\ncontrast, allied health professionals had significantly higher safety\nperceptions. \"Nurses reported the poorest safety perceptions, lowest job\nsatisfaction, and highest stress, while allied health professionals reported\nthe highest safety perceptions and job satisfaction and the lowest stress,\"\nDr. McGhan and coauthors write. Turnover intentions (for example, \"How often\ndo you consider leaving your job?\") were also highest for nurses and lowest\nfor allied health professionals. Workplace safety climate perceptions were\nalso related to reported injuries and illnesses: 68.3 percent of all injuries\noccurred in nurses, compared to 23.3 percent for healthcare aides and 8.3\npercent for allied health professionals. As individual safety perceptions\ndecreased, the odds of being injured at work more than doubled. The higher\ninjury rates in nurses and aides might reflect their greater involvement in\ndirect, hands-on patient care, the researchers suggest. Nurses accounted for\n53.2 percent of all paid sick time, healthcare aides for 42.2 percent, and\nallied health professionals for 4.6 percent. \"Healthcare organizations are\nstruggling to cope with a growing global shortage of healthcare\npractitioners,\" according to the authors. Along with growing caseloads and\nother factors, rates of injuries and illness in healthcare professionals -\namong the highest of any occupational group - may affect the ability to retain\nqualified practitioners. The new findings suggest that different groups of\nhealthcare practitioners have differing perceptions of workplace safety\nclimate, and that these perceptions affect job stress, job satisfaction, and\ninjury/illness rates.

    "title": "Study: Nurses may have poorest perceptions of workplace safety climate [News-Medical.Net]",
    "html": "<p>Study: Nurses may have poorest perceptions of workplace safety climate Compared to other groups of healthcare practitioners, nurses may have the poorest perceptions of workplace safety climate and the highest rates of injuries and sick time, suggests a single-hospital study in the May/June issue of the <org>Journal of Healthcare Management</org>.  It is an official publication of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3722121324\">American College of Healthcare Executives</org> (ACHE). The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by <person>Wolters Kluwer</person>. Low ratings of workplace safety may also be associated with increased job stress and decreased job satisfaction for nurses, healthcare aides, and allied healthcare professionals, according to the new research by <person>Gwen E. McGhan</person>, PhD, and colleagues of <org>University of Calgary</org>. They write, \"Considering the importance of safety climate perceptions for the well-being of care practitioners, healthcare organizations need to prioritize workplace safety to optimize practitioners' perceptions.\" The survey study included three groups of healthcare professionals at one Canadian hospital: nurses, healthcare aides, and allied health professionals (for example, physical and occupational therapists). All groups completed a 10-item individual workplace safety climate scale, rating their agreement/disagreement with job descriptions such as \"unsafe,\" \"risky,\" or \"could get hurt.\" Perceptions of workplace safety climate were compared among groups, and associations with ratings of job stress, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions were assessed. The analysis included 144 responses (survey response rate 28 percent) from three hospital units where all three groups of professionals worked. Nurses had the lowest ratings of workplace safety climate, followed closely by healthcare aides. In contrast, allied health professionals had significantly higher safety perceptions. \"Nurses reported the poorest safety perceptions, lowest job satisfaction, and highest stress, while allied health professionals reported the highest safety perceptions and job satisfaction and the lowest stress,\" <person>Dr. McGhan</person> and coauthors write. Turnover intentions (for example, \"How often do you consider leaving your job?\") were also highest for nurses and lowest for allied health professionals. Workplace safety climate perceptions were also related to reported injuries and illnesses: 68.3 percent of all injuries occurred in nurses, compared to 23.3 percent for healthcare aides and 8.3 percent for allied health professionals. As individual safety perceptions decreased, the odds of being injured at work more than doubled. The higher injury rates in nurses and aides might reflect their greater involvement in direct, hands-on patient care, the researchers suggest. Nurses accounted for 53.2 percent of all paid sick time, healthcare aides for 42.2 percent, and allied health professionals for 4.6 percent. \"Healthcare organizations are struggling to cope with a growing global shortage of healthcare practitioners,\" according to the authors. Along with growing caseloads and other factors, rates of injuries and illness in healthcare professionals - among the highest of any occupational group - may affect the ability to retain qualified practitioners. The new findings suggest that different groups of healthcare practitioners have differing perceptions of workplace safety climate, and that these perceptions affect job stress, job satisfaction, and injury/illness rates. <person>Dr. McGhan</person> and coauthors conclude:  Wolters Kluwer Health  McGhan, Gwen E., et al .
