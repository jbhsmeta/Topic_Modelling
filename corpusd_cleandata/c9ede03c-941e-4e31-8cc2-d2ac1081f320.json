    "text": "clubs have headed off a row over what happens if the 2019-20 season is\ncurtailed by agreeing to wait to see whether the Championship finishes its\ncampaign.The move would be strongly opposed by the English Football League and\nthe Football Association, who have insisted that relegation and promotion is\nfundamental to their agreement.Deciding the mechanism for so-called\ncurtailment was one of the outstanding issues discussed at the meeting of the\n20 clubs, with the expectation that it would be voted on next week.However, it\nwas decided that curtailment, and what happens, should be dealt with only if\nit actually takes place.It means the season will resume on June 17 without any\nagreement on how final places would be decided should it be abandoned, which\nruns contrary to the return-to-competition guidelines suggested by the UK's\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and .The biggest complication would be\nif the was completed but the Championship was not.Some top-flight clubs are\nadamant that it would be unfair to impose relegation. They argue that they\nwould be penalised for playing on while the division below did not complete\nits fixtures.The likeliest mechanism to decide placings, which most clubs\naccept, is points-per-game, which is also favoured by the EFL whose 71 clubs\nwill vote on how they want to finish their campaigns on Tuesday.In the end,\nthe full debate over curtailment in the did not take place, with the\nintervention of one club chairman proving decisive as he headed off an\napparent row. A number of other issues were resolved before the top flight's\nconfirmed return on June 17. These included:A dismissal of the proposals to\nallow broadcasters such as Sky s greater access during matches including half-\ntime player interviews and cameras in the dressing rooms. This is partly\nfuelled by the anger many clubs feel over the rebate that is due to the\nbroadcasters even though they are being allowed to show all the games\nlive.Meanwhile, managers have been told to limit pre-match meetings to 15\nminutes when the season restarts, while, as expected, players will be allowed\ninto the dressing rooms in shifts.Protocols around the changing areas have\nbeen one of the biggest issues for match preparations for Project Restart,\nalong with travelling to fixtures as squads will be advised to travel on the\nday of games.This issue, and the number of people allowed inside a stadium,\nwill be discussed at next Thursday's shareholders meeting and although the is\nconcerned there will be a disagreement on their proposals, most clubs accept\nit is too close to the restart of the campaign for it to be a problem.Teams\nare set to use different parts of the stadium - including corporate boxes -\nfor players to get changed before playing. And getting the entire squad\ntogether for final instructions from the manager will be monitored to ensure\nthe potential spread of coronavirus is minimal.

    "html": "<p>clubs have headed off a row over what happens if the 2019-20 season is curtailed by agreeing to wait to see whether the Championship finishes its campaign.The move would be strongly opposed by the <org>English Football League</org> and the <org>Football Association</org>, who have insisted that relegation and promotion is fundamental to their agreement.Deciding the mechanism for so-called curtailment was one of the outstanding issues discussed at the meeting of the 20  clubs, with the expectation that it would be voted on next week.However, it was decided that curtailment, and what happens, should be dealt with only if it actually takes place.It means the season will resume on <chron>June 17</chron> without any agreement on how final places would be decided should it be abandoned, which runs contrary to the return-to-competition guidelines suggested by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK's</location> <org>Department for Digital</org>, Culture, Media and .The biggest complication would be if the  was completed but the Championship was not.Some top-flight clubs are adamant that it would be unfair to impose relegation. They argue that they would be penalised for playing on while the division below did not complete its fixtures.The likeliest mechanism to decide placings, which most clubs accept, is points-per-game, which is also favoured by the EFL whose 71 clubs will vote on how they want to finish their campaigns on Tuesday.In the end, the full debate over curtailment in the  did not take place, with the intervention of one club chairman proving decisive as he headed off an apparent row. A number of other issues were resolved before the top flight's confirmed return on <chron>June 17</chron>. These included:A dismissal of the proposals to allow broadcasters such as Sky s greater access during matches including half-time player interviews and cameras in the dressing rooms. This is partly fuelled by the anger many clubs feel over the rebate that is due to the broadcasters even though they are being allowed to show all the games live.Meanwhile,  managers have been told to limit pre-match meetings to 15 minutes when the season restarts, while, as expected, players will be allowed into the dressing rooms in shifts.Protocols around the changing areas have been one of the biggest issues for match preparations for Project Restart, along with travelling to fixtures as squads will be advised to travel on the day of games.This issue, and the number of people allowed inside a stadium, will be discussed at next Thursday's shareholders meeting and although the  is concerned there will be a disagreement on their proposals, most clubs accept it is too close to the restart of the campaign for it to be a problem.Teams are set to use different parts of the stadium - including corporate boxes - for players to get changed before playing. And getting the entire squad together for final instructions from the manager will be monitored to ensure the potential spread of coronavirus is minimal.
