    "text": "Washington, DC: Democratic National Committee has issued the following press\nrelease:\n\nFollowing Trump's outrageous abuse of the military to threaten peaceful\nprotesters, former military leaders have continued their unprecedented public\ncriticism of Trump, adding to comments by multiple military leaders last week.\n\nColin Powell, the first African American secretary of state and chairman of\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Trump has \"drifted away\" from the\nConstitution, and he endorsed Joe Biden for president.\n\nPOWELL: \"We have a Constitution. And we have to follow that Constitution. And\nthe President has drifted away from it.\"\n\nPOWELL: \"I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year. ...\nI will be voting for [Joe Biden].\"\n\nTrump's former chief of staff, retired four-star General John Kelly, said he\nwould have \"argued against\" Trump forcefully clearing out peaceful protesters\nfor a photo-op.\n\nKELLY: \"The idea that you would unleash American active duty folks unless it's\nan extremist situation ... these are civilian responsibilities.\"\n\nKELLY: \"We should be very, very careful before we contemplate sending in\nactive duty.\"\n\nFormer Defense Secretary William Perry criticized Trump for threatening \"to\ndeploy American soldiers against American citizens\" and for putting himself\nbefore the Constitution.\n\nPERRY: \"It is both wrong and dangerous to threaten to deploy American soldiers\nagainst American citizens unless there is a complete breakdown of law and\norder in a state and the governor requests that assistance.\"\n\nPERRY: \"President Trump demands that members of his administration swear their\nloyalty to him, and those who demur do not stay long. But in the United\nStates, those who serve in the government and the military swear an oath to\nsupport the Constitution, not any individual. That is what makes our nation\ngreat.\"\n\nFormer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey condemned Trump's\nthreats as \"very dangerous\" and \"troubling.\"\n\nDEMPSEY: \"The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using\nthe military was troubling to me.'\n\nDEMPSEY: \"The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to\nsuppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests \\-- admittedly, where\nsome had opportunistically turned them violent -- and that the military would\nsomehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me.\"\n\nAdding to comments last week, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\nMike Mullen criticized Trump for using the military to \"fight our own people\"\nand warned that Trump's threats would cause the military to lose \"the trust of\nthe American people.\"\n\nMULLEN: \"We have a military to fight our enemies, not our own people. And our\nmilitary should never be called to fight our own people as enemies of the\nstate.\"\n\nMULLEN: \"In very short order, should we get into conflict in our own streets,\nthere's a very significant chance we could lose that trust that has taken us\n50-plus years to restore.\"\n\nFormer vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Sandy Winnefeld said Trump's\nactions had put civil-military relations at \"the most dangerous\" point in his\nlifetime and criticized the use of federal forces.\n\nWINNEFELD: \"We are at the most dangerous time for civil-military relations\nI've seen in my lifetime.\"\n\nWINNEFELD: \"It is especially important to reserve the use of federal forces\nfor only the most dire circumstances that actually threaten the survival of\nthe nation. Our senior-most military leaders need to ensure their political\nchain of command understands these things.\"\n\nTrump's former acting director of national intelligence, retired three-star\nadmiral Joseph Maguire, said he was in agreement with criticism of Trump from\nformer defense secretary Jim Mattis, Mullen, and Dempsey.\n\nMAGUIRE: \"Jim Mattis, Mike Mullen and Marty Dempsey are all good friends, and\nI respect them tremendously. I am in alignment with their views.\"\n\nRetired Navy four-star admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the raid that\nkilled Osama bin Laden, said Trump \"doesn't have the qualities necessary to be\na good commander in chief\" and that there was \"nothing morally right\" to use\nlaw enforcement to clear peaceful protesters.\n\nMcRAVEN: \"President Trump has shown he doesn't have the qualities necessary to\nbe a good commander in chief.\"\n\nMcRAVEN: \"You're not going to use, whether it's the military, or the National\nGuard, or law enforcement, to clear peaceful American citizens for the\npresident of the United States to do a photo op. There is nothing morally\nright about that.\"\n\nFormer commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan John Allen said Trump \"failed\"\nto show leadership and that Americans \"shouldn't tolerate\" his authoritarian\nactions.\n\nALLEN: \"The president has failed to show sympathy, empathy, compassion, or\nunderstanding--some of the traits the nation now needs from its highest\noffice. ... He failed to project any of the higher emotions or leadership\ndesperately needed in every quarter of this nation during this dire moment.\"\n\nALLEN: \"That is what happens in authoritarian regimes. That is what happens in\nilliberal regimes. It doesn't happen in the United States, and we shouldn't\ntolerate it.\"",

And we have to follow that\n<org>Constitution</org>. And the President has drifted away from it.\"</p>\n\n<p>POWELL: \"I certainly cannot in any way support <person>President Trump</person>\nthis year. ... I will be voting for [<person>Joe Biden</person>].\"</p>\n\n<p>Trump's former chief of staff, retired four-star <person>General John\nKelly</person>, said he would have \"argued against\" Trump forcefully\nclearing out peaceful protesters for a photo-op.</p>\n\n<p>KELLY: \"The idea that you would unleash American active duty\nfolks unless it's an extremist situation ... these are civilian\nresponsibilities.\"</p>\n\n<p>KELLY: \"We should be very, very careful before we contemplate\nsending in active duty.\"</p>\n\n<p>Former Defense Secretary <person>William Perry</person> criticized Trump for\nthreatening \"to deploy American soldiers against American\ncitizens\" and for putting himself before the <org>Constitution</org>.</p>\n\n<p>PERRY: \"It is both wrong and dangerous to threaten to deploy\nAmerican soldiers against American citizens unless there is a complete\nbreakdown of law and order in a state and the governor requests that\nassistance.\"</p>\n\n<p>PERRY: \"<person>President Trump</person> demands that members of his\nadministration swear their loyalty to him, and those who demur do not\nstay long. But in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, those who serve in the government\nand the military swear an oath to support the <org>Constitution</org>, not any\nindividual. That is what makes our nation great.\"</p>\n\n<p>Former Chairman of the <org>Joint Chiefs</org> of Staff <person value=\"APIN:3318846247\">Martin Dempsey</person>\ncondemned Trump's threats as \"very dangerous\" and\n\"troubling.\"</p>\n\n<p>DEMPSEY: \"The idea that the president would take charge of the\nsituation using the military was troubling to me.'</p>\n\n<p>DEMPSEY: \"The idea that the military would be called in to\ndominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests\n-- admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent --\nand that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was\nvery dangerous to me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Adding to comments last week, former Chairman of the <org>Joint Chiefs</org>\nof Staff <person value=\"APIN:1377484671\">Mike Mullen</person> criticized Trump for using the military to\n\"fight our own people\" and warned that Trump's threats\nwould cause the military to lose \"the trust of the American\npeople.\"</p>\n\n<p>MULLEN: \"We have a military to fight our enemies, not our own\npeople. And our military should never be called to fight our own people\nas enemies of the state.\"</p>\n\n<p>MULLEN: \"In very short order, should we get into conflict in\nour own streets, there's a very significant chance we could lose\nthat trust that has taken us 50-plus years to restore.\"</p>\n\n<p>Former vice chairman of the <org>Joint Chiefs</org> of Staff <person>Sandy Winnefeld</person>\nsaid Trump's actions had put civil-military relations at \"the\nmost dangerous\" point in his lifetime and criticized the use of\nfederal forces.</p>\n\n<p>WINNEFELD: \"We are at the most dangerous time for\ncivil-military relations I've seen in my lifetime.\"</p>\n\n<p>WINNEFELD: \"It is especially important to reserve the use of\nfederal forces for only the most dire circumstances that actually\nthreaten the survival of the nation. Our senior-most military leaders\nneed to ensure their political chain of command understands these\nthings.\"</p>\n\n<p>Trump's former acting director of national intelligence,\nretired three-star admiral <person>Joseph Maguire</person>, said he was in agreement with\ncriticism of Trump from former defense secretary <person>Jim Mattis</person>, Mullen, and\nDempsey.</p>\n\n<p>MAGUIRE: \"<person>Jim Mattis</person>, <person value=\"APIN:1377484671\">Mike Mullen</person> and <person value=\"APIN:3318846247\">Marty Dempsey</person> are all\ngood friends, and I respect them tremendously. I am in alignment with\ntheir views.\"</p>\n\n<p>Retired <org>Navy</org> four-star admiral <person>William McRaven</person>, who oversaw the\nraid that killed <person>Osama bin Laden</person>, said Trump \"doesn't have the\nqualities necessary to be a good commander in chief\" and that there\nwas \"nothing morally right\" to use law enforcement to clear\npeaceful protesters.</p>\n\n<p>McRAVEN: \"<person>President Trump</person> has shown he doesn't have the\nqualities necessary to be a good commander in chief.\"</p>\n\n<p>McRAVEN: \"You're not going to use, whether it's the\nmilitary, or the <org>National Guard</org>, or law enforcement, to clear peaceful\nAmerican citizens for the president of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> to do a photo\nop.
