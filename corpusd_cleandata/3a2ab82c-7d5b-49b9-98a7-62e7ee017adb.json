    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Disease\nPrevention Daily \\-- Researchers detail new data in type 2 diabetes. According\nto news originating from Sari, Iran, by NewsRx correspondents, research\nstated, \"Dyslipidemia is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular\ndisease in people with diabetes. The principle of diabetes prevention and\ncontrol is based on patient self-care and education.\"\n\nOur news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Mazandaran\nUniversity of Medical Sciences: \"The Islamic self-care nutrition method is a\ncommon and successful way to modify behavior in Islamic ethics and mysticism.\nThe study aimed to determine the effect of the Islamic self-care nutrition\nmethod on the lipid profile of patients with type 2 diabetes. The present\nclinical trial was conducted in 2014 on 98 middle-aged patients with type 2\ndiabetes referred to the Diabetes Center of the Mazandaran University of\nMedical Sciences, Sari, Iran, who were randomly allocated into two groups of\nexperimental and control. Lipid indices were measured before intervention, and\nthe same education about diabetic healthy diet was provided in both groups. In\naddition, in the experimental group, Islamic teachings and the Islamic self-\ncare method of nutrition were taught with the intention of pleasing God. Data\nwere analyzed with SPSS 22 software using independent and paired t-test, Chi-\nsquare, Fisher's exact, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). After adjusting\nfor the effect of confounding variables with ANCOVA, significant improvement\nwas observed in triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein indices in the\nexperimental group after intervention compared to the control group. Two-\nproportion z-test results showed a significant increase in the use of lipid-\nlowering drugs in the control group compared with the experimental group after\nintervention.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The Islamic self-care\nnutrition method could be used to control chronic diseases such as type 2\ndiabetes affected by behavioral factors.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Effect of the Islamic Self-care\nNutrition Method on the Lipid Profile of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A\nRandomized Clinical Controlled Trial. _Open Access Macedonian Journal of\nMedical Sciences_ , 2020,8(B).

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Disease Prevention Daily</org> -- Researchers detail new data in type 2 diabetes. According to news originating from Sari, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Dyslipidemia is one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. The principle of diabetes prevention and control is based on patient self-care and education.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from <org>Mazandaran University</org> of Medical Sciences: &#8220;The Islamic self-care nutrition method is a common and successful way to modify behavior in Islamic ethics and mysticism. The study aimed to determine the effect of the Islamic self-care nutrition method on the lipid profile of patients with type 2 diabetes. The present clinical trial was conducted in 2014 on 98 middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes referred to the <org>Diabetes Center of the Mazandaran University</org> of Medical Sciences, Sari, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>, who were randomly allocated into two groups of experimental and control. Lipid indices were measured before intervention, and the same education about diabetic healthy diet was provided in both groups. In addition, in the experimental group, Islamic teachings and the Islamic self-care method of nutrition were taught with the intention of pleasing God. Data were analyzed with SPSS 22 software using independent and paired t-test, Chi-square, Fisher&#8217;s exact, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). After adjusting for the effect of confounding variables with ANCOVA, significant improvement was observed in triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein indices in the experimental group after intervention compared to the control group. Two-proportion z-test results showed a significant increase in the use of lipid-lowering drugs in the control group compared with the experimental group after intervention.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;The Islamic self-care nutrition method could be used to control chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes affected by behavioral factors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Effect of the Islamic Self-care Nutrition Method on the Lipid Profile of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Controlled Trial. <em><org>Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences</org></em>, 2020,8(B).
