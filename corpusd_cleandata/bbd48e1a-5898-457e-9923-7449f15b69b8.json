    "text": "Boca Raton, FL: Florida Atlantic University has issued the following news\nrelease:\n\nFlorida Atlantic University's Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters\nrecently announced that the Department of Music received Impact 100 Palm Beach\nCounty's Arts, Culture and Historic Preservation Grant. The $100,000 grant\nwill be used for \"Keep the Music Playing!,\" an initiative to provide music\nlessons for at-risk middle and high school students.\n\nFor the past 17 years, FAU has held a summer band camp for elementary-aged,\neconomically-challenged students. Under the direction of Kyle Prescott,\nD.M.A., director of bands, these kids have come to the Boca Raton campus to\nlearn how to play an instrument with lessons provided by FAU students. The\ncamps have culminated in concerts attended by families, often in awe of how\nfar their children progressed in one week. Up until now, that was the end of\nFAU's role in those students' music lessons, and many were not able to\ncontinue instruction as public schools struggle to maintain music programs.\nWith this grant, these lessons will continue for middle and high school\nstudents during the upcoming academic year and for summer 2021.\n\n\"The transition into middle school and again into high school is a difficult\ntime for students,\" said Prescott. \"They are being pulled in every direction\nwith social pressures, a new environment and emotional crises, all of which\ncontribute to drawing students out of music programs, and often out of school\nentirely. Keep the Music Playing will identify these students and give them\none-one-one instrument lessons, igniting the love for music our FAU students\ndemonstrate each day.\"\n\nSeveral studies done by the National Education Association have shown that\nstudents who have access to the arts tend to have better academic results,\nbetter workforce opportunities and more civic engagement. Under the direction\nof Prescott along with DaLaine Chapman, Ph.D., associate professor of music\neducation, FAU students will work with these aspiring musicians over the\ncourse of two years, encouraging them to stay in band, stay in school, and\nbuild the skills that will make them into successful students and lifelong\nartists.\n\n\"Part of our mission as a public university is to work with community schools\nlike those targeted in this project and support the educators dedicated to our\nunderserved students in Palm Beach County,\" said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean\nof the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters. \"We are honored to have\nbeen chosen for this grant by this incredible organization.\"\n\nImpact 100 Palm Beach County is a women's charitable organization funding\nlocal nonprofit initiatives in southern Palm Beach County. This is the first\ntime that an FAU initiative has been chosen for a $100,000 grant by Impact\n100.\n\n\"We are looking forward to seeing the many positive aspects of this program\ncome to fruition,\" said Chapman. \"The effect it will have on our community, as\nwell as the teaching opportunities for our FAU music education students is a\nwin-win!\"",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.bocton\">Boca Raton, FL</location>: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3647398135\">Florida Atlantic University</org> has issued the\nfollowing news release:</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3647398135\">Florida Atlantic University's</org> <org>Dorothy F. Schmidt College of\nArts and Letters</org> recently announced that the <org>Department of Music</org>\nreceived Impact 100 Palm Beach County's Arts, Culture and Historic\nPreservation Grant. The <money>$100,000</money> grant will be used for \"Keep the\nMusic Playing!,\" an initiative to provide music lessons for at-risk\nmiddle and high school students.</p>\n\n<p>For the past 17 years, FAU has held a summer band camp for\nelementary-aged, economically-challenged students. Under the direction\nof <person>Kyle Prescott</person>, D.M.A., director of bands, these kids have come to the\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.bocton\">Boca Raton</location> campus to learn how to play an instrument with lessons\nprovided by FAU students. The camps have culminated in concerts attended\nby families, often in awe of how far their children progressed in one\nweek. Up until now, that was the end of FAU's role in those\nstudents' music lessons, and many were not able to continue\ninstruction as public schools struggle to maintain music programs. With\nthis grant, these lessons will continue for middle and high school\nstudents during the upcoming academic year and for summer 2021.</p>\n\n<p>\"The transition into middle school and again into high school\nis a difficult time for students,\" said Prescott. \"They are\nbeing pulled in every direction with social pressures, a new environment\nand emotional crises, all of which contribute to drawing students out of\nmusic programs, and often out of school entirely. Keep the Music Playing\nwill identify these students and give them one-one-one instrument\nlessons, igniting the love for music our FAU students demonstrate each\nday.\"</p>\n\n<p>Several studies done by the <org>National Education Association</org> have\nshown that students who have access to the arts tend to have better\nacademic results, better workforce opportunities and more civic\nengagement. Under the direction of Prescott along with <person>DaLaine Chapman</person>,\nPh.D., associate professor of music education, FAU students will work\nwith these aspiring musicians over the course of two years, encouraging\nthem to stay in band, stay in school, and build the skills that will\nmake them into successful students and lifelong artists.</p>\n\n<p>\"Part of our mission as a public university is to work with\ncommunity schools like those targeted in this project and support the\neducators dedicated to our underserved students in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.palach\">Palm Beach\nCounty</location>,\" said <person>Michael Horswell</person>, Ph.D., dean of the <org>Dorothy F.\nSchmidt College of Arts and Letters</org>. \"We are honored to have been\nchosen for this grant by this incredible organization.\"</p>\n\n<p>Impact 100 Palm Beach County is a women's charitable\norganization funding local nonprofit initiatives in southern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.palach\">Palm Beach\nCounty</location>. This is the first time that an FAU initiative has been chosen\nfor a <money>$100,000</money> grant by Impact 100.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are looking forward to seeing the many positive aspects of\nthis program come to fruition,\" said Chapman. \"The effect it\nwill have on our community, as well as the teaching opportunities for\nour FAU music education students is a win-win!\"</p>",
