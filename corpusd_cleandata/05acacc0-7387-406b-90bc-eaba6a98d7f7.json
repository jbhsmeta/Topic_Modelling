    "text": "Phillipsburg does not often hold its own version of national protests. It will\non Saturday with a march down Main Street against racism.\n\nLakeisha Alexander, a resident who is organizing the peaceful demonstration\ncalled Walk With Us, told [lehighvalleylive.com](http://lehighvalleylive.com)\nthat residents who experience bigotry want their voices heard, and that others\nneed to realize it happens in Warren County as well as major cities where\nprotests have been ongoing for a week or more.\n\n\"There's racism here. There's racism everywhere,\" Alexander said.\n\nWalk With Us is scheduled for noon Saturday, starting at Shappell Park, with a\nSunday rain date. At least 600 people have responded to the event's Facebook\npage.\n\nMayor Todd Tersigni confirmed he will attend the walk. Police Chief Robert\nStettner will also be there, along with officers both ensuring safety and\nparticipating in the demonstration.\n\n\"This is our time to listen. And that's what we're there to do,\" Stettner\nsaid.\n\nThis march, while inspired by other protests over the death of George Floyd in\nMinnesota as a police officer knelt on his neck, is not a demonstration\nagainst police but a show of strength against racism in general, Alexander\nsaid.\n\nShe and her family described ways they say bigotry appears in the community,\nboth overtly - like someone calling Alexander's son the N-word - and subtly,\nlike a lack of emphasis on Black History Month at school.\n\n\"It's not the police,\" Alexander said. \"It's the people.\"\n\nSteve Novak, NJ Advance Media,\n[snovak@lehighvalleylive.com](mailto:snovak@lehighvalleylive.com)",

    "html": "<p>Phillipsburg does not often hold its own version of national protests. It will on Saturday with a march down <location>Main Street</location> against racism.</p>\n<p><person>Lakeisha Alexander</person>, a resident who is organizing the peaceful demonstration called Walk With Us, told <a href=\"http://lehighvalleylive.com\">lehighvalleylive.com</a> that residents who experience bigotry want their voices heard, and that others need to realize it happens in Warren County as well as major cities where protests have been ongoing for a week or more.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's racism here. There's racism everywhere,\" Alexander said.</p>\n\n<p>Walk With Us is scheduled for noon Saturday, starting at <location>Shappell Park</location>, with a Sunday rain date. At least 600 people have responded to the event's Facebook page.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor <person>Todd Tersigni</person> confirmed he will attend the walk. Police Chief <person>Robert Stettner</person> will also be there, along with officers both ensuring safety and participating in the demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is our time to listen. And that's what we're there to do,\" Stettner said.</p>\n\n<p>This march, while inspired by other protests over the death of <person>George Floyd</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location> as a police officer knelt on his neck, is not a demonstration against police but a show of strength against racism in general, Alexander said.</p>\n\n<p>She and her family described ways they say bigotry appears in the community, both overtly - like someone calling Alexander's son the N-word - and subtly, like a lack of emphasis on Black History Month at school.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not the police,\" Alexander said. \"It's the people.\"</p>\n\n<p>Steve Novak, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2655353283\">NJ Advance Media</org>, <a href=\"mailto:snovak@lehighvalleylive.com\">snovak@lehighvalleylive.com</a></p>",
