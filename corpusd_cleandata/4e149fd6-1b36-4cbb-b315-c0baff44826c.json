    "text": "UNC Charlotte's Energy Production and Infrastructure Center--also known as\nEPIC--prides itself on preparing students and the future workforce for any\nsituation that could impact the energy sector and electric grid. Formed\nthrough private and public funding in response to the need to supply well-\neducated and highly trained engineers qualified to meet the demands of the\nenergy industry and to provide sustainable support for applied research, EPIC\nproduces a technical workforce and advancements in technology for the global\nenergy industry while supporting the Carolinas' multi-state economic and\nenergy security. Executive Director Michael Mazzola discussed how EPIC and its\naffiliated partners are working together to train the next generation of\nenergy professionals to deliver solutions for the industry in a brief\ninterview.\n\nNo one can predict when emergencies, such as the CO VID-19 pandemic, can hit\nand how they will impact the energy sector. What steps have you taken to\nprepare students and workers for events like this? Are you seeing any current\nthreats to the operations of the electric grid?\n\nThe energy industry that EPIC serves is among the most critical in our\ncommunity. The national organization that helps ensure electric power service\nis reliable and affordable is called the North American Electric Reliability\nCorporation (NERC). Between NERC and the utilities themselves, there has been\na tremendous effort to ensure that the people that run the electric grid stay\nhealthy. This is a highly trained, NERC-certified group of virtually\nirreplaceable engineers and control room operators. Some utilities are turning\ntheir backup control rooms into mini villages where, in some cases, the\ncontrol room operators' families have taken up residence. This is an\nimpressive display of commitment to serve our community from the employees and\nmanagers in our electric utilities, for which every citizen should be\ngrateful.\n\nCan you tell us about your partnership with SOS and its student training\nopportunities?\n\nOne initiative that we undertook with SOS, a company in our EPIC Affiliates\nProgram, is a scholarship to help some of our engineering students graduate\nwith a NERC certification. Traditionally, control room operators have not had\nan engineering degree. But a trend has begun in the industry to have at least\nsome operators be engineers. This is a reflection of how complex the modern\ngrid is becoming. EPIC is committed to helping educate engineers to be turnkey\nready for employment in the energy industry. Our partnership with SOS, a major\nprovider of courses and training leading to NERC control room operator\ncertification, is a unique program among university engineering programs.\n\nSpeaking of events that can impact our utilities, our region has recently seen\na slew of storms impact our power grid, is EPIC involved in research involving\ngrid resiliency?\n\nAn aspect of EPIC's mission is to support the energy industry with timely and\npractical applied research and development. Some of our research addresses the\ncomplex convergence between technology, economics, and social policy. For\nexample, EPIC supported the development of the North Carolina Clean Energy\nPlan. A question spawned from that plan is the public value of preparing for\nthe next hurricane by investing in electric grid modernization now. EPIC is\nthe technical lead of a major study for the N.C. Department of Environmental\nQuality and the U.S. Department of Energy to find the right level of\ninvestment in grid modernization as a sort of insurance policy against\neconomic loss from devastating weather events such as hurricanes. Our\npartnership includes the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State\nUniversity, and the project is led by the North Carolina State Energy Officer,\nMs. Sushma Masemore. The goal is to reduce future economic devastation of the\ntype that all too many of our citizens have experienced from weather events,\neven before they had heard the word \"pandemic.\"\n\nCheck out the full Q&A with Michael Mazzola on our website,\n[businessnc.com](http://businessnc.com).",

    "title": "An EPIC solution.(SPONSORED SECTION: UNC Charlotte)",
    "html": "<p>UNC Charlotte's Energy Production and Infrastructure\nCenter--also known as EPIC--prides itself on preparing students and the\nfuture workforce for any situation that could impact the energy sector\nand electric grid. Formed through private and public funding in response\nto the need to supply well-educated and highly trained engineers\nqualified to meet the demands of the energy industry and to provide\nsustainable support for applied research, EPIC produces a technical\nworkforce and advancements in technology for the global energy industry\nwhile supporting the Carolinas' multi-state economic and energy\nsecurity. Executive Director <person>Michael Mazzola</person> discussed how EPIC and its\naffiliated partners are working together to train the next generation of\nenergy professionals to deliver solutions for the industry in a brief\ninterview.</p>\n\n<p>No one can predict when emergencies, such as the CO VID-19\npandemic, can hit and how they will impact the energy sector. What steps\nhave you taken to prepare students and workers for events like this? Are\nyou seeing any current threats to the operations of the electric grid?</p>\n\n<p>The energy industry that EPIC serves is among the most critical in\nour community. The national organization that helps ensure electric\npower service is reliable and affordable is called the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4116593271\">North American\nElectric Reliability Corporation</org> (NERC). Between NERC and the utilities\nthemselves, there has been a tremendous effort to ensure that the people\nthat run the electric grid stay healthy. This is a highly trained,\nNERC-certified group of virtually irreplaceable engineers and control\nroom operators. Some utilities are turning their backup control rooms\ninto mini villages where, in some cases, the control room\noperators' families have taken up residence. This is an impressive\ndisplay of commitment to serve our community from the employees and\nmanagers in our electric utilities, for which every citizen should be\ngrateful.</p>\n\n<p>Can you tell us about your partnership with SOS and its student\ntraining opportunities?</p>\n\n<p>One initiative that we undertook with SOS, a company in our EPIC\nAffiliates Program, is a scholarship to help some of our engineering\nstudents graduate with a NERC certification. Traditionally, control room\noperators have not had an engineering degree. But a trend has begun in\nthe industry to have at least some operators be engineers. This is a\nreflection of how complex the modern grid is becoming. EPIC is committed\nto helping educate engineers to be turnkey ready for employment in the\nenergy industry. Our partnership with SOS, a major provider of courses\nand training leading to NERC control room operator certification, is a\nunique program among university engineering programs.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of events that can impact our utilities, our region has\nrecently seen a slew of storms impact our power grid, is EPIC involved\nin research involving grid resiliency?</p>\n\n<p>An aspect of EPIC's mission is to support the energy industry\nwith timely and practical applied research and development. Some of our\nresearch addresses the complex convergence between technology,\neconomics, and social policy. For example, EPIC supported the\ndevelopment of the North Carolina Clean Energy Plan. A question spawned\nfrom that plan is the public value of preparing for the next hurricane\nby investing in electric grid modernization now. EPIC is the technical\nlead of a major study for the <org>N.C. Department of Environmental Quality</org>\nand the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1037322296\">U.S. Department of Energy</org> to find the right level of investment\nin grid modernization as a sort of insurance policy against economic\nloss from devastating weather events such as hurricanes. Our partnership\nincludes the <location>N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center</location> at <org>N.C. State\nUniversity</org>, and the project is led by the North Carolina State Energy\nOfficer, Ms. <person>Sushma Masemore</person>. The goal is to reduce future economic\ndevastation of the type that all too many of our citizens have\nexperienced from weather events, even before they had heard the word\n\"pandemic.\"</p>\n\n<p>Check out the full Q&amp;A with <person>Michael Mazzola</person> on our website,\n<a href=\"http://businessnc.com\">businessnc.com</a>.</p>",
