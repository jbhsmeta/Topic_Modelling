    "text": "CENTREVILLE \\- Queen Anne's County ended the day Wednesday, May 27, with 152\nresidents having tested positive for COVID-19; two patients were hospitalized,\naccording to Beth Malasky, public information officer.\n\nAccording to the Queen Anne's County Health Department, 130 of those cases\nwere considered \"recovered\" and released from isolation as of Monday, May 25.\n\nHealth Officer Dr. Joseph Ciotola Jr. lists four deaths from the coronavirus\nin the county, while the state site shows 12. The other deaths all occurred at\nnursing homes or other long-term facilities in Kent and Anne Arundel counties,\nwhere the patients were infected and died. They didn't show up in the Queen\nAnne's numbers until their death certificates were issued listing their \"home\"\nresidence.\n\nTwo of the local deaths apparently are also from a nursing home. The Maryland\ncoronavirus website shows six staff cases and seven resident cases at Corsica\nHills Center in Centreville with two confirmed resident deaths.\n\nThe drive-thru test site at Chesapeake College tested another 37 people\nWednesday, Malasky said. The site is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday,\nWednesday and Friday for patients with a doctor's order.\n\nThe test site is a Mid-Shore effort with Queen Anne's, Talbot, Kent, Caroline\nand Dorchester counties all working together. It gives primary care doctors a\nway to get patients tested when they meet the criteria without their having to\ngo to the hospital.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, 1,207 people from the Eastern Shore and Anne Arundel\nCounty had been tested there.\n\nTalbot County Health Department said this week that the college test site\nwould be closing as of next Friday, June 5, but Malasky said she was unable to\nconfirm that.\n\nMany areas of Queen Anne's County have exceeded the seven positive cases\nrequired to be listed on the state's ZIP code map. Wednesday, the map showed\n10 positive cases in 21607 (Barclay); 33 cases in 21617 (Centreville); 15\ncases in 21619 (Chester); 12 cases in 21638 (Grasonville); 24 cases in 21666\n(Stevensville); 17 cases in 21668 (Sudlersville); 94 cases in 21649 (Marydel),\nwhich includes Caroline County; 23 cases in 21651 (Millington), which includes\nKent County; and 107 cases in 21620 (Chestertown), which includes Kent County.\n\nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious disease of the lungs. An updated list of\nsymptoms from the Centers for Disease Control includes cough, shortness of\nbreath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills/repeated shaking with chills,\nheadache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell. Additional symptoms\nreported in children may include fever, runny nose, cough, vomiting and\ndiarrhea.\n\nCOVID-19 is spread by contact with an infected person, usually through\ncoughing and sneezing or between people who are in close contact with one\nanother (within 6 feet). It is also possible that people can become infected\nby touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it and then touching\ntheir own mouth, nose and possibly eyes. COVID-19 is a new virus in humans;\nmost people have little or no immunity.\n\nAll residents are instructed to continue with social distancing and if having\nsymptoms to contact their doctor. Persons who have been exposed to the virus\nhave the potential to infect others before they display symptoms.\n\nQueen Anne's County Health Department has an information line for the public\nto call with questions about COVID-19. Staff will be available by phone from 8\na.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday at 443-262-9900.",

The other deaths all occurred at nursing homes or other long-term facilities in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.kent\">Kent</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.anndel\">Anne Arundel</location> counties, where the patients were infected and died. They didn't show up in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.quees\">Queen Anne's</location> numbers until their death certificates were issued listing their \"home\" residence.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the local deaths apparently are also from a nursing home. The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location> coronavirus website shows six staff cases and seven resident cases at Corsica Hills Center in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.cenlle\">Centreville</location> with two confirmed resident deaths.</p>\n\n<p>The drive-thru test site at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2812110013\">Chesapeake College</org> tested another 37 people Wednesday, Malasky said. The site is open from <chron>10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday</chron> for patients with a doctor's order.</p>\n\n<p>The test site is a Mid-Shore effort with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.quees\">Queen Anne's</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.talbot\">Talbot</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.kent\">Kent</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.carine\">Caroline</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.dorche\">Dorchester</location> counties all working together. It gives primary care doctors a way to get patients tested when they meet the criteria without their having to go to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>As of Wednesday evening, 1,207 people from the <location>Eastern Shore</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.anndel\">Anne Arundel County</location> had been tested there.</p>\n\n<p><org>Talbot County Health Department</org> said this week that the college test site would be closing as of next <chron>Friday, June 5</chron>, but Malasky said she was unable to confirm that.</p>\n\n<p>Many areas of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.quees\">Queen Anne's County</location> have exceeded the seven positive cases required to be listed on the state's ZIP code map. Wednesday, the map showed 10 positive cases in 21607 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.barlay\">Barclay</location>); 33 cases in 21617 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.cenlle\">Centreville</location>); 15 cases in 21619 (Chester); 12 cases in 21638 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.gralle\">Grasonville</location>); 24 cases in 21666 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.stelle\">Stevensville</location>); 17 cases in 21668 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.sudlle\">Sudlersville</location>); 94 cases in 21649 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.mardel\">Marydel</location>), which includes <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.carine\">Caroline County</location>; 23 cases in 21651 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.migton\">Millington</location>), which includes <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.kent\">Kent County</location>; and 107 cases in 21620 (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.cheown\">Chestertown</location>), which includes <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.kent\">Kent County</location>.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease of the lungs. An updated list of symptoms from the <org>Centers for Disease Control</org> includes cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills/repeated shaking with chills, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell. Additional symptoms reported in children may include fever, runny nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 is spread by contact with an infected person, usually through coughing and sneezing or between people who are in close contact with one another (within 6 feet). It is also possible that people can become infected by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose and possibly eyes. COVID-19 is a new virus in humans; most people have little or no immunity.</p>\n\n<p>All residents are instructed to continue with social distancing and if having symptoms to contact their doctor. Persons who have been exposed to the virus have the potential to infect others before they display symptoms.</p>\n\n<p><person>Queen Anne's</person> <org>County Health Department</org> has an information line for the public to call with questions about COVID-19. Staff will be available by phone from <chron>8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday</chron> at 443-262-9900.</p>",
