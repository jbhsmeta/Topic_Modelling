    "text": "To the editor:\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants to put his thumb on the scales of freedom and\njustice to protect himself from \"fact checking\" by the mainstream media. Yet,\nhe would allow the partisan conservative media to lie, as he does, thousands\nof times.\n\nWhat set off our \"stable genius\" was when Twitter applied a fact-check to two\nof Trump's tweets, including one that falsely claimed mail-in ballots would\nlead to widespread voter fraud.\n\nWhile the president has regularly accused mainstream sites of censoring\nconservative speech, Trump has never accused conservative sites of censoring.\n\nThe GOP stands fully behind the executive order to ban statements that are\n\"potentially misleading\" meaning the conservatives can freely lie to America,\nwhile forbidding the \"fact checking\" that contradicts their statements.\n\nThis would allow Trump and the GOP to control what they view as the truth, a\ntechnique that the Russian dictator uses to control elections and stay in\noffice for life.\n\nTrump has already said, \"When somebody is the president of the United States,\n(his) authority is total.\"\n\n\"If I didn't appoint this (investigating) IG, he's gone or she's gone. If I\ndon't like what they're saying, I'm going to stop them from saying it.\"\n\nDidn't another Republican president try that?\n\nWhy do only Republicans act this way? Didn't they take an oath, as Democratic\npresidents do, upon entering office? Don't they understand the concept of\ntamper-free elections, per the Constitution? Trump and his supporters are not\nprotecting our rights, only their futures and earning power.\n\nJohn Wade\n\nNorton",

Yet, he would allow the partisan conservative media to lie, as he does, thousands of times.</p>\n\n<p>What set off our \"stable genius\" was when Twitter applied a fact-check to two of Trump's tweets, including one that falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to widespread voter fraud.</p>\n\n<p>While the president has regularly accused mainstream sites of censoring conservative speech, Trump has never accused conservative sites of censoring.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3974939109\">GOP</org> stands fully behind the executive order to ban statements that are \"potentially misleading\" meaning the conservatives can freely lie to America, while forbidding the \"fact checking\" that contradicts their statements.</p>\n\n<p>This would allow Trump and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3974939109\">GOP</org> to control what they view as the truth, a technique that the Russian dictator uses to control elections and stay in office for life.</p>\n\n<p>Trump has already said, \"When somebody is the president of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, (his) authority is total.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"If I didn't appoint this (investigating) IG, he's gone or she's gone. If I don't like what they're saying, I'm going to stop them from saying it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Didn't another Republican president try that?</p>\n\n<p>Why do only <org>Republicans</org> act this way? Didn't they take an oath, as Democratic presidents do, upon entering office? Don't they understand the concept of tamper-free elections, per the <org>Constitution</org>? Trump and his supporters are not protecting our rights, only their futures and earning power.</p>\n\n<p><person>John Wade</person></p>\n\n<p>Norton</p>",
