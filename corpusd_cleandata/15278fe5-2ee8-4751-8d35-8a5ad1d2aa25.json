    "text": "The Ministry of Production (Produce) today approved the reopening of three\nmarkets in the capital, which complied with implementing biosecurity measures,\nguaranteeing that it is a space free of COVID-19, for its visitors. These are\nthe San Pedro de Unicachi market in Comas, Plaza Villa Sur in Villa El\nSalvador and Micaela Bastidas in Villa Mara del Triunfo.\n\nThe Produce team arrived at these establishments, headed by the deputy\nminister of Mype and Industry, Jos Salardi, and the technicians of the\nNational Productive Diversification Program (PNDP).\n\nThe first market inspected was the San Pedro de Unicachi market, in Comas,\nwhere the representatives of this ministry with municipal personnel from that\ncommune, found a new face of the establishment, after having been closed for\n18 days.\n\nFor example, it was observed that floor change work was carried out, likewise,\nthe signs were complied with and handrails were implemented between the posts,\nto guarantee social distancing between buyers, suppliers and workers.\n\nIn addition, a portable sink was installed at the entrance of the food market,\nand a staff was available to perform the temperature control.\n\n\"We already have the market ready to reopen tomorrow, we have seen that all\nthe guidelines given by Production have been met, there are notable changes\nand it is going to be able to reopen obviously with a reduced capacity, here\ngenerally 4000 people enter, but now 1200 will do so \"Stressed the vice\nminister.\n\nAfter this inspection, the team from the Ministry of Production moved to the\nfollowing two markets, where the adoption of health and safety measures was\nalso observed, after constant monitoring of this sector and the Municipalities\nof Villa El Salvador and Villa Mara of Triumph.\n\nBoth managed to implement micas between the stalls, washhouses, footbaths and\nsignage to order the market capacity.\n\nIt is worth noting that Produce promotes compliance with Supreme Decree No.\n011-2020-PRODUCE, so that the supply centers adopt biosecurity measures, to\navoid their closure, or failing that, to approve their reopening.\n\nThis is also framed to the fulfillment of goals of the Incentive Program for\nthe Improvement of Municipal Management, established in DS 099-2020-EF.\nThrough this, resources will be granted to the communes that comply with\nregulating the operation of their supply markets and create temporary spaces\nfor commerce, in order to reduce crowding inside and outside these points of\nsale to prevent and contain Covid -19.",

These are the San Pedro de Unicachi market in Comas, <location>Plaza Villa Sur</location> in <location>Villa El Salvador</location> and <person>Micaela Bastidas</person> in <location>Villa Mara del Triunfo</location>.</p>\n<p>The Produce team arrived at these establishments, headed by the deputy minister of Mype and Industry, <person>Jos Salardi</person>, and the technicians of the National Productive Diversification Program (PNDP).</p>\n<p>The first market inspected was the San Pedro de Unicachi market, in Comas, where the representatives of this ministry with municipal personnel from that commune, found a new face of the establishment, after having been closed for 18 days.</p>\n<p>For example, it was observed that floor change work was carried out, likewise, the signs were complied with and handrails were implemented between the posts, to guarantee social distancing between buyers, suppliers and workers.</p>\n<p>In addition, a portable sink was installed at the entrance of the food market, and a staff was available to perform the temperature control.</p>\n<p>\"We already have the market ready to reopen tomorrow, we have seen that all the guidelines given by Production have been met, there are notable changes and it is going to be able to reopen obviously with a reduced capacity, here generally 4000 people enter, but now 1200 will do so \"Stressed the vice minister.</p>\n<p>After this inspection, the team from the <org>Ministry of Production</org> moved to the following two markets, where the adoption of health and safety measures was also observed, after constant monitoring of this sector and the Municipalities of <location>Villa El Salvador</location> and <location>Villa Mara</location> of Triumph.</p>\n<p>Both managed to implement micas between the stalls, washhouses, footbaths and signage to order the market capacity.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that Produce promotes compliance with Supreme Decree No. 011-2020-PRODUCE, so that the supply centers adopt biosecurity measures, to avoid their closure, or failing that, to approve their reopening.</p>\n<p>This is also framed to the fulfillment of goals of the Incentive Program for the Improvement of Municipal Management, established in DS 099-2020-EF. Through this, resources will be granted to the communes that comply with regulating the operation of their supply markets and create temporary spaces for commerce, in order to reduce crowding inside and outside these points of sale to prevent and contain Covid -19.</p>",
