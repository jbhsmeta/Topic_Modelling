    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily\nNews \\-- A new study on Environmental Pollution is now available. According to\nnews originating from Tamil Nadu, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research\nstated, \"In the last few decades, consciousness of fossil fuel resources and\nincreased environmental concerns have given the need for emergence of\nalternative fuel. Biodiesel is one of the potential renewable energies\nproduced from edible and non-edible biomass which could be a potential\nalternative for petrol-derived diesel.\"\n\nFinancial support for this research came from Council of Scientific &\nIndustrial Research, India.\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Anna University,\n\"In this work, initially the process of biodiesel production from waste\ncooking oil using potassium hydroxide as catalyst and the process parameters\nwere studied in laboratory. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97% was attained at\n75 degrees C with 1 wt% catalyst concentration and oil-methanol molar ratio of\n1:06 at 350 rpm and 90 min. Also, these process conditions were used for\nbiodiesel production in the pilot plant and obtained 97% yield. Overall, mass\nbalance for the pilot plant was studied to analyze the product yield loss. The\nfatty acid methyl ester formation in the plant was confirmed by\ncharacterization with FTIR and H-1 NMR.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Further, the quality\nof biodiesel produced was compared for its physiochemical properties with the\nASTM standards.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Feasibility of Biodiesel Production\nFrom Waste Cooking Oil: Lab-scale To Pilot-scale Analysis. _Environmental\nScience and Pollution Research_ , 2020;():. _Environmental Science and\nPollution Research_ can be contacted at: Springer Heidelberg,\nTiergartenstrasse 17, D-69121 Heidelberg, Germany.

Devaraj, Anna University, Alagappa College of Technology, Dept. of\nApplied Sciences and Technologies, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India.\nAdditional authors for this research include Y. Mani, S.A.A.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Ecology Daily News</org> -- A new study on Environmental Pollution is now available. According to news originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.tn\">Tamil Nadu, India</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;In the last few decades, consciousness of fossil fuel resources and increased environmental concerns have given the need for emergence of alternative fuel. Biodiesel is one of the potential renewable energies produced from edible and non-edible biomass which could be a potential alternative for petrol-derived diesel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Financial support for this research came from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1818233039\">Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from <org>Anna University</org>, &#8220;In this work, initially the process of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using potassium hydroxide as catalyst and the process parameters were studied in laboratory. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97% was attained at 75 degrees C with 1 wt% catalyst concentration and oil-methanol molar ratio of 1:06 at 350 rpm and 90 min. Also, these process conditions were used for biodiesel production in the pilot plant and obtained 97% yield. Overall, mass balance for the pilot plant was studied to analyze the product yield loss. The fatty acid methyl ester formation in the plant was confirmed by characterization with FTIR and H-1 NMR.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Further, the quality of biodiesel produced was compared for its physiochemical properties with the ASTM standards.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Feasibility of Biodiesel Production From Waste Cooking Oil: Lab-scale To Pilot-scale Analysis. <em><org>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</org></em>, 2020;():. <em><org>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</org></em> can be contacted at: Springer Heidelberg, Tiergartenstrasse 17, D-69121 Heidelberg, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>.
