    "text": "NEW DELHI, June 5 \\-- Lok Nayak Hospital has expressed condolences to the\nfamily of Late Lakhjeet Singh, who succumbed to COVID-19 this morning after\none of the family members shared version claiming that hospital refused to\nadmit the patient. However, the Hospital administration said that patient was\nnot refused admission and was examined by doctor.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Hospital, it said that the grieving family member\nof the deceased has shared a version of events on social media regarding the\nunfortunate passing away of her father. \"It is being implied that the death\noccurred due to the hospital authorities' refusal of admission. While we fully\nstand by the family in this difficult time, it is important to place the facts\non record,\" it said.\n\n\"The administration and staff of Lok Nayak Hospital expresses our heartfelt\ncondolences to the family of Late Shri Lakhjeet Singh, who succumbed to\nCOVID-19 this morning,\" the hospital said in a statement.\n\n\"The first tweet regarding the alleged refusal to admit the patient was posted\nat 8:05 AM (that hospital was refusing admission and they were standing\noutside the hospital) and subsequently at 9:08 AM the news of the patient's\npassing away was shared. Upon investigating the incident, it was found that\nthe Lok Nayak Hospital's auto-generated electronic casualty record had\nregistered the patient in question as \"Brought Dead\" at 7:37 AM,\" it said.\n\nThe hospital staff on duty has confirmed that the patient was brought in to\nthe hospital between 7:10 and 7:30 AM, it said, adding that he hospital wishes\nto clarify that the patient was not refused admission and was examined by\ndoctors upon being brought in.\n\nThe hospital staff is working non-stop for the last several months and are\nmaking every effort possible to ensure not a single life is lost, it said.\n\nWhen incorrect and false claims are made about the hospital staff and widely\npublicised on the internet, it severely demoralises them and hurts their\nmorale, it further said, adding that Lok Nayak Hospital is committed to\nserving the people and making every attempt to save lives.\n\n\"We appeal to the public to show consideration towards the hospital staff in\nthese extraordinary circumstances,\" it added.
