    "text": "June 05 \\-- Ajay (25), who ended his life after reportedly losing work due to\nthe lockdown, was an epitome of hope for his father Nawab (50), who had\nfractured his leg three years ago while working as a door-to-door waste\ncollector. The injury never healed and Nawab was unable to work again.\n\nAs a result, the entire responsibility fell on the shoulders of Nawab's two\nsons -- Ajay and Vijay -- who worked hard to meet their father's expectations.\n\nThe duo used to collect garbage from around 180 houses in Sector 12 and earn\nRs100 per house, but the lockdown brought their family income down\nsignificantly. The family survived on dry ration and food packets provided by\nthe authorities and NGOs. However, things turned from bad to worse when some\n\"influential persons\" allegedly tricked the duo out of the job.\n\n\"A day before Ajay committed suicide, I urged those persons to call my sons\nback to work. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed to employers not to\nsack their workers, but the opposite happened. I dedicated my entire life\nworking for them and it has lost meaning now,\" said Nawab. \"We had no money to\nperform his last rites. My brother and neighbours came forward to help us\narrange his funeral,\" he said.\n\nThis is the second suicide reported from Rajiv Colony near Sector 17,\nPanchkula, apparently due to job loss during the lockdown.\n\nOn May 25, a 22-year-old youth had committed suicide after he ran out of money\nand had no food.\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has hit people living in slums hard. Two friends from\nthe adjoining Buddanpur -- Bablu Kumar (22) and Raju (20) -- who were engaged\nin glass fitting works, are a testament to large-scale job loss during the\nlockdown.\n\n\"We are not being called back to work. People who live in kothis fear\ncontracting Covid-19 from the ones who live in slums,\" said the duo.",

    "html": "<p><chron>June 05</chron> -- Ajay (25), who ended his life after reportedly losing work due to the lockdown, was an epitome of hope for his father Nawab (50), who had fractured his leg three years ago while working as a door-to-door waste collector. The injury never healed and Nawab was unable to work again.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>As a result, the entire responsibility fell on the shoulders of Nawab&#8217;s two sons &#8212; Ajay and Vijay &#8212; who worked hard to meet their father&#8217;s expectations.</p><p>The duo used to collect garbage from around 180 houses in Sector 12 and earn <money>Rs100</money> per house, but the lockdown brought their family income down significantly. The family survived on dry ration and food packets provided by the authorities and NGOs. However, things turned from bad to worse&#160;when some &#8220;influential persons&#8221; allegedly tricked the duo out of the job.</p><p>&#8220;A day before Ajay committed suicide, I urged those persons to call my sons back to work. Prime Minister <person>Narendra Modi</person> had appealed to employers not to sack their workers, but the opposite happened. I dedicated my entire life working for them and it has lost meaning now,&#8221; said Nawab. &#8220;We had no money to perform his last rites. My brother and neighbours came forward to help us arrange his funeral,&#8221; he said.</p><p>This is the second suicide reported from <person>Rajiv Colony</person> near Sector 17, Panchkula, apparently due to job loss during the lockdown.</p><p>On <chron>May 25</chron>, a 22-year-old youth had committed suicide after he ran out of money and had no food.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The Covid-19 outbreak has hit people living in slums hard. Two friends from the adjoining Buddanpur &#8212; <person>Bablu Kumar</person> (22) and Raju (20) &#8212; who were engaged in glass fitting works, are a testament to large-scale job loss during the lockdown.</p><p>&#8220;We are not being called back to work. People who live in kothis fear contracting Covid-19 from the ones who live in slums,&#8221; said the duo.</p>",
