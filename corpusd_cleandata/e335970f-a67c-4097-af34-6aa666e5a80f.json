    "text": "On an average day in 2019, the Texas Workforce Commission received about\n13,000 calls from Texans applying for unemployment benefits. Toward the end of\nthe year the state unemployment rate hovered under 4 percent: it had not risen\nmuch higher than 8 percent in three decades. Texas almost effortlessly added\njobs month to month, amid a rapidly expanding economy driven by population\ngrowth and a long-running energy boom that attracted vast sums of capital.\nLife was very, very good.\n\nBy the end of March this year, the commission was receiving, on average, 1.5\nmillion calls a day. The state's economy had collapsed almost overnight. The\nservice industry and its millions of jobs in now-empty restaurants and hotels\nand retail shops evaporated thanks to COVID-19. The energy boom had busted,\nwith the price of a barrel of oil well below what many industry players needed\nto survive. Desperate supplicants called the Workforce Commission hotline\nhundreds of times a day in the hope of reaching someone who could help them\npay rent or afford groceries, mostly without success. To stem the tide, the\ncommission unveiled a rudimentary chatbot, named Larry, to answer basic\nquestions. Applicants did not love Larry, who unhelpfully told them to call\nthe commission.\n\nWhen Texas comptroller Glenn Hegar warned that the state could soon see a\ndouble-digit unemployment rate, it was barely news. But the projection served\nto put state government on notice: the deluge will not be abating soon. The\ntwin shocks of the virus and the oil glut, which together constitute the\ngreatest economic calamity Texas has faced in a half century or more, threaten\nto stretch the state's institutions--and perhaps its politics--to the breaking\npoint. Never before has the Texas way of doing things faced a harsher test.\n\nSince the turn of the century, there has been an ongoing debate about the\nTexas model, sometimes referred to as the \"Texas Miracle,\" the regulatory and\npolitical system that greases the wheels of growth in the state. Proponents of\nthe Texas model point with great pride to an indisputable fact: the state\nescaped some of the most severe shocks of the Great Recession of 2007-2009,\nand job growth here has outperformed that of many other states in the years\nfollowing. Why?\n\nPredictably perhaps, Texas leaders emphasized the wisdom of Texas leaders--in\nmaintaining the state's low taxes, light regulations, and small-government\nphilosophy. Critics, including the liberal economist Paul Krugman, countered\nthat Texas's tax burden, regulatory framework, and government spending were in\nfact not particularly small, and argued that the state's oil boom, permissive\nland-use policies, and low cost of living were largely responsible.\n\nPoliticians benefited from a quirk of the economy: the service industry and\nthe energy sector tended to run on different clocks. When the service economy\ntook a devastating hit during the 2008 financial crash, amid foreclosures and\nfalling incomes, state budget writers were helped along, for a while, by oil\nprices, which ballooned to $147 a barrel in July of that year. And when prices\ncollapsed in 2014 and 2015 to less than $40 a barrel, the blow to state\nfinances was cushioned by the strength of the rest of the economy. Now, like\nThelma and Louise, the two pillars of the long boom years have joined hands\nand sped off a cliff.\n\nTexas will recover in some fashion, and maybe, with luck and wise leadership,\nthe boom will resume. In the meantime, the state will be subjected to a kind\nof stress test. Is there really anything special about Texas's economic engine\nthat can't be explained by healthy oil prices and a population explosion\ndriven by cheap housing? Do business-friendly policies and the lack of a state\nincome tax really goose the state's economic performance? And how will our\ncurrent generation of political leaders and institutions, who've grown\naccustomed to the good times, perform in a crunch? We're about to find out.\n\nTexas is a big state with big opportunities and big problems, even in the best\nof times. But for the last several decades, it's been a comparatively easy\nplace to govern. The Texas Legislature, unlike its unlucky counterparts in\nstates with stagnant tax bases and aging infrastructure, enters most sessions\neating high on the hog. Cut taxes, or boost spending? ?Porque no los dos?\n\nTo be sure, there have been tough budgets in the recent past. In the 2011\nsession, the Legislature cut $5.4 billion from public education funding. (As\nit turns out, the damage to schools was unnecessary.) But in general,\nlawmakers have plenty of wiggle room in their budgets. The comptroller's\nrevenue projections often have been lowballed, so lawmakers start their every-\nother-year legislative sessions with a bit of a surplus, allowing them to\nwrite the state's two-year budget with bumper rails.\n\nBut the Lege also writes its budgets with a kind of boom mentality, which\nleaves state agencies less resilient and less ready for bad times. For\nexample: lawmakers deliberately underfund the Texas Medicaid program, planning\nto fill it in with \"extra\" money during the next session. That kind of\nborrowing from the future to pay for the past only works in good times.\n\nAnother example, and one that is becoming more critical by the day, is the\nstate's unemployment trust fund, which the Texas Workforce Commission uses to\npay out claims to the people now swamping its call centers. The Wallstreet\nJournal reported in March that Texas was one of just six states with trust\nfunds that would likely be exhausted after six months. In late April, analysts\nat the nonprofit Tax Foundation estimated that the state could only afford the\npayouts for a couple more weeks.\n\nLater that month, the Workforce Commission asked the U.S. Labor Department for\na loan to bolster the fund, which may have to be repaid by raising employment\ntaxes on businesses. Given the number of unemployed persons in need, the tax\nhikes could be significant. That, of course, would be bad for the recovery.\nThe Legislature has shortchanged the trust fund during times of fiscal health,\nprecisely when it would have been easiest to fortify it, and that decision\ncould lead to a lot of unnecessary pain. The tide is going out, and the TWC\nprobably won't be the only boat stranded on the shore.\n\nHere's another example of the boom mentality. In the 2019 legislative session,\nyou may recall, the big-ticket item was a photogenic bill reforming the school\nfinance system. It was part of a sprawling package that capped the amount of\ntaxes that local governments and schools can collect while simultaneously\nputting an additional $6.5 billion into public education. State lawmakers were\nextremely proud of this twofer of property tax relief and more money for\nschools. They convened a lot of back slapping press conferences. They took\npictures with a golden retriever.\n\nBut there was one little problem: they didn't attach a specific funding source\nto the legislation. So the bill only did what it was supposed to do as long as\nmoney was still coming in hand over fist. If there was a crash, the\nLegislature might be forced to renege on its promises. Republicans hoped, at\nthe time, that the boom would last at least a session or two more--long enough\nfor them to sweep to victory in 2020, which they hoped to do in order to draw\nGOP-friendly new districts for themselves and hold on to power for another\ndecade. But the good times lasted less than a year beyond the 2019 session.\nToday the school finance bill looks irrelevant; it seems doubtful the\nLegislature will have enough money to fund it. The handcuffs on local\ngovernment funding, however, will remain in force.\n\nEven before this mess, the 2020 election was set to be unusually high stakes,\nand the 2021 Legislature unusually volatile. Texas Democrats looked to have a\nchance to take control of the Texas House, which was important, because next\nyear lawmakers will redraw congressional and legislative districts. But\nredisricting maybe postponed, thanks to the disruption COVID-19 has inflicted\non the collection of census data.\n\nNow the redistricting fight looks as distant and moot as the Legislature's\nschool finance bill. The recession driven by the oil bust and COVID-19 is\neverything: the economic calamity we are experiencing will blow a hole in the\nstate's budget, at the very moment lawmakers will need to act to protect\nsuffering Texans. We won't know for a while how battered the budget will be.\nMuch will depend on the price of oil in the coming months and how fast the\nunemployed are able to get back to work.\n\nFederal aid would help, but it's hard to imagine that states will be made\nwhole, given the vast needs. Cities and counties will need backstopping, too,\nthanks to the sharp decline in sales tax revenue. Budget writers will almost\ncertainly have to consider tapping the state's $10 billion Rainy Day Fund.\n\nIfs just as difficult to guess how the crash might affect the election--and\nTexas Democrats' chance of taking the statehouse. But let's say the Democrats\nsecure a slim majority in the House: if the session is going to be the pain\nparty many expect it to be, it might be helpful to Republicans in the long\nterm if Democrats are in control of the lower body. That way, whatever\nunpopular steps the Legislature takes will have the imprimatur of\nbipartisanship. Both sides can share the blame.\n\nIf that sounds strange, here's something stranger: for the state to recover,\noil prices need to rise and the public needs to return, en masse, to bars and\nrestaurants and retail shops. That isn't happening until the threat of the\nvirus is ended--or at least, greatly mitigated. The only part of the\ngovernment with the resources to make that happen (for example, through\nwidespread testing) and to keep Texans spending during the shutdown (through\nunemployment benefits and other emergency aid) are the federales. After years\nof fedbashing, Texas is beingforced to publicly put the whole of its weight\nonto the broad shoulders of big government--lest the Miracle slip away.\n\nCaption: Seated, right to left: House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, Governor Greg\nAbbott, and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick joined Pancake, the governor's\ndog, and other leaders at a press conference to announce school finance\nreforms on May 23, 2019.",

    "title": "Going for Broke: With a virus-infected economy and an oil bust to boot, the \"Texas Miracle\" is facing an unprecedented crisis.(NEWS & POLITICS: ANALYSIS)",
    "html": "<p>On an average day in 2019, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0838864447\">Texas Workforce Commission</org> received\nabout 13,000 calls from Texans applying for unemployment benefits.\nToward the end of the year the state unemployment rate hovered under 4\npercent: it had not risen much higher than 8 percent in three decades.\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> almost effortlessly added jobs month to month, amid a rapidly\nexpanding economy driven by population growth and a long-running energy\nboom that attracted vast sums of capital. Life was very, very good.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of March this year, the commission was receiving, on\naverage, 1.5 million calls a day. The state's economy had collapsed\nalmost overnight. The service industry and its millions of jobs in\nnow-empty restaurants and hotels and retail shops evaporated thanks to\nCOVID-19. The energy boom had busted, with the price of a barrel of oil\nwell below what many industry players needed to survive. Desperate\nsupplicants called the <org>Workforce Commission</org> hotline hundreds of times a\nday in the hope of reaching someone who could help them pay rent or\nafford groceries, mostly without success. To stem the tide, the\ncommission unveiled a rudimentary chatbot, named Larry, to answer basic\nquestions. Applicants did not love Larry, who unhelpfully told them to\ncall the commission.</p>\n\n<p>When <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> comptroller <person>Glenn Hegar</person> warned that the state could soon\nsee a double-digit unemployment rate, it was barely news. But the\nprojection served to put state government on notice: the deluge will not\nbe abating soon. The twin shocks of the virus and the oil glut, which\ntogether constitute the greatest economic calamity <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> has faced in a\nhalf century or more, threaten to stretch the state's\ninstitutions--and perhaps its politics--to the breaking point. Never\nbefore has the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> way of doing things faced a harsher test.</p>\n\n<p>Since the turn of the century, there has been an ongoing debate\nabout the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> model, sometimes referred to as the \"Texas\nMiracle,\" the regulatory and political system that greases the\nwheels of growth in the state. Proponents of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> model point with\ngreat pride to an indisputable fact: the state escaped some of the most\nsevere shocks of the Great Recession of 2007-2009, and job growth here\nhas outperformed that of many other states in the years following. Why?</p>\n\n<p>Predictably perhaps, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> leaders emphasized the wisdom of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>\nleaders--in maintaining the state's low taxes, light regulations,\nand small-government philosophy. Critics, including the liberal\neconomist <person>Paul Krugman</person>, countered that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas's</location> tax burden,\nregulatory framework, and government spending were in fact not\nparticularly small, and argued that the state's oil boom,\npermissive land-use policies, and low cost of living were largely\nresponsible.</p>\n\n<p>Politicians benefited from a quirk of the economy: the service\nindustry and the energy sector tended to run on different clocks. When\nthe service economy took a devastating hit during the 2008 financial\ncrash, amid foreclosures and falling incomes, state budget writers were\nhelped along, for a while, by oil prices, which ballooned to <money>$147</money> a\nbarrel in July of that year. And when prices collapsed in 2014 and 2015\nto less than <money>$40</money> a barrel, the blow to state finances was cushioned by\nthe strength of the rest of the economy. Now, like Thelma and Louise,\nthe two pillars of the long boom years have joined hands and sped off a\ncliff.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> will recover in some fashion, and maybe, with luck and wise\nleadership, the boom will resume. In the meantime, the state will be\nsubjected to a kind of stress test. Is there really anything special\nabout <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas's</location> economic engine that can't be explained by\nhealthy oil prices and a population explosion driven by cheap housing?\nDo business-friendly policies and the lack of a state income tax really\ngoose the state's economic performance? And how will our current\ngeneration of political leaders and institutions, who've grown\naccustomed to the good times, perform in a crunch? We're about to\nfind out.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> is a big state with big opportunities and big problems, even\nin the best of times. But for the last several decades, it's been a\ncomparatively easy place to govern. <org>The Texas Legislature</org>, unlike its\nunlucky counterparts in states with stagnant tax bases and aging\ninfrastructure, enters most sessions eating high on the hog. Cut taxes,\nor boost spending? ?Porque no los dos?</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, there have been tough budgets in the recent past. In\nthe 2011 session, the Legislature cut <money>$5.4 billion</money> from public education\nfunding. (As it turns out, the damage to schools was unnecessary.) But\nin general, lawmakers have plenty of wiggle room in their budgets. The\ncomptroller's revenue projections often have been lowballed, so\nlawmakers start their every-other-year legislative sessions with a bit\nof a surplus, allowing them to write the state's two-year budget\nwith bumper rails.</p>\n\n<p>But the Lege also writes its budgets with a kind of boom mentality,\nwhich leaves state agencies less resilient and less ready for bad times.\nFor example: lawmakers deliberately underfund the Texas Medicaid\nprogram, planning to fill it in with \"extra\" money during the\nnext session. That kind of borrowing from the future to pay for the past\nonly works in good times.</p>\n\n<p>Another example, and one that is becoming more critical by the day,\nis the state's unemployment trust fund, which the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0838864447\">Texas Workforce\nCommission</org> uses to pay out claims to the people now swamping its call\ncenters. <org>The Wallstreet Journal</org> reported in March that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> was one of\njust six states with trust funds that would likely be exhausted after\nsix months. In late April, analysts at the nonprofit <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1517384332\">Tax Foundation</org>\nestimated that the state could only afford the payouts for a couple more\nweeks.</p>\n\n<p>Later that month, the <org>Workforce Commission</org> asked the <org>U.S. Labor\nDepartment</org> for a loan to bolster the fund, which may have to be repaid\nby raising employment taxes on businesses. Given the number of\nunemployed persons in need, the tax hikes could be significant. That, of\ncourse, would be bad for the recovery. <org>The Legislature</org> has shortchanged\nthe trust fund during times of fiscal health, precisely when it would\nhave been easiest to fortify it, and that decision could lead to a lot\nof unnecessary pain. The tide is going out, and the TWC probably\nwon't be the only boat stranded on the shore.</p>\n\n<p>Here's another example of the boom mentality. In the 2019\nlegislative session, you may recall, the big-ticket item was a\nphotogenic bill reforming the school finance system. It was part of a\nsprawling package that capped the amount of taxes that local governments\nand schools can collect while simultaneously putting an additional <money>$6.5\nbillion</money> into public education. State lawmakers were extremely proud of\nthis twofer of property tax relief and more money for schools. They\nconvened a lot of back slapping press conferences. They took pictures\nwith a golden retriever.</p>\n\n<p>But there was one little problem: they didn't attach a\nspecific funding source to the legislation. So the bill only did what it\nwas supposed to do as long as money was still coming in hand over fist.\nIf there was a crash, the Legislature might be forced to renege on its\npromises. <org>Republicans</org> hoped, at the time, that the boom would last at\nleast a session or two more--long enough for them to sweep to victory in\n2020, which they hoped to do in order to draw <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3974939109\">GOP</org>-friendly new districts\nfor themselves and hold on to power for another decade. But the good\ntimes lasted less than a year beyond the 2019 session. Today the school\nfinance bill looks irrelevant; it seems doubtful the Legislature will\nhave enough money to fund it. The handcuffs on local government funding,\nhowever, will remain in force.</p>\n\n<p>Even before this mess, the 2020 election was set to be unusually\nhigh stakes, and the 2021 Legislature unusually volatile. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>\n<org>Democrats</org> looked to have a chance to take control of the <org>Texas House</org>,\nwhich was important, because next year lawmakers will redraw\ncongressional and legislative districts. But redisricting maybe\npostponed, thanks to the disruption COVID-19 has inflicted on the\ncollection of census data.</p>\n\n<p>Now the redistricting fight looks as distant and moot as the\nLegislature's school finance bill. The recession driven by the oil\nbust and COVID-19 is everything: the economic calamity we are\nexperiencing will blow a hole in the state's budget, at the very\nmoment lawmakers will need to act to protect suffering Texans. We\nwon't know for a while how battered the budget will be. Much will\ndepend on the price of oil in the coming months and how fast the\nunemployed are able to get back to work.</p>\n\n<p>Federal aid would help, but it's hard to imagine that states\nwill be made whole, given the vast needs. Cities and counties will need\nbackstopping, too, thanks to the sharp decline in sales tax revenue.\nBudget writers will almost certainly have to consider tapping the\nstate's <money>$10 billion</money> <org>Rainy Day Fund</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Ifs just as difficult to guess how the crash might affect the\nelection--and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> Democrats' chance of taking the statehouse. But\nlet's say the <org>Democrats</org> secure a slim majority in the House: if the\nsession is going to be the pain party many expect it to be, it might be\nhelpful to <org>Republicans</org> in the long term if <org>Democrats</org> are in control of\nthe lower body. That way, whatever unpopular steps the Legislature takes\nwill have the imprimatur of bipartisanship. Both sides can share the\nblame.</p>\n\n<p>If that sounds strange, here's something stranger: for the\nstate to recover, oil prices need to rise and the public needs to\nreturn, en masse, to bars and restaurants and retail shops. That\nisn't happening until the threat of the virus is ended--or at\nleast, greatly mitigated. The only part of the government with the\nresources to make that happen (for example, through widespread testing)\nand to keep Texans spending during the shutdown (through unemployment\nbenefits and other emergency aid) are the federales. After years of\nfedbashing, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> is beingforced to publicly put the whole of its weight\nonto the broad shoulders of big government--lest the Miracle slip away.</p>\n\n<p>Caption: Seated, right to left: House Speaker <person>Dennis Bonnen</person>,\nGovernor <person>Greg Abbott</person>, and Lieutenant Governor <person>Dan Patrick</person> joined\nPancake, the governor's dog, and other leaders at a press\nconference to announce school finance reforms on <chron>May 23, 2019</chron>.</p>",
