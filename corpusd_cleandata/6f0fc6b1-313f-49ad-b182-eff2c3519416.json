    "text": "The February wind held a chill but the sun felt warm enough to melt ricotta as\nGiovanni and I drove through the winding roads up from the Ionian coast on a\nbeautiful day in Calabria, at the toe of Italy's boot.\n\nGiovanni, a 30-year-old pub owner, was my student where I was teaching English\nin Reggio at the time. On free days, he taught me about life in southern\nItaly. That day, we'd gone in search of a village called Galliciano, but when\nwe found a road sign, it was written in Greek.\n\nThe rugged terrain seemed best suited for goats and the tenacious oaks,\nolives, and some almond trees exploding with white blossoms. But oranges and\nlemons glowed brightly in the sun. The small village clung to the slope,\nredolent with bergamot-the lemon-like fruit unique to Calabria that gives Earl\nGrey tea its essence.\n\nThe road narrowed to walks among a cluster of white and gray hovels with\nredtiled roofs. Abandoning the car, we stepped through a minefield of goat\ndroppings. Reggio seemed a million miles away as I stood listening to\nwhispering breezes that carried the clanging of tin bells and bleats of goats\ndown from the slopes.\n\n\"Welcome to Magna Grecia,\" Giovanni said.\n\nMore than 2,700 years ago, southern Italy had yet to see the Romans. The\nGreeks occupied the shores of Calabria and Eastern Sicily forming Magna\nGrecia, or Great Greece. Here the poet Theocritus and mathematician and\ninventor Archimedes walked the earth, and it remained part of the Greek Empire\nuntil the Romans annexed it in the third century B.C.\n\nThe Romans tolerated the Greeks, folding them into the empire, and even\ntreating Greek as a second language in Rome with its sizable Greek minority\ninto the Christian era. In Reggio, I'd met the late Franco Mosino, a professor\nwho contended that it was in fact these Western Greeks who developed the Greek\nalphabet and wrote \"The Odyssey.\" Many geographical names in the area are\nprominent figures in the tale: the monster Scylla is now the town of Scilla\noverlooking the Strait of Messina, and Aeolus, keeper of the winds, gave his\nname to the Aeolian Islands just north of Sicily.\n\nAn old man sat on a bench along a whitewashed wall sorting a burlap sack full\nof tiny olives in the sun. We hailed him but I didn't understand his Italian\nreply.\n\n\"Calabrese dialect,\" Giovanni explained.\n\nGiovanni asked him some questions. The man didn't smile but raised himself up\nwith some pride and spoke. Giovanni's face brightened. \"Greek!\" he cried.\n\nLike curious children who come across a foreigner, we rambled through a list\nof words. \"How do you say 'water'?\"\n\n\"Nero,\" he said.\n\nThrough Giovanni, I asked him about the local youth: What do they do? What do\nthey like? Do they know Greek?\n\nHe said \"nenti\" a lot (\"nothing\" in dialect) and shook his head slowly the way\na tired old man does. His fingers looked bruised from the purple olives he\nsorted, in stark contrast to his bright white mustache and wiry hair spilling\nfrom under a wool driving cap. His tanned face showed wrinkles deep and smooth\nas if even they had been worn by the years.\n\n\"There is no work here for the young people.\" He pointed to a flawlessly\nconstructed stone embankment that supported the next level of houses. \"I built\nthat wall. Forty years ago.\" Houses shared walls with the neighbors or were\nseparated by a small garden with perhaps a goat or two staring out through a\ngate. In the center of town stood a simple church with a Greek placard out\nfront that translated as \"The Street of La Signora of Greece.\"\n\nFewer than 400 people lived in the village and surrounding hillside houses,\nand not all of them spoke Greek. The older residents communicated in Greek at\nhome, but the children possessed only scraps of it. \"There used to be three\nteachers here, elementary teachers. There used to be a doctor. Now there's\nnothing. The young people don't want to learn anything. The only thing they\nwant to learn is to drive,\" the old man told us.\n\nMany of the elderly in all of Calabria are bilingual, choosing the regional\ndialect over pure Italian at home. So has Greek in these tiny pockets evolved\nand survived. The Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire came in the sixth century,\ninfusing the old with the neo-Hellenic language of Athens and leaving the name\nCalabria. Tema tis Calavrias was the western outpost of that empire. This\npeculiar regional dialect has become known as Greko in Calabria (Griko in\nSalento, Italy's boot heel), an amalgam of ancient Doric Greek dialect,\nByzantineera Greek, and Italian. It survives primarily through an oral\ntradition, though some writing still exists, and in recent years, local\nwriters have created original works in it.\n\nAn organization based in Reggio and nearby Greek town Bova, Apodiafazzi-\nmeaning \"the light before the dawn\"-has helped bring Greco-Calabrian culture\nto light. When I visited in 2003, they counted 5,000 Greko speakers in\nCalabria, which is home to nine Greek-origin towns. A minority-rights\norganization has that number at 12,000 today, and a 1999 Italian law grants\ncertain protections to this endangered language and culture.\n\nBack in Reggio, I met with Dr. Carmelo Giuseppe Nucera, the president of\nApodiafazzi at that time. \"Most people don't know or don't believe it, but\nmany of us are descended from the Greeks. Look at the surnames. Thirty percent\nof them are Greek in origin.\" He looked up at the ceiling as he thought of\nsome examples. \"'Crea.' It means 'meat.' 'Romeo.' It means 'from\nConstantinople.' 'Chila,' 'man with fat lips.' 'Chardia,' 'heart.' ... Even\nthe former mayor's name, 'Falcomata' meant 'calderaio,' coppersmith.So you\nsee? It's not just a few speakers in some villages.\"\n\nAt that time, his organization was preparing to send a group of singers to the\n2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.\n\n\"What most people don't realize is that the Greeks here were renowned\nchampions when the Olympics first began,\" he said. He drew out a photo of two\nancient coins. \"You see these? They are in commemoration of an Olympic\nvictory. Anassila di Reggio, the 'tyrant' of Reggio in 480 B.C., was a\nchampion racer.\" The coins featured a man in a cart pulled by mules.\n\nThe Museo Nazionale in Reggio has many artifacts from the days of Magna\nGrecia, including two rare bronze statues, \"Bronzi di Riace,\" found in waters\nnearby. Two of only four in the world, they are arguably the finest examples\nof Greek sculpture. But the only way to see them now is to visit the last\nvestiges of Magna Grecia in southern Italy.\n\nKevin Revolinski is an avid traveler and the author of15 books, includingThe\nYogurt Man Cometh: Tales of an American Teacher in Turkey\" and several outdoor\nand brewery guidebooks.

On free days, he taught me about life in southern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location>. That day, we'd gone in search of a village called Galliciano, but when we found a road sign, it was written in Greek.</p>\n<p>The rugged terrain seemed best suited for goats and the tenacious oaks, olives, and some almond trees exploding with white blossoms. But oranges and lemons glowed brightly in the sun. The small village clung to the slope, redolent with bergamot-the lemon-like fruit unique to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.ca\">Calabria</location> that gives <person>Earl Grey</person> tea its essence.</p>\n<p>The road narrowed to walks among a cluster of white and gray hovels with redtiled roofs. Abandoning the car, we stepped through a minefield of goat droppings. Reggio seemed a million miles away as I stood listening to whispering breezes that carried the clanging of tin bells and bleats of goats down from the slopes.</p>\n<p>\"Welcome to <person>Magna Grecia</person>,\" Giovanni said.</p>\n<p>More than 2,700 years ago, southern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location> had yet to see the Romans. The Greeks occupied the shores of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.ca\">Calabria</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.sc\">Eastern Sicily</location> forming <person>Magna Grecia</person>, or Great Greece. Here the poet Theocritus and mathematician and inventor Archimedes walked the earth, and it remained part of the Greek Empire until the Romans annexed it in the third century B.C.</p>\n<p>The Romans tolerated the Greeks, folding them into the empire, and even treating Greek as a second language in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/it..rome\">Rome</location> with its sizable Greek minority into the Christian era. In Reggio, I'd met the late <person>Franco Mosino</person>, a professor who contended that it was in fact these Western Greeks who developed the Greek alphabet and wrote \"The Odyssey.\" Many geographical names in the area are prominent figures in the tale: the monster Scylla is now the town of Scilla overlooking the <location>Strait of Messina</location>, and Aeolus, keeper of the winds, gave his name to the Aeolian Islands just north of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.sc\">Sicily</location>.</p>\n<p>An old man sat on a bench along a whitewashed wall sorting a burlap sack full of tiny olives in the sun. We hailed him but I didn't understand his Italian reply.</p>\n<p>\"Calabrese dialect,\" Giovanni explained.</p>\n<p>Giovanni asked him some questions. The man didn't smile but raised himself up with some pride and spoke. Giovanni's face brightened. \"Greek!\" he cried.</p>\n<p>Like curious children who come across a foreigner, we rambled through a list of words. \"How do you say 'water'?\"</p>\n<p>\"Nero,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Through Giovanni, I asked him about the local youth: What do they do? What do they like? Do they know Greek?</p>\n<p>He said \"nenti\" a lot (\"nothing\" in dialect) and shook his head slowly the way a tired old man does. His fingers looked bruised from the purple olives he sorted, in stark contrast to his bright white mustache and wiry hair spilling from under a wool driving cap. His tanned face showed wrinkles deep and smooth as if even they had been worn by the years.</p>\n<p>\"There is no work here for the young people.\" He pointed to a flawlessly constructed stone embankment that supported the next level of houses. \"I built that wall. Forty years ago.\" Houses shared walls with the neighbors or were separated by a small garden with perhaps a goat or two staring out through a gate. In the center of town stood a simple church with a Greek placard out front that translated as \"The Street of La Signora of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gr\">Greece</location>.\"</p>\n<p>Fewer than 400 people lived in the village and surrounding hillside houses, and not all of them spoke Greek. The older residents communicated in Greek at home, but the children possessed only scraps of it. \"There used to be three teachers here, elementary teachers. There used to be a doctor. Now there's nothing. The young people don't want to learn anything. The only thing they want to learn is to drive,\" the old man told us.</p>\n<p>Many of the elderly in all of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.ca\">Calabria</location> are bilingual, choosing the regional dialect over pure Italian at home. So has Greek in these tiny pockets evolved and survived. The Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire came in the sixth century, infusing the old with the neo-Hellenic language of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gr..athens\">Athens</location> and leaving the name <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.ca\">Calabria</location>. Tema tis Calavrias was the western outpost of that empire. This peculiar regional dialect has become known as Greko in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.ca\">Calabria</location> (Griko in Salento, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy's</location> boot heel), an amalgam of ancient Doric Greek dialect, Byzantineera Greek, and Italian. It survives primarily through an oral tradition, though some writing still exists, and in recent years, local writers have created original works in it.</p>\n<p>An organization based in Reggio and nearby Greek town Bova, Apodiafazzi- meaning \"the light before the dawn\"-has helped bring Greco-Calabrian culture to light. When I visited in 2003, they counted 5,000 Greko speakers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.ca\">Calabria</location>, which is home to nine Greek-origin towns. A minority-rights organization has that number at 12,000 today, and a 1999 Italian law grants certain protections to this endangered language and culture.</p>\n<p>Back in Reggio, I met with Dr. <person>Carmelo Giuseppe Nucera</person>, the president of Apodiafazzi at that time. \"Most people don't know or don't believe it, but many of us are descended from the Greeks. Look at the surnames. Thirty percent of them are Greek in origin.\" He looked up at the ceiling as he thought of some examples. \"'Crea.' It means 'meat.' 'Romeo.' It means 'from Constantinople.' 'Chila,' 'man with fat lips.' 'Chardia,' 'heart.' ... Even the former mayor's name, 'Falcomata' meant 'calderaio,' coppersmith.So you see? It's not just a few speakers in some villages.\"</p>\n<p>At that time, his organization was preparing to send a group of singers to the 2004 <org>Summer Olympics</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gr..athens\">Athens</location>.</p>\n<p>\"What most people don't realize is that the Greeks here were renowned champions when the <org>Olympics</org> first began,\" he said. He drew out a photo of two ancient coins. \"You see these? They are in commemoration of an Olympic victory. Anassila di Reggio, the 'tyrant' of Reggio in <chron>480 B.C.</chron>, was a champion racer.\" The coins featured a man in a cart pulled by mules.</p>\n<p>The Museo Nazionale in Reggio has many artifacts from the days of <person>Magna Grecia</person>, including two rare bronze statues, \"Bronzi di Riace,\" found in waters nearby. Two of only four in the world, they are arguably the finest examples of Greek sculpture. But the only way to see them now is to visit the last vestiges of <person>Magna Grecia</person> in southern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location>.</p>\n<p><person>Kevin Revolinski</person> is an avid traveler and the author of15 books, includingThe Yogurt Man Cometh: Tales of an American Teacher in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tr\">Turkey</location>\" and several outdoor and brewery guidebooks.
