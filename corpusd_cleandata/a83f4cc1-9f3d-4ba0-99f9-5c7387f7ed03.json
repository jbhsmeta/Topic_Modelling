    "text": "Contrary to the Trump administration's peace plan with the Taliban, al-Qaida\nis more embedded in the Afghan Taliban than ever. The Taliban have not\nrenounced their alliance with al-Qaida. The maintenance of the alliance also\nraises disturbing questions about Pakistan's role in sponsoring the Taliban\nwar against the United States and NATO.\n\nThe United States and its allies intervened in Afghanistan 19 years ago\nbecause the Taliban, led by Mullah Omar, would not hand over Osama bin Laden\nto face justice for the 9/11 attacks. Al-Qaida was a state within the state of\nAfghanistan, with its own license plates and airport entrances, as well as\ncontrol of numerous camps and training bases.\n\nUnder the so-called peace agreement signed with the Taliban by the Trump\nadministration (but not by the government in Kabul), the Taliban is supposed\nto guarantee that the territory it controls is not used for international\nterrorism against the U.S. and its allies. To do so, presumably the Taliban\nwould shut down the al-Qaida infrastructure in their territory.\n\nThe United Nations issued a report this month on the state of the Taliban and\ntheir relationship with al-Qaida. The U.N. monitors who prepared the report\nhave a well-deserved reputation for excellent scholarship on the war and the\nTaliban.\n\nThey report that \"al-Qaida has been operating covertly in Afghanistan while\nstill maintaining close relations with the Taliban.\" Indeed al-Qaida is\n\"quietly gaining strength in Afghanistan while continuing to operate with the\nTaliban under their protection.\" The terrorist group is active in 12 Afghan\nprovinces, mostly along the border with Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the U.N., the senior leadership of al-Qaida and the Taliban meet\nregularly. The U.N. is aware of at least six such meetings in the last year.\nOne included Hamza bin Laden before his death. The Emir of al-Qaida, Ayman al-\nZawahri met with senior leaders of the Taliban from the Haqqani network in\nFebruary, a very rare report of the most-wanted man in the world holding an\naudience, apparently in Pakistan.\n\nA joint U.S.-Afghan military operation last September killed the leader of al-\nQaida's India cell and its courier to Zawahri in Helmand province. They were\nbeing sheltered by the Taliban, which also lost fighters killed in the\noperation.\n\nThe U.N. estimates that al-Qaida has around 500 armed operatives in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan. There are \"deep personal ties (including through\nmarriage)\" between the two groups that date back decades. The reports bottom\nline is that the \"Taliban appear to have strengthened their relationship with\nal-Qaida rather than the opposite.\" The notion of a break in their\nrelationship is \"mere fiction,\" in the words of one U.N. member state.\n\nOther terrorist groups are also embedded with the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nLashkar e Taibi and Jaish Muhammad are two Pakistan-based groups that target\nIndia. They have over 1,000 fighters in Afghanistan, co-located with the\nTaliban. Both have long-standing ties to the Pakistani intelligence service,\nthe Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Central Asian and Uighur terror groups\nare also present with the Taliban.\n\nThe U.N. report does not address Pakistan's own role with the Taliban.\nPakistan has been the Taliban's base and sanctuary since 2001 and was its key\nsupporter before 9/11. It has never broken ties. Mullah Omar passed away in\nPakistan. The groups senior leadership are based in Quetta. The Haqqani\nnetwork is especially close to the ISI.\n\nThe report does say the Taliban have no problems \"with respect to recruitment,\nfunding, weapons or ammunition,\" an implicit indication of the extent of\nPakistani support. They also fund raise in the Gulf states. Omar's successor\nwas a frequent visitor to Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. The Taliban is also deeply\ninvolved in drug trafficking.\n\nA decade ago, I prepared a report for the new Obama-Biden administration on\nAfghanistan and Pakistan. The U.N. report is hauntingly familiar in its\nconclusions. The good news is that al-Qaida has been severely degraded in the\nlast 10 years. Osama bin Laden was brought to justice hiding in Abbottabad,\nthe home of Pakistan's military academy. The bad news is the Taliban is still\nin bed with al-Qaida, and Pakistan is still the Taliban's sponsor.\n\nThe question is: Will the Trump administration ignore the facts about the\nTaliban and al-Qaida and proceed with the withdrawal of American troops and\nother personnel from Afghanistan, as outlined in the plan signed with the\nTaliban? Instead, it should re-evaluate the engagement with the Taliban,\nperhaps suspending it until they take action to address the al-Qaida threat.\nThe next administration will need to do a thorough review of policy fully\nengaging with the Kabul government.",

The <org>Taliban</org> have not renounced their alliance with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org>. The maintenance of the alliance also raises disturbing questions about Pakistan&#8217;s role in sponsoring the <org>Taliban</org> war against <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> and <org>NATO</org>.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">The United States</location> and its allies intervened in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location> 19 years ago because the <org>Taliban</org>, led by Mullah Omar, would not hand over <person>Osama bin Laden</person> to face justice for the 9/11 attacks. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">Al-Qaida</org> was a state within the state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location>, with its own license plates and airport entrances, as well as control of numerous camps and training bases.</p>\n<p>Under the so-called peace agreement signed with the <org>Taliban</org> by the Trump administration (but not by the government in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/af..kabul\">Kabul</location>), the <org>Taliban</org> is supposed to guarantee that the territory it controls is not used for international terrorism against the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and its allies. To do so, presumably the <org>Taliban</org> would shut down the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> infrastructure in their territory.</p>\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">United Nations</org> issued a report this month on the state of the <org>Taliban</org> and their relationship with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org>. The U.N. monitors who prepared the report have a well-deserved reputation for excellent scholarship on the war and the <org>Taliban</org>.</p>\n<p>They report that &#8220;al-Qaida has been operating covertly in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location> while still maintaining close relations with the Taliban.&#8221; Indeed al-Qaida is &#8220;quietly gaining strength in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location> while continuing to operate with the <org>Taliban</org> under their protection.&#8221; The terrorist group is active in 12 Afghan provinces, mostly along the border with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>.</p>\n<p>According to the U.N., the senior leadership of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> and the <org>Taliban</org> meet regularly. The U.N. is aware of at least six such meetings in the last year. One included <person>Hamza bin Laden</person> before his death. The Emir of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org>, <person>Ayman al-Zawahri</person> met with senior leaders of the <org>Taliban</org> from the <org>Haqqani</org> network in February, a very rare report of the most-wanted man in the world holding an audience, apparently in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>.</p>\n<p>A joint <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>-Afghan military operation last September killed the leader of al-Qaida&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> cell and its courier to Zawahri in Helmand province. They were being sheltered by the <org>Taliban</org>, which also lost fighters killed in the operation.</p>\n<p>The U.N. estimates that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> has around 500 armed operatives in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>. There are &#8220;deep personal ties (including through marriage)&#8221; between the two groups that date back decades. The reports bottom line is that the &#8220;Taliban appear to have strengthened their relationship with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> rather than the opposite.&#8221; The notion of a break in their relationship is &#8220;mere fiction,&#8221; in the words of one U.N. member state.</p>\n<p>Other terrorist groups are also embedded with the <org>Taliban</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location>. Lashkar e Taibi and <person>Jaish Muhammad</person> are two <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>-based groups that target <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>. They have over 1,000 fighters in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location>, co-located with the <org>Taliban</org>. Both have long-standing ties to the Pakistani intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Central Asian and Uighur terror groups are also present with the <org>Taliban</org>.</p>\n<p>The U.N. report does not address Pakistan&#8217;s own role with the <org>Taliban</org>. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location> has been the Taliban&#8217;s base and sanctuary since 2001 and was its key supporter before 9/11. It has never broken ties. Mullah Omar passed away in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>. The groups senior leadership are based in Quetta. The <org>Haqqani</org> network is especially close to the ISI.</p>\n<p>The report does say the <org>Taliban</org> have no problems &#8220;with respect to recruitment, funding, weapons or ammunition,&#8221; an implicit indication of the extent of Pakistani support. They also fund raise in the Gulf states. Omar&#8217;s successor was a frequent visitor to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ae..abudha\">Abu Dhabi</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/bh\">Bahrain</location>. The <org>Taliban</org> is also deeply involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, I prepared a report for the new Obama-Biden administration on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location>. The U.N. report is hauntingly familiar in its conclusions. The good news is that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> has been severely degraded in the last 10 years. <person>Osama bin Laden</person> was brought to justice hiding in Abbottabad, the home of Pakistan&#8217;s military academy. The bad news is the <org>Taliban</org> is still in bed with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pk\">Pakistan</location> is still the Taliban&#8217;s sponsor.</p>\n<p>The question is: Will the Trump administration ignore the facts about the <org>Taliban</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> and proceed with the withdrawal of American troops and other personnel from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/af\">Afghanistan</location>, as outlined in the plan signed with the <org>Taliban</org>? Instead, it should re-evaluate the engagement with the <org>Taliban</org>, perhaps suspending it until they take action to address the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000036136\">al-Qaida</org> threat. The next administration will need to do a thorough review of policy fully engaging with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/af..kabul\">Kabul</location> government.</p>",
