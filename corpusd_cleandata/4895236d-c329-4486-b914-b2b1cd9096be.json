    "text": "The Cavaliers expressed disappointment over the end of their season and their\nunrequited desire to be part of the NBA's restart plan, which was approved by\nthe league's Board of Governors on Thursday.\n\nThe Cavs issued a statement even before the NBA Players Association signed off\non the 22-team format, expected in a conference call scheduled for Friday,\naccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe Cavs (19-46), last in the Eastern Conference, were among eight teams left\nout in the plan announced by the league to resume play on July 31. The NBA\nsuspended the season on March 11 after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested\npositive for the coronavirus.\n\nThirteen teams from the Western Conference and nine from the East will travel\nto the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida, on July 7, according to\nShams Charania of The Athletic. Eight \"seeding games\" will be held to\ndetermine the playoff field.\n\n\"While we are disappointed that the announced return to play proposal excludes\nthe Cleveland Cavaliers, we understand all of the unprecedented factors that\ncontributed to this outcome and we accept the hard decisions Commissioner Adam\nSilver and the NBA's Board of Governors had to make,\" Cavs General Manager\nKoby Altman and coach J.B. Bickerstaff said in a joint statement. \"We also\nrespect the exhaustive and life-altering measures that were considered as a\nresult of COVID-19, but as a team, we greatly desired to be a part of the\nseason's resumption.\n\n\"We were hopeful to be granted the opportunity to continue the 2019-20 season\nand join our counterparts in Orlando to further the development of our young\nteam in meaningful basketball games, and also feed off the positive momentum\nwe had built prior to the league shutdown on March 11. Collectively, our\nplayers want to compete at the highest level and we will unquestionably use\nthis as added motivation as we continue working towards a sustainable culture\nof winning.\"\n\nThe Cavs went 5-6 after Bickerstaff was promoted from associate head coach\nafter John Beilein and the team parted ways on Feb. 19.\n\nAll five victories came against teams invited to Orlando. That list includes\nthe Denver Nuggets (third in the West), Miami Heat (fourth in the East),\nPhiladelphia 76ers (sixth in the East), San Antonio Spurs (four games out of\nthe West's eight seed) and Washington Wizards (5\u00bd games out of eighth place in\nthe East).\n\nThe NBA said if the July 31 restart is not disrupted by the pandemic, the\ndraft lottery would be held on Aug. 25 and the NBA Draft on Oct. 15, three\ndays after a possible Game 7 of The Finals.\n\nThe league said the eight teams not returning to play and the six teams\nparticipating in the restart that do not qualify for the playoffs will be\nseeded in the lottery by their records on March 11. The 16 playoff teams will\ngo in inverse order of their combined records in regular-season games and the\nseeding games in Orlando.\n\nThe Cavs can select no lower than sixth in the draft and have a 14 percent\nchance of getting the No. 1 pick in the lottery.\n\nThe league said the 2020-21 regular season would likely begin on Dec. 1, with\nCharania reporting that training camp would start on Nov. 10. That would mean\nthe Cavs will go nearly nine months between games.\n\n\"Although the time away from our incredible fanbase in Cleveland and across\nNortheast Ohio is unfortunate, we look forward to finding ways to continue\nutilizing our platform and available resources to reach out in our community\nto help affect change and take sustainable action in the fight against racial\ninjustice,\" Altman and Bickerstaff said, in reference to the May 25 death of\nGeorge Floyd and the ensuing protests to end racism.\n\nThe Cavs also released an organizational statement that praised how the\n\"players, coaches and entire organization has faced this incredibly\nchallenging time.\"\n\n\"So much of what we've learned about our team and ourselves as an organization\nduring this journey, though, has nothing to do with basketball and everything\nto do with love, character, community and our culture,\" it said. \"All of which\nare things we will continue to amplify.\"\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Portland Trail Blazers were the lone\ndissenter in the Board of Governors' vote.\n\nCREDIT: MARLA RIDENOUR",

    "html": "<p> The Cavaliers expressed disappointment over the end of their season and their unrequited desire to be part of the NBA&#8217;s restart plan, which was approved by the league&#8217;s <org>Board of Governors</org> on Thursday. </p><p>The Cavs issued a statement even before the <org>NBA Players Association</org> signed off on the 22-team format, expected in a conference call scheduled for Friday, according to ESPN&#8217;s <person>Adrian Wojnarowski</person>. </p><p>The Cavs (19-46), last in the <org>Eastern Conference</org>, were among eight teams left out in the plan announced by the league to resume play on <chron>July 31</chron>. The NBA suspended the season on <chron>March 11</chron> after <person>Rudy Gobert</person> of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131380\">Utah Jazz</org> tested positive for the coronavirus. </p><p>Thirteen teams from the <org>Western Conference</org> and nine from the East will travel to the <org>Walt Disney World</org> resort in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando, Florida</location>, on <chron>July 7</chron>, according to <person>Shams Charania</person> of The Athletic. Eight &#8220;seeding games&#8221; will be held to determine the playoff field. </p><p>&#8220;While we are disappointed that the announced return to play proposal excludes the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131362\">Cleveland Cavaliers</org>, we understand all of the unprecedented factors that contributed to this outcome and we accept the hard decisions Commissioner <person>Adam Silver</person> and the NBA&#8217;s <org>Board of Governors</org> had to make,&#8221; Cavs General Manager <person>Koby Altman</person> and coach <person>J.B. Bickerstaff</person> said in a joint statement. &#8220;We also respect the exhaustive and life-altering measures that were considered as a result of COVID-19, but as a team, we greatly desired to be a part of the season&#8217;s resumption. </p><p>&#8220;We were hopeful to be granted the opportunity to continue the 2019-20 season and join our counterparts in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> to further the development of our young team in meaningful basketball games, and also feed off the positive momentum we had built prior to the league shutdown on <chron>March 11</chron>. Collectively, our players want to compete at the highest level and we will unquestionably use this as added motivation as we continue working towards a sustainable culture of winning.&#8221; </p><p>The Cavs went 5-6 after Bickerstaff was promoted from associate head coach after <person>John Beilein</person> and the team parted ways on <chron>Feb. 19</chron>. </p><p>All five victories came against teams invited to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location>. That list includes the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131395\">Denver Nuggets</org> (third in the West), <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131396\">Miami Heat</org> (fourth in the East), <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131403\">Philadelphia 76ers</org> (sixth in the East), <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131372\">San Antonio Spurs</org> (four games out of the West&#8217;s eight seed) and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131366\">Washington Wizards</org> (5&#189; games out of eighth place in the East). </p><p>The NBA said if the <chron>July 31</chron> restart is not disrupted by the pandemic, the draft lottery would be held on <chron>Aug. 25</chron> and the NBA Draft on <chron>Oct. 15</chron>, three days after a possible Game 7 of The Finals. </p><p>The league said the eight teams not returning to play and the six teams participating in the restart that do not qualify for the playoffs will be seeded in the lottery by their records on <chron>March 11</chron>. The 16 playoff teams will go in inverse order of their combined records in regular-season games and the seeding games in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location>. </p><p>The Cavs can select no lower than sixth in the draft and have a 14 percent chance of getting the No. 1 pick in the lottery. </p><p>The league said the 2020-21 regular season would likely begin on <chron>Dec. 1</chron>, with Charania reporting that training camp would start on <chron>Nov. 10</chron>. That would mean the Cavs will go nearly nine months between games. </p><p>&#8220;Although the time away from our incredible fanbase in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">Cleveland</location> and across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Northeast Ohio</location> is unfortunate, we look forward to finding ways to continue utilizing our platform and available resources to reach out in our community to help affect change and take sustainable action in the fight against racial injustice,&#8221; Altman and Bickerstaff said, in reference to the <chron>May 25</chron> death of <person>George Floyd</person> and the ensuing protests to end racism. </p><p>The Cavs also released an organizational statement that praised how the &#8220;players, coaches and entire organization has faced this incredibly challenging time.&#8221; </p><p>&#8220;So much of what we&#8217;ve learned about our team and ourselves as an organization during this journey, though, has nothing to do with basketball and everything to do with love, character, community and our culture,&#8221; it said. &#8220;All of which are things we will continue to amplify.&#8221; </p><p>According to multiple reports, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131363\">Portland Trail Blazers</org> were the lone dissenter in the Board of Governors&#8217; vote. </p><p>CREDIT: <person>MARLA RIDENOUR</person></p>",
