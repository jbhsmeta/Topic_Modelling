However, he dismissed\nthe notion that such support would equate to a subsidy for the industry,\nadding that similar programs are in place for manufacturing and other\nsectors.Mr. McMillan says, \"We hear from coast to coast -- from the offshore\nof Newfoundland to the investments that we'd like to see in Western Canada \\--\nthat it would be a key thing the government could do to level the playing\nfield and to be consistent with other industries within Canada.\"CAPP also\nwants Ottawa to display a visible show of support for the industry in an\neffort to woo international investment here, and create a panel made up of\nsenior industry representatives and government departments to work on a\nrecovery strategy.",

However, he dismissed the notion that such support would equate to a subsidy for the industry, adding that similar programs are in place for manufacturing and other sectors.<person>Mr. McMillan</person> says, \"We hear from coast to coast -- from the offshore of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/ca.nl\">Newfoundland</location> to the investments that we'd like to see in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Western Canada</location> -- that it would be a key thing the government could do to level the playing field and to be consistent with other industries within <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>.\"CAPP also wants <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.ottawa\">Ottawa</location> to display a visible show of support for the industry in an effort to woo international investment here, and create a panel made up of senior industry representatives and government departments to work on a recovery strategy.</p>\n<p />",
