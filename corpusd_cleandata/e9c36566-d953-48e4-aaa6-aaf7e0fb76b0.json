    "text": "5 years ago\n\nDevotees of Hinduism from across Britain and the rest of the world are to\nconverge on Edinburgh for a notable date in the faith's history. Sunday will\nsee the official opening of the capital's first temple and cultural centre in\nSt Andrew Place in Leith with a colourful pageant of dancers and traditionally\ndressed followers. Hundreds of people are attending Edinburgh Mandir Mahotsav\n2015. This weekend's events will culminate in a blessing of the renovated\nbuilding by invited Sadhus, scholars and priests.\n\n10 years ago\n\nThe leader of Scotland's Catholics called for a \"resurrection in the life of\nthe church\" as he joined senior archbishops in making a series of apologies\nover the sex abuse scandal. In his Easter Sunday homily at St Mary's Cathedral\nin Edinburgh, Cardinal Keith O'Brien described how the scandal had caused\n\"great hatred\" to be directed at innocent priests and had left ordinary\nCatholics feeling \"demoralised and confused\" by the \"many evils\" perpetrated\nby paedophile priests.\n\n25 years ago\n\nA man convicted of stabbing tennis star Monica Seles remained free today on a\ntwo-year suspended jail sentence after a judge in Hamburg rejected an appeal\nby prosecutors and the injured athlete's lawyer to put him in prison. The\njudge upheld the sentence given in October 1993 to unemployed Guenther Parche,\nwho knifed Seles in the back during a tennis tournament. Parche later admitted\nhe carried out the attack so that his idol, German tennis player Steffi Graf,\ncould again top the world rankings.\n\nCREDIT: Drew Allan",
