    "text": "I would be the first to admit that I love watching college football, and\nbasketball in particular. But.\n\nI am proposing university/college sports, as they now exist in the USA, should\nbe totally eliminated. Try to be calm now and consider this proposal.\n\nUniversities are supposed to be centers of learning. They have evolved into\nindustries for professional sports in the United States. They provide free\nminor leagues for MLB, NFL and NBA. In many cases the athletes are \"rented\" to\ncolleges for a short time and then go on to professional sports.\n\nTelevision contracts have escalated to the point of having vast control over\ncollege sports programs to the point that the media owns these programs.\nBillions go for college football and basketball, and the other sports are\ntolerated and commonly called \"Olympic sports\" in many cases. The need to\n\"win\" has creating massive scandals and cheating in too many schools.\n\nThe amount of money universities in the United States spend on athletics is\nstaggering, and yet very few are able to actually bring in enough revenue to\ncover the vast costs of all of their sports programs . The United States is\nthe only country in the world with such sports programs based in institutions\nof higher learning. But how could our country compete on the world stage if we\neliminate college sports, you say?\n\nTo use the Olympics as a comparative, how do other countries manage to win so\nmany medals? I know, these are minor sports so many of those medals aren't\nreally important.\n\nOther countries have \"clubs\" that exist and provide avenues for sports\nparticipation. Many countries fund sports programs, as we do for our National\nOlympic organization. MLB does have extensive minor leagues for player\ndevelopment, but still many players are coming from universities now more than\nin the past. Even the NBA now has minor leagues, so why do we need to fund\ncollege basketball to develop their stars for a one-and-done freshman year?\nThe NFL really has no enduring functional minor league so college football is\nit.\n\nWhy do so many sports at our University of New Mexico, and of course other\ncolleges in the United States, have athletic scholarships given to students\nfrom outside the United States? The UNM Golf Team, for example, has many\nmembers who are not U.S. students \u0096 why does UNM even have a golf team in the\nfirst place? My tax dollars are supporting UNM in many ways, and it is strange\nto support students from other countries who attend college in the United\nStates to play their sport and get a publicly supported education at the same\ntime.\n\nIntramural sports can, and do, provide athletic outlets for students who are\ninterested in exercise and competition.\n\nAgain, why do sports programs need to be in universities?\n\nWhy should university students be required to pay continually rising athletic\nfees to attend school when many of them have no interest in participating,\nattending or even watching their college sports teams? This is outrageous and\nshould be stopped.\n\nSome television networks are so college-sports reliant that they would have a\ndifficult time staying on the air \u0096 sorry ESPN. Others rely on the mega-\nbillions from advertising for the NFL and the NBA. CBS Sports has basically\ncreated \"March Madness.\" The top echelon of NCAA football is a billion-dollar\nenterprise from the playoffs to \"The Championship Game.\"\n\nIn fact, the NCAA is all about money and power, and college athletes are just\nunpaid participants who actually bring in the dough.\n\nThis enormous amount of money has led to massive corruption for universities\nthat assist or at least allow athletes to be \"bribed\" to attend prestigious\nathletic programs \u0096 see Louisville University, University of Kansas and now\nallegedly Duke for a few examples.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a huge industry, and I admit it will not go quietly\nin the night with all that money at stake.",

    "title": "Here's one proposal: Eliminate university sports programs",
    "html": "<p>&#133; I would be the first to admit that I love watching college football, and basketball in particular. But.</p>\n<p>I am proposing university/college sports, as they now exist in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">USA</location>, should be totally eliminated. Try to be calm now and consider this proposal.</p>\n\n<p>Universities are supposed to be centers of learning. They have evolved into industries for professional sports in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. They provide free minor leagues for MLB, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> and NBA. In many cases the athletes are \"rented\" to colleges for a short time and then go on to professional sports.</p>\n\n<p>Television contracts have escalated to the point of having vast control over college sports programs to the point that the media owns these programs. Billions go for college football and basketball, and the other sports are tolerated and commonly called \"Olympic sports\" in many cases. The need to \"win\" has creating massive scandals and cheating in too many schools.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of money universities in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> spend on athletics is staggering, and yet very few are able to actually bring in enough revenue to cover the vast costs of all of their sports programs&#133;. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">The United States</location> is the only country in the world with such sports programs based in institutions of higher learning. But how could our country compete on the world stage if we eliminate college sports, you say?</p>\n\n<p>To use the <org>Olympics</org> as a comparative, how do other countries manage to win so many medals? I know, these are minor sports so many of those medals aren't really important.</p>\n\n<p>Other countries have \"clubs\" that exist and provide avenues for sports participation. Many countries fund sports programs, as we do for our National Olympic organization. MLB does have extensive minor leagues for player development, but still many players are coming from universities now more than in the past. Even the NBA now has minor leagues, so why do we need to fund college basketball to develop their stars for a one-and-done freshman year? The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> really has no enduring functional minor league so college football is it.</p>\n\n<p>Why do so many sports at our <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2623830218\">University of New Mexico</org>, and of course other colleges in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, have athletic scholarships given to students from outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>? The UNM Golf Team, for example, has many members who are not <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> students &#150; why does UNM even have a golf team in the first place? My tax dollars are supporting UNM in many ways, and it is strange to support students from other countries who attend college in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> to play their sport and get a publicly supported education at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Intramural sports can, and do, provide athletic outlets for students who are interested in exercise and competition.</p>\n\n<p>Again, why do sports programs need to be in universities?</p>\n\n<p>Why should university students be required to pay continually rising athletic fees to attend school when many of them have no interest in participating, attending or even watching their college sports teams? This is outrageous and should be stopped.</p>\n\n<p>Some television networks are so college-sports reliant that they would have a difficult time staying on the air &#150; sorry <org>ESPN</org>. Others rely on the mega-billions from advertising for the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> and the NBA. <org>CBS Sports</org> has basically created \"<org>March Madness</org>.\" The top echelon of <org>NCAA</org> football is a billion-dollar enterprise from the playoffs to \"The Championship Game.\"</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the <org>NCAA</org> is all about money and power, and college athletes are just unpaid participants who actually bring in the dough.</p>\n\n<p>This enormous amount of money has led to massive corruption for universities that assist or at least allow athletes to be \"bribed\" to attend prestigious athletic programs &#150; see <org>Louisville University</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2736489599\">University of Kansas</org> and now allegedly Duke for a few examples.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake, this is a huge industry, and I admit it will not go quietly in the night with all that money at stake.</p>",
