    "text": "Over the past few days, chefs, professors and staff from the Hudson County\nCommunity College (HCCC) Division of Business, Culinary Arts and Hospitality\nManagement have been working with Broadway and TV star Tituss Burgess to\nprepare over 300 hot lunches for clients of Let's Celebrate. The HCCC staff\nplated and served the to-go meals on Friday, May 22 at the Let's Celebrate\nSquare Meal Soup Kitchen, 46 Fairview Avenue in Jersey City.\n\nLet's Celebrate, Inc. is a nonprofit, community service organization that\nbegan feeding the homeless in Journal Square more than 30 years ago and has\ngrown to include a network of soup kitchens and food pantries throughout\nJersey City. The organization's mission is to move people from hunger to\nwholeness by providing a comprehensive group of food security, rental\nassistance, financial management and transitional housing programs.\n\nThe gourmet meals included Tuscan-style Herb-roasted Chicken, Jus Lie (lightly\nthickened natural juices) and Braised Leg of Veal A La Normande (apple scented\ndemi-glace sauce) served with Saffron Rice Pilaf, and Melange of Corn, Peas\nand Lima Beans O'Brien.\n\nHCCC President Dr. Chris Reber said that while the food was donated by the\nCollege, organizing, preparing and serving was completely reliant on the\ngoodness of the HCCC faculty and staff.\n\n\"We commend Assistant Professor Chef Gary Bensky, and Business, Culinary and\nHospitality Recruiter Janine Nunez for coordinating and preparing this\ncompassionate outreach for our community. We applaud Chef/Professor Anuchit\nPukdeedamrongrit (aka \"Chef Puk\"), Assistant to the Vice President of Planning\nand Development Mirta Sanchez, and Mr. Burgess, who spent two days preparing\nthe meals, and Adjunct Chef/Professors Susan DaSilva and Victor Moruzzi, who\nassisted in serving them.\"\n\nTituss Burgess made his Broadway debut in \"Good Vibrations\" in 2005, and went\non to perform in \"Jersey Boys,\" \"The Little Mermaid,\" and \"Guys and Dolls.\"\nMr. Burgess received four Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting\nActor in a Comedy series as a result of his starring role in the Netflix\ncomedy series, \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\" He has appeared in numerous TV\nseries, including \"Blue Bloods,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"The Good Fight,\" and is\nstarring opposite Jennifer Hudson in the Aretha Franklin biopic, \"Respect.\"\n\nThe HCCC Division of Business, Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management offers\ndegree and certificate programs that provide students with the knowledge and\nskills needed for in-demand employment sectors. The HCCC Culinary Arts and\nHospitality Management program is nationally recognized and accredited by the\nAmerican Culinary Federation Accrediting Commission and the American Culinary\nFederation Educational Foundation, a prestigious designation held by only a\nselect number of schools in the U.S.\n\nThe post HCCC Culinary Arts Chefs and Staff Prepare and Serve 300 Meals for\n'Let's Celebrate' appeared first on Hudson Reporter.",
