    "text": "BALTIMORE COUNTY-The fifth annual Chesapeake Bay Awareness Week is June 6 to\nthe 14, and local organizations are raising awareness about this valuable\neconomic and environmental resource-a national treasure that directly connects\nover 18 million residents.\n\nTypically, Chesapeake Bay Awareness Week is marked by a wide variety of events\nspanning the Bay's 64,000 square-mile watershed. This year's celebration will\nlook a bit different, as watershed residents continue to socially distance as\na result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLocal organizations work to protect the Bay all year round\n\nThis year's theme highlights the many creeks, rivers and streams that thread\nthrough the Chesapeake Bay region. These tributaries send fresh water into the\nBay, offer vital habitat to aquatic plants and animals and provide people with\npublic access points where they can fish, boat and swim.\n\nDespite not being able to gather together, the Back river Restoration\nCommittee and the Gunpowder Valley Conservation (GVC) are still helping people\nenjoy and celebrate the Chesapeake Bay every day.\n\n\"Awareness about the Chesapeake Bay begins at home! In the Avenue News\ncirculation area, we are connected to the Chesapeake by local rivers including\nBig Gunpowder Falls, Bird River, and Middle River,\" Amy Young, GVC\nCommunications Manager said via email.\n\n\"Homeowners can reduce water pollution to these local waterways by installing\nrain barrels and adding native plants to their landscapes. The Gunpowder\nValley Conservancy is always seeking volunteers to help plant trees and\nparticipate in stream clean-ups in eastern Baltimore County. Our volunteer\nwork will begin again later this summer in small groups adhering to current\nCovid-19 protocols.\"\n\nEstablished in 2009, the Back River Restoration Committee (BRRC) is a non-\nprofit organization dedicated to restoring the health of tidal the portion of\nthe Back River watershed.\n\n\"The Back River has been known for years as one of the most polluted rivers in\nMaryland, but we are out to change that reputation,\" it says on the\norganizations website.\n\n\"The river is naturally rebounding with a little help from Mother Nature and\nthe continual upgrades of the Waste Water Treatment facility. In 2011, Back\nRiver was one of only two areas marked as \"improved\" by the Chesapeake Bay\nProgram's report card.\n\nWe believe the time for recovery is now. Our organization is built on a hands-\non approach to tackling issues facing our river, and we follow that up with a\nstrong volunteer base ready to join in this fight. We had over 800 volunteers\nparticipate in our first year of operation and the number continues to grow.\"\n\nBRRC is hosting it's annual Golf Tournament on Wednesday September 2 from 7:00\na.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Rocky Point Golf Course.\n\n\"Hosting these types of events are critical in supporting our efforts to\ncleanup Back River and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay,\" it says on the\norganizations website.\n\nRecord amount of freshwater impacts Bay water quality\n\nExtreme weather conditions in 2018 affected Bay health in 2019. Record\nrainfall led to the highest amount of freshwater flows entering the Bay since\nmonitoring began in 1937, leading to lower salinity levels in parts of the Bay\nand contributing to the largest observed dead zone in the past five years.\n\n\"Extreme weather events, including record high freshwater flows, usually have\na negative impact on the Bay's living resources,\" said Scott Phillips,\nChesapeake Bay coordinator, U.S. Geological Survey and co-chair, Chesapeake\nBay Program Scientific, Technical Assessment and Reporting Team.\n\n\"However, while the record river flow, and associated nutrients, contributed\nto worsening dissolved-oxygen conditions, underwater grasses held steady and\nblue crab populations increased. The collective restoration efforts being\ncarried out by the Chesapeake Bay Program are improving the ecosystem and\nmaking it more resilient to extreme weather events.\"\n\nThis spring, the Chesapeake Bay Program released the 2018-19 Bay Barometer:\nHealth and Restoration in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, which further explains\nhow the entire Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and its watershed are responding to\nthe partnership's collective protection and restoration efforts.\n\nStriving to meet clean water standards\n\nThe Chesapeake Bay Program estimates that 38% of the Chesapeake Bay and its\ntidal tributaries met clean water standards for clarity (measured by\nunderwater grass abundance), dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a (a measure of\nalgae growth) between 2016 and 2018.\n\nThis score is lower than the record high 42% from the previous reporting\nperiod but is still the fifth highest estimate of water quality standards\nattainment since 1985.\n\nThis 4% decrease from the previous assessment period is due in large part to a\ndecline in dissolved oxygen in the open waters of the Bay, those areas beyond\nthe shoreline and shallows. Dissolved oxygen is necessary for the survival of\nthe Bay's aquatic species, and is a factor in the annual dead zone.\n\nHowever, dissolved oxygen conditions in deep water habitat (depths greater\nthan six feet) and measures of chlorophyll a along the Bay's surface shows\nimprovement from the 2015-2017 assessment period, which may indicate\nincreasing resilience. However, water quality must improve in 62% of the\nChesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries if the estuary is to function as a\nhealthy ecosystem.\n\nMaryland Board of Public works approves funding for clean water and the Bay\n\nThe Maryland Board of Public Works approved more than $16 million in grants\nlast week to reduce pollution and improve water quality. The board is composed\nof Governor Larry Hogan, Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp and Comptroller Peter\nFranchot. Lt. Governor Boyd K. Rutherford chaired today's meeting.\n\n\"These are smart investments to protect public health and prevent water\npollution in Maryland communities while saving money and energy,\" said\nMaryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles.\n\n\"Energy efficiency saves money and, along with the use of renewable energy,\nhelps the Chesapeake Bay by reducing nitrogen pollution. Upgrading septic\nsystems will also help us to green and grow the state's economy and lead in\nthe race to protect and restore Chesapeake Bay watersheds.\"\n\nThe following projects were approved:\n\nUpgrade Septic Systems \u0096 Statewide\n\nGrants from the Bay Restoration Fund totaling $15 million will provide funding\nfor counties to upgrade on-site sewage disposal (septic) systems and to\nconnect septic systems to public wastewater treatment plants to significantly\nreduce the discharge of nitrogen, one of the most serious pollutants in the\nChesapeake Bay. Counties will focus on upgrading septic systems located within\nthe critical area. All 23 Maryland counties will benefit from the grants.\n\nLED Lights for Montebello Filtration Plant project \u0096 Baltimore City\n\nA $685,597 Energy Water Infrastructure Program grant to the Mayor and City\nCouncil of Baltimore will fund the replacement of lighting fixtures at the\nMontebello Filtration Plant with energy efficient LED fixtures. The project\nwill reduce plant operating costs through lower energy use. The project is\nconsistent with the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act's statewide goal of reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.\n\nCarroll County Stormwater Management Restoration \u0096 Carroll County\n\nA $347,340 Bay Restoration Fund grant to Carroll County will help fund\nprojects to reduce the impact of stormwater runoff in urban areas of Carroll\nCounty as part of the county's efforts to improve water quality in local\nstreams and the Chesapeake Bay and to comply with its municipal stormwater\npermit. The work consists of the retrofit of existing stormwater management\nfacilities, the creation of new stormwater management facilities and stream\nrestoration. This board action is for the Greens of Westminster subproject.\nThis project is consistent with Maryland's climate change adaptation and\nresiliency objectives through the reduction of runoff that is exacerbated by\nincreased precipitation or flooding events.\n\nValued for its commercial and recreational value, the Chesapeake Bay is the\nnation's largest estuary, whose 64,000 square mile watershed includes\nDelaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia\nand West Virginia.\n\nFollow #OneChesapeake on social media during June 6-14 as we celebrate the\nrivers of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.bltmre\">BALTIMORE COUNTY</location>-The fifth annual Chesapeake Bay Awareness Week is <chron>June 6</chron> to the 14, and local organizations are raising awareness about this valuable economic and environmental resource-a national treasure that directly connects over 18 million residents.</p>\n<p>Typically, Chesapeake Bay Awareness Week is marked by a wide variety of events spanning the Bay's 64,000 square-mile watershed. This year's celebration will look a bit different, as watershed residents continue to socially distance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Local organizations work to protect the Bay all year round</p>\n\n<p>This year's theme highlights the many creeks, rivers and streams that thread through the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> region. These tributaries send fresh water into the Bay, offer vital habitat to aquatic plants and animals and provide people with public access points where they can fish, boat and swim.</p>\n\n<p>Despite not being able to gather together, the Back river Restoration Committee and the Gunpowder Valley Conservation (GVC) are still helping people enjoy and celebrate the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> every day.</p>\n\n<p>\"Awareness about the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> begins at home! In the <org>Avenue News</org> circulation area, we are connected to the Chesapeake by local rivers including <location>Big Gunpowder Falls</location>, <location>Bird River</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.midver\">Middle River</location>,\" <person>Amy Young</person>, <org>GVC Communications</org> Manager said via email.</p>\n\n<p>\"Homeowners can reduce water pollution to these local waterways by installing rain barrels and adding native plants to their landscapes. <org>The Gunpowder Valley Conservancy</org> is always seeking volunteers to help plant trees and participate in stream clean-ups in eastern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.bltmre\">Baltimore County</location>. Our volunteer work will begin again later this summer in small groups adhering to current Covid-19 protocols.\"</p>\n\n<p>Established in 2009, the Back River Restoration Committee (BRRC) is a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring the health of tidal the portion of the <location>Back River</location> watershed.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location>The Back River</location> has been known for years as one of the most polluted rivers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location>, but we are out to change that reputation,\" it says on the organizations website.</p>\n\n<p>\"The river is naturally rebounding with a little help from Mother Nature and the continual upgrades of the Waste Water Treatment facility. In 2011, <location>Back River</location> was one of only two areas marked as \"improved\" by the Chesapeake Bay Program's report card.</p>\n\n<p>We believe the time for recovery is now. Our organization is built on a hands-on approach to tackling issues facing our river, and we follow that up with a strong volunteer base ready to join in this fight. We had over 800 volunteers participate in our first year of operation and the number continues to grow.\"</p>\n\n<p>BRRC is hosting it's annual Golf Tournament on <chron>Wednesday September 2</chron> from <chron>7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</chron> at <org>Rocky Point Golf Course</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Hosting these types of events are critical in supporting our efforts to cleanup <location>Back River</location> and ultimately the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location>,\" it says on the organizations website.</p>\n\n<p>Record amount of freshwater impacts Bay water quality</p>\n\n<p>Extreme weather conditions in 2018 affected Bay health in 2019. Record rainfall led to the highest amount of freshwater flows entering the Bay since monitoring began in 1937, leading to lower salinity levels in parts of the Bay and contributing to the largest observed dead zone in the past five years.</p>\n\n<p>\"Extreme weather events, including record high freshwater flows, usually have a negative impact on the Bay's living resources,\" said <person>Scott Phillips</person>, <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> coordinator, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2868633903\">U.S. Geological Survey</org> and co-chair, Chesapeake Bay Program Scientific, Technical Assessment and Reporting Team.</p>\n\n<p>\"However, while the record river flow, and associated nutrients, contributed to worsening dissolved-oxygen conditions, underwater grasses held steady and blue crab populations increased. The collective restoration efforts being carried out by the Chesapeake Bay Program are improving the ecosystem and making it more resilient to extreme weather events.\"</p>\n\n<p>This spring, the Chesapeake Bay Program released the 2018-19 Bay Barometer: Health and Restoration in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, which further explains how the entire <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> ecosystem and its watershed are responding to the partnership's collective protection and restoration efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Striving to meet clean water standards</p>\n\n<p>The Chesapeake Bay Program estimates that 38% of the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> and its tidal tributaries met clean water standards for clarity (measured by underwater grass abundance), dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a (a measure of algae growth) between 2016 and 2018.</p>\n\n<p>This score is lower than the record high 42% from the previous reporting period but is still the fifth highest estimate of water quality standards attainment since 1985.</p>\n\n<p>This 4% decrease from the previous assessment period is due in large part to a decline in dissolved oxygen in the open waters of the Bay, those areas beyond the shoreline and shallows. Dissolved oxygen is necessary for the survival of the Bay's aquatic species, and is a factor in the annual dead zone.</p>\n\n<p>However, dissolved oxygen conditions in deep water habitat (depths greater than six feet) and measures of chlorophyll a along the Bay's surface shows improvement from the 2015-2017 assessment period, which may indicate increasing resilience. However, water quality must improve in 62% of the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> and its tidal tributaries if the estuary is to function as a healthy ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Maryland <org>Board of Public</org> works approves funding for clean water and the Bay</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0994571168\">Maryland Board of Public Works</org> approved more than <money>$16 million</money> in grants last week to reduce pollution and improve water quality. The board is composed of Governor <person>Larry Hogan</person>, Treasurer <person>Nancy K. Kopp</person> and Comptroller <person>Peter Franchot</person>. Lt. Governor <person>Boyd K. Rutherford</person> chaired today's meeting.</p>\n\n<p>\"These are smart investments to protect public health and prevent water pollution in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location> communities while saving money and energy,\" said Maryland Environment Secretary <person>Ben Grumbles</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Energy efficiency saves money and, along with the use of renewable energy, helps the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> by reducing nitrogen pollution. Upgrading septic systems will also help us to green and grow the state's economy and lead in the race to protect and restore <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> watersheds.\"</p>\n\n<p>The following projects were approved:</p>\n\n<p>Upgrade Septic Systems &#150; Statewide</p>\n\n<p>Grants from the <org>Bay Restoration Fund</org> totaling <money>$15 million</money> will provide funding for counties to upgrade on-site sewage disposal (septic) systems and to connect septic systems to public wastewater treatment plants to significantly reduce the discharge of nitrogen, one of the most serious pollutants in the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location>. Counties will focus on upgrading septic systems located within the critical area. All 23 <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location> counties will benefit from the grants.</p>\n\n<p>LED Lights for <location>Montebello Filtration Plant</location> project &#150; <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.bality\">Baltimore City</location></p>\n\n<p>A <money>$685,597</money> Energy Water Infrastructure Program grant to the <org>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore</org> will fund the replacement of lighting fixtures at the <location>Montebello Filtration Plant</location> with energy efficient LED fixtures. The project will reduce plant operating costs through lower energy use. The project is consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act's statewide goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030.</p>\n\n<p>Carroll County Stormwater Management Restoration &#150; <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.caroll\">Carroll County</location></p>\n\n<p>A <money>$347,340</money> <org>Bay Restoration Fund</org> grant to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.caroll\">Carroll County</location> will help fund projects to reduce the impact of stormwater runoff in urban areas of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.caroll\">Carroll County</location> as part of the county's efforts to improve water quality in local streams and the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> and to comply with its municipal stormwater permit. The work consists of the retrofit of existing stormwater management facilities, the creation of new stormwater management facilities and stream restoration. This board action is for the Greens of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.weiner\">Westminster</location> subproject. This project is consistent with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland's</location> climate change adaptation and resiliency objectives through the reduction of runoff that is exacerbated by increased precipitation or flooding events.</p>\n\n<p>Valued for its commercial and recreational value, the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> is the nation's largest estuary, whose 64,000 square mile watershed includes <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.de\">Delaware</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.dc\">District of Columbia</location>, Maryland, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wv\">West Virginia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Follow #OneChesapeake on social media during <chron>June 6-14</chron> as we celebrate the rivers of the <location>Chesapeake Bay</location> watershed.</p>",
