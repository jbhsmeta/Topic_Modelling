    "text": "THIS ISSUE: Mikey samples the entry-level turntable and top-of-the-line\ntonearm from the Lithuanian manufacturer Reed.\n\nAt the 2017 Hong Kong High End Audio/Video Show, I found myself sitting next\nto a turntable manufacturer who shall remain anonymous. A Reed Muse 3C\nturntable ($20,000) with 3P tonearm ($5500 for the 9.5\" version) sat on a\ndisplay table across from us. I'd favorably reviewed both of those products\n(1) and thought highly of them, but I was surprised when the manufacturer\nbeside me mentioned that he thought they were exceptional: ingenious, well-\nengineered, fine-sounding, and visually appealing. It's hard to say otherwise\nabout these Lithuanian-made products, but it's unusual for the competition to\nexpress such unreserved adulation. \"I agree!,\" I responded.\n\nCompared to that more costly flagship 'table, the Muse 1C ($15,000) has a\nlarger footprint and a more traditional-looking design. It weighs less--33lb\nvs the 3C's 55lb--and comes in either Moonlit Black or Karelian birch\nfinishes, instead of the 3C's machined aluminum. The 1C is arguably more\ndramatic and attractive looking, though both models look snazzy, down to the\nthin leather/suede platter mats supplied with all Reed turntables.\n\nThe 1C's drive system is derived from that of the 3C and uses the same main\nbearing and drive system. Central to this is an aluminum subplatter machined\nwith a tapered hub, driven by two opposing PLL (phase-locked loop)-controlled\nDC motors that turn at slightly different speeds; the two motor pulleys are\nfitted with rubber/ elastomer drive wheels of slightly different diameters.\nUnlike the 5C, which can be ordered, for an upcharge, with both dual\n\"friction-wheel\" drive and belt drive, the $15,000 1C can be ordered with\neither drive mechanism but not both.\n\nThe 6lb POM platter features a large-diameter, tapered, machined-aluminum\ninsert that fits securely over the subplatter's tapered hub to complete a\nstable, high-torque drive system that achieves speed quickly. The 1C plays\nfour speeds: 16.67, 33.3, 45, and 78. The 78rpm setting can be adjusted to\nbetween 70-85rpm to accommodate the various speeds appropriate to different\n78rpm records. Based on my Platterspeed app results, the 1C's relatively light\nplatter spins with impressive speed consistency.\n\nThe 1C accepts only one tonearm, 9.5-12\", to the 3C's two. Both models feature\nbuilt-in inclinometers that allow you to easily level the 'table without using\nadditional tools.\n\nThe pivoted, tangential-tracking 5T tonearm\n\nThe Reed 5T ($21,500) is a pivoted tonearm with a unique design that enables\nit to track tangentially. During record playback, a laser emitter located just\nbelow the upper vertical bearing points and a Gortlike laser sensor (2)\nlocated at the rearmost part of the arm assembly are used to track the\ntonearm's lateral motion; that information is used to adjust, on the fly, the\nposition of the tonearm's lateral pivot: a correction applied in real time by\nmeans of a small, battery-powered motor in the arm-mount assembly.\n\nAs the arm swings across the record, the player's three key points--the\nstylus, the tonearm pivot, and the record spindle-form a perfect right\ntriangle in three arm positions, spaced evenly across the record's grooved\narea. And in each of those triangles, the stylus is at the apex of the\n90[degrees] angle--and so there are three arm positions at which perfect\ntangency of stylus to groove is achieved, with relatively negligible lateral\ntracking error between those positions. Reed says the 5T's maximum error is [+\nor -]5 minutes of angle--ie, approximately V12 of a degree--whereas standard\npivoted arms usually have tracking errors of up to 1.5[degrees]. That's a big\nimprovement.\n\nThis works because Reed designed their moving-pivot mechanism with Thales's\ntheorem (3) in mind. The illustration on the facing page shows the geometry\ninvolved. In the illustration on the right, P1-01-P3 is the diameter of the\nconceptual semicircle on which Thales's theorem depends, and the triangles\nformed by P1-A1-P3, P1-A2P3, P1-A3-P3 are all right triangles. The line\nsegments A1B1-A2B2-A3B3 represent the tonearm's wand; P2 represents the center\nof a circle drawn through three points--Bl, B2, and B3 (the tonearm rotation\naxis); P3 is the linear sensor array, and B2-P3 is the la ser beam. The\ndiagram's key takeaway is that the tonearm is able to maintain the stylus with\nnear tangency to the record grooves, not only at the three A points shown but\nall across the playing surface.\n\nAlso, compared to pivoted arms (especially unnecessarily long ones), the 5T\nhas a smaller moment of inertia, so it tracks better. And in addition to the\nminimal lateral tracking error, the 5T's tangential tracking mechanism\naddresses antiskating concerns. Reed claims other advantages over other\ncompanies' tangential trackers: The Reed arm eschews air supplies and\ncompressors, for example, and its effective mass, in both vertical and\nhorizontal planes, is similar to that found in conventional arms.\n\nThe Reed 5T is available in allopaque silver metalwork (as supplied), in black\nmetal, and in black with gold accents. Wood options for the arm tubes include\nWenge, Makassar Ebony, Cocobolo, and Teak (Light or Dark). The arm's $21,500\nprice may be steep, but once you see the 5T in operation, it becomes an object\nof desire. It performed flawlessly throughout the review period.\n\nInstallation and setup\n\nI have quite a lot of experience setting up tonearms, but setting this one up\nwas an exercise in frustration, for reasons partly but not entirely my fault.\nEven under the best of circumstances, even the most experienced analog fans\nare likely to find the 5T's setup challenging. Designer Vidmantas Triukas, who\nis obviously a genius, apparently drinks all his buyers are geniuses as well.\n\nThe instructions do a good job of explaining certain elements of setup, such\nas how to use a supplied plastic alignment tool for measuring pivot-to-spindle\ndistance. But other topics aren't well-covered or are less than clearly\nspelled out.\n\nWhen at one point I was faced with a confusing section, I emailed the\nmanufacturer, who sent me the url for a video on YouTube, (4) which should\nhave been mentioned in the instructions.\n\nSome setup difficulties were of my own making. I didn't read the instruction\nmanual, as the manual itself suggests, before starting to unpack things. So\nwhen I unboxed a battery power supply, I saw it had two outputs and two\numbilicals. Was it unreasonable for me to assume, in the absence of\ninstructions to the contrary, that one cable would power the turntable and the\nother the tonearm's servo? The umbilicals fit that way, after all. But it\nturned out the second umbilical is for powering a second arm--not the\nturntable--and when I plugged it into the turntable's power-in socket, I blew\nan exotic cylindrical fuse that looked a little like a capacitor. With\nassistance from Reed, I tracked down a source for that part and ordered a\nreplacement. Digi-Key had it delivered the next day.\n\nHere's a suggestion: Provide a separate, less-detailed document--just one\nsheet, placed at the top of the box's contents--that maps out a basic setup\nstrategy, with a link to a video of the setup process. After the general\napproach has been grasped, more detailed, specific instructions would be\nhelpful. Instead of telling us to be sure a bearing is in the \"right\" or\n\"correct\" position, please show us what position is right and correct!\n\nAfter those frustrating experiences taught me some lessons, I found setting up\nthe arm somewhat straightforward. I say \"somewhat,\" because the alignment tool\ntook some getting used to; the instructions simply say \"use it.\" With a servo\nin play, you have to move the arm slowly across the arc; otherwise \"overload\"\nwill cause the system to stop operating. Unless you are paying attention to\nthe blinking LED next to Gort, you won't know that.\n\nUltimately, I was able to set up the costly Ortofon MC Century cartridge\nwithout incident-and wowza, did it sound great with this arm/'table combo! It\nsounded great, that is, when I remembered to turn the tonearm on. A few\nlistening sessions began with me thinking, \"The player sounds weird today,\"\nuntil I realized I hadn't powered up the arm. Then, after you power up the\nbattery supply--a fully charged battery will power the arm for 15 hours--you\nhave to activate the servo by pushing a button behind the Gort piece.\n\nThereafter, the 5T operates like a standard tonearm, only better, arguably--\nand certainly with less hassle than your typical high-horizontal-moving-mass\ntangential tracker.\n\nThe 5Ts horizontally positioned pivot points, which control vertical movement,\ncan each be adjusted to set azimuth to [+ or -]8[degrees]. And the entire arm\nmechanism rides up and down on a threaded post, allowing precise [+ or -]0.2mm\nvertical tracking angle and stylus rake angle adjustment. In addition, the\nwooden arm tube is user-replaceable, which allows you to change the tonearm's\neffective mass or swap out cartridges premounted on extra tubes.\n\nStable, timbrally neutral sound\n\nI can't separate the arm's performance from the 'table's (I'd love to try the\n5T on my Continuum Audio Labs Caliburn turntable), so let's talk about the\ncombination. The 1C and 5T did really well on the tap test--better than many\n\"fancy feet\"-equipped 'tables. Tapping anywhere on the plinth produced the\ntiniest of \"tinks,\" with no low-frequency component and no overhanging sound.\nTapping on the HRS base produced a somewhat lower frequency \"tink,\" but still\nnothing compared to the sounds produced on some more massive 'tables.\n\nI'd pulled out the Modern Jazz Quartet's European Concert (Atlantic SD 2-603)\nto show Ken Micallef for the video he recently shot of me for his YouTube\nchannel. (5) Well-recorded in Sweden in 1960, the MJQ record provides a good\ntest for image stability, transient clarity, bass extension, and soundstaging.\n\nAll across side one, the Reed produced a consistently wide soundstage with\nstable, unwavering, and cleanly drawn three-dimensional images: John Lewis's\npiano, left channel; Milt Jackson's vibes, right; drummer Connie Kay and\nbassist Percy Heath, centerstage. Over the decades I've played it, this\ndifficult-to-reproduce record just keeps sounding better! Apparently, what I\nonce thought were recording distortions in the piano and vibes were actually\ntracking issues--rendered virtually undetectable with the 5T in place.\n\nOn \"I Should Care,\" Kay's cymbals had the ideal sharp, metallic ring and\nnatural sizzle and decay. The snare was equally snappy, with no overhang, each\nhit cleanly evaporating into black. Percy Heath's compact bass lines combined\nwell-articulated-and-textured transient \"pop\" with generous \"live space\"\nsustain and decay that produced tuneful, nimble rhythmic swing--all this on a\nrecord that can show sloppy low-frequency overhang on lesser 'tables and arms.\nImages were properly sized, well-focused and neither bloated nor diffuse--ill\neffects some air-bearing tangential trackers create.\n\nThe 5T extracted musical fun from every record I played, plus a sense of ease\nand relaxation. It did everything well. Its overall performance was, top to\nbottom, timbrally well-balanced, \"musical,\" and artifact-free: sweet yet\ndetailed and open and airy like the 3P I reviewed a few years ago.\n\nThis tangential tracker especially excelled in soundstage stability and\nexpansiveness, all across the record surface, consistently. Tracking-error\ndistortions are not heard as \"distortion\" in the classic sense: With a\nproperly-setup pivoted arm, there's no \"buzzing\" or gross mistracking; if you\nhear that, you've made a serious setup mistake. Rather, it's heard to a great\ndegree as second-order harmonic \"fiizziness,\" particularly at soundstage\ncenter.\n\nOn this familiar live recording, I noticed an unusually well-balanced curtain\nof applause spread across the stage. Image focus and especially transient\nclarity were consistent through out the soundstage and across the entire\nrecord side.\n\nPlayback on the reference SAT CF1-09 arm (using the Ortofon MC Anna Diamond\ncartridge--which, while not identical, is very similar to the MC Century),\nwhich alone costs more than the Reed 1C and 5T combined, generally produced a\nmore subtle picture, yet it surprised by better expressing the vibe's\nshimmering, mesmerizing vibrato, which the Reed somewhat shortchanged. With\nthe SAT setup, the entire picture hung onto the decay far longer, and the bass\nweight was no contest--SAT for the easy win. The sheer bottom-end grip and\nforce produced a deeper stage that placed the drum kit farther back and behind\nthe bass. That bottom-end grip also added hall-sound perspective and brought\ngreater power to Heath's bass lines, particularly on the Arco bass that ends\nthe track.\n\nFor a serious test of the Reed 5Ts efficacy, I used Fiesta in Hi-Fi (Mercury\nSR 90134), side one of which is cut almost to the label. The SAT arm's\ngeometry uses Lofgren alignment, though that assumes that the inner most\ngroove radius is 75mm, which is optimistic: On this record, I measured\nmodulated grooves to within 56mm of the record center! Beyond the second null\npoint, which falls at 80.66mm, distortion rises rapidly.\n\nIs it audible? The side ends with Ron Nelson's rousing \"Savannah River\nHoliday,\" and here again there was no contest, but with a different winner.\nThe Reed 5T remained focused to the very end of the side, with a wide stage\nupon which each instrument was cleanly delineated. You'd never know you were\nat the end of the side, especially one cut so close to the label. It was\nremarkable, and far superior to more typical tangential trackers, which\nusually produce \"tail wagging the dog\" spatial wavering. The SAT produced in\nthe post-null space a narrower stage on which the instruments were soft and\nsmeared. It only lasted a short time and was neither unpleasant nor distorted-\nsounding. It just seemed degraded compared to most of the side. The 5T was\nclearly superior here.\n\nThat experience drove me to play the test pressing of the D2D Bruckner 7 I've\npreviously written about, which should be out by the time this column is\npublished. The Reed 1C/5T combo killed (in the good sense) on this simply\nmiked record, producing airy, smooth violins and violas and giving proper\nweight to the double basses, rumbling timpani, and, at the end of the first\nmovement, a majestic presentation of the horns--plus a grand sense of the\nBerlin Philharmonie space.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor less than $40,000, you can get the combination of the Reed Muse 1C--a\nhandsome, well-designed, dual-friction-drive (or belt-drive), high-performance\nturntable--and the 5T tonearm, an ingeniously designed, tangential-tracking\narm that delivers what it promises for playback--spatially, dynamically, and\ntimbrally. The 1C plays at accurate and consistent speed. It is quiet and\nwell-isolated from the outside world, and it passes the \"tap test\" better than\nmany other turntables do.\n\nAs for the 5T tonearm, I'd say you can get better bottom-end performance from\nless costly arms such as Graham's Elite, perhaps because the Reed arm isn't\ngrounded to the plinth but is instead riding on the tangential merry-go-round.\n\nBut what the 5T arm does so well--especially spatially and without the usual\ntangential hassles--makes it special, an object of desire for vinyl lovers\nlucky enough to hear it.\n\nWriting instruction manuals might not be his forte, but Mr. Triukas has\ndesigned a brilliant turntable and tonearm in the 1C and 5T, respectively, and\nsomehow manages to produce them for a price that won't break many highend\nbanks.\n\n(1) See Vol.39 No.4 and Vol.40 No.ll.\n\n(2) See\n[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gort_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gort_)(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still).\n\n(3) If the center of a triangle's circumcircle lies on the triangle, then the\ntriangle is a right triangle, and the center of that circumcircle lies on the\ntriangle's hypotenuse.\n\n(4) See\n[youtube.com/watch?v=44HMDmE5aZg](http://youtube.com/watch?v=44HMDmE5aZg).\n\n(5) See\n[youtube.com/watch?v=ZfTiy_gRoEA](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZfTiy_gRoEA).\n\nCONTACTS\n\nReed\n\nNaujuju Muniskiu km.\n\nUzliedziu sen.\n\n54317 Kauno rej.\n\nLithuania\n\nTel: 3870 610 41639\n\nWeb: reed.lt\n\nUS distributor\n\nAxiss Audio\n\n17800 S.

    "title": "The Reed Muse 1C Turntable and 5T Tonearm.(ANALOG CORNER)",
    "html": "<p>THIS ISSUE: Mikey samples the entry-level turntable and\ntop-of-the-line tonearm from the Lithuanian manufacturer Reed.</p>\n\n<p>At the 2017 Hong Kong High End Audio/Video Show, I found myself\nsitting next to a turntable manufacturer who shall remain anonymous. A\n<person>Reed Muse</person> 3C turntable (<money>$20,000</money>) with 3P tonearm (<money>$5500</money> for the\n9.5\" version) sat on a display table across from us. I'd\nfavorably reviewed both of those products (1) and thought highly of\nthem, but I was surprised when the manufacturer beside me mentioned that\nhe thought they were exceptional: ingenious, well-engineered,\nfine-sounding, and visually appealing. It's hard to say otherwise\nabout these Lithuanian-made products, but it's unusual for the\ncompetition to express such unreserved adulation. \"I agree!,\"\nI responded.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to that more costly flagship 'table, the Muse 1C\n(<money>$15,000</money>) has a larger footprint and a more traditional-looking design.\nIt weighs less--33lb vs the 3C's 55lb--and comes in either Moonlit\nBlack or Karelian birch finishes, instead of the 3C's machined\naluminum. The 1C is arguably more dramatic and attractive looking,\nthough both models look snazzy, down to the thin leather/suede platter\nmats supplied with all Reed turntables.</p>\n\n<p>The 1C's drive system is derived from that of the 3C and uses\nthe same main bearing and drive system. Central to this is an aluminum\nsubplatter machined with a tapered hub, driven by two opposing PLL\n(phase-locked loop)-controlled DC motors that turn at slightly different\nspeeds; the two motor pulleys are fitted with rubber/ elastomer drive\nwheels of slightly different diameters. Unlike the 5C, which can be\nordered, for an upcharge, with both dual \"friction-wheel\"\ndrive and belt drive, the <money>$15,000</money> 1C can be ordered with either drive\nmechanism but not both.</p>\n\n<p>The 6lb POM platter features a large-diameter, tapered,\nmachined-aluminum insert that fits securely over the subplatter's\ntapered hub to complete a stable, high-torque drive system that achieves\nspeed quickly. The 1C plays four speeds: 16.67, 33.3, 45, and 78. The\n78rpm setting can be adjusted to between 70-85rpm to accommodate the\nvarious speeds appropriate to different 78rpm records. Based on my\nPlatterspeed app results, the 1C's relatively light platter spins\nwith impressive speed consistency.</p>\n\n<p>The 1C accepts only one tonearm, 9.5-12\", to the 3C's\ntwo. Both models feature built-in inclinometers that allow you to easily\nlevel the 'table without using additional tools.</p>\n\n<p>The pivoted, tangential-tracking 5T tonearm</p>\n\n<p>The Reed 5T (<money>$21,500</money>) is a pivoted tonearm with a unique design\nthat enables it to track tangentially. During record playback, a laser\nemitter located just below the upper vertical bearing points and a\nGortlike laser sensor (2) located at the rearmost part of the arm\nassembly are used to track the tonearm's lateral motion; that\ninformation is used to adjust, on the fly, the position of the\ntonearm's lateral pivot: a correction applied in real time by means\nof a small, battery-powered motor in the arm-mount assembly.</p>\n\n<p>As the arm swings across the record, the player's three key\npoints--the stylus, the tonearm pivot, and the record spindle-form a\nperfect right triangle in three arm positions, spaced evenly across the\nrecord's grooved area. And in each of those triangles, the stylus\nis at the apex of the 90[degrees] angle--and so there are three arm\npositions at which perfect tangency of stylus to groove is achieved,\nwith relatively negligible lateral tracking error between those\npositions. Reed says the 5T's maximum error is [+ or -]5 minutes of\nangle--ie, approximately V12 of a degree--whereas standard pivoted arms\nusually have tracking errors of up to 1.5[degrees]. That's a big\nimprovement.</p>\n\n<p>This works because Reed designed their moving-pivot mechanism with\nThales's theorem (3) in mind. The illustration on the facing page\nshows the geometry involved. In the illustration on the right, P1-01-P3\nis the diameter of the conceptual semicircle on which Thales's\ntheorem depends, and the triangles formed by P1-A1-P3, P1-A2P3, P1-A3-P3\nare all right triangles. The line segments A1B1-A2B2-A3B3 represent the\ntonearm's wand; P2 represents the center of a circle drawn through\nthree points--Bl, B2, and B3 (the tonearm rotation axis); P3 is the\nlinear sensor array, and B2-P3 is the la ser beam. The diagram's\nkey takeaway is that the tonearm is able to maintain the stylus with\nnear tangency to the record grooves, not only at the three A points\nshown but all across the playing surface.</p>\n\n<p>Also, compared to pivoted arms (especially unnecessarily long\nones), the 5T has a smaller moment of inertia, so it tracks better. And\nin addition to the minimal lateral tracking error, the 5T's\ntangential tracking mechanism addresses antiskating concerns. Reed\nclaims other advantages over other companies' tangential trackers:\nThe Reed arm eschews air supplies and compressors, for example, and its\neffective mass, in both vertical and horizontal planes, is similar to\nthat found in conventional arms.</p>\n\n<p>The Reed 5T is available in allopaque silver metalwork (as\nsupplied), in black metal, and in black with gold accents. Wood options\nfor the arm tubes include Wenge, Makassar Ebony, Cocobolo, and Teak\n(Light or Dark). The arm's <money>$21,500</money> price may be steep, but once you\nsee the 5T in operation, it becomes an object of desire. It performed\nflawlessly throughout the review period.</p>\n\n<p>Installation and setup</p>\n\n<p>I have quite a lot of experience setting up tonearms, but setting\nthis one up was an exercise in frustration, for reasons partly but not\nentirely my fault. Even under the best of circumstances, even the most\nexperienced analog fans are likely to find the 5T's setup\nchallenging. Designer <person>Vidmantas Triukas</person>, who is obviously a genius,\napparently drinks all his buyers are geniuses as well.</p>\n\n<p>The instructions do a good job of explaining certain elements of\nsetup, such as how to use a supplied plastic alignment tool for\nmeasuring pivot-to-spindle distance. But other topics aren't\nwell-covered or are less than clearly spelled out.</p>\n\n<p>When at one point I was faced with a confusing section, I emailed\nthe manufacturer, who sent me the url for a video on YouTube, (4) which\nshould have been mentioned in the instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Some setup difficulties were of my own making. I didn't read\nthe instruction manual, as the manual itself suggests, before starting\nto unpack things. So when I unboxed a battery power supply, I saw it had\ntwo outputs and two umbilicals. Was it unreasonable for me to assume, in\nthe absence of instructions to the contrary, that one cable would power\nthe turntable and the other the tonearm's servo? The umbilicals fit\nthat way, after all. But it turned out the second umbilical is for\npowering a second arm--not the turntable--and when I plugged it into the\nturntable's power-in socket, I blew an exotic cylindrical fuse that\nlooked a little like a capacitor. With assistance from Reed, I tracked\ndown a source for that part and ordered a replacement. Digi-Key had it\ndelivered the next day.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a suggestion: Provide a separate, less-detailed\ndocument--just one sheet, placed at the top of the box's\ncontents--that maps out a basic setup strategy, with a link to a video\nof the setup process. After the general approach has been grasped, more\ndetailed, specific instructions would be helpful. Instead of telling us\nto be sure a bearing is in the \"right\" or \"correct\"\nposition, please show us what position is right and correct!</p>\n\n<p>After those frustrating experiences taught me some lessons, I found\nsetting up the arm somewhat straightforward. I say \"somewhat,\"\nbecause the alignment tool took some getting used to; the instructions\nsimply say \"use it.\" With a servo in play, you have to move\nthe arm slowly across the arc; otherwise \"overload\" will cause\nthe system to stop operating. Unless you are paying attention to the\nblinking LED next to Gort, you won't know that.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I was able to set up the costly Ortofon MC Century\ncartridge without incident-and wowza, did it sound great with this\narm/'table combo! It sounded great, that is, when I remembered to\nturn the tonearm on. A few listening sessions began with me thinking,\n\"The player sounds weird today,\" until I realized I\nhadn't powered up the arm. Then, after you power up the battery\nsupply--a fully charged battery will power the arm for 15 hours--you\nhave to activate the servo by pushing a button behind the Gort piece.</p>\n\n<p>Thereafter, the 5T operates like a standard tonearm, only better,\narguably--and certainly with less hassle than your typical\nhigh-horizontal-moving-mass tangential tracker.</p>\n\n<p>The 5Ts horizontally positioned pivot points, which control\nvertical movement, can each be adjusted to set azimuth to [+ or\n-]8[degrees]. And the entire arm mechanism rides up and down on a\nthreaded post, allowing precise [+ or -]0.2mm vertical tracking angle\nand stylus rake angle adjustment. In addition, the wooden arm tube is\nuser-replaceable, which allows you to change the tonearm's\neffective mass or swap out cartridges premounted on extra tubes.</p>\n\n<p>Stable, timbrally neutral sound</p>\n\n<p>I can't separate the arm's performance from the\n'table's (I'd love to try the 5T on my Continuum Audio\nLabs Caliburn turntable), so let's talk about the combination. The\n1C and 5T did really well on the tap test--better than many \"fancy\nfeet\"-equipped 'tables. Tapping anywhere on the plinth\nproduced the tiniest of \"tinks,\" with no low-frequency\ncomponent and no overhanging sound. Tapping on the HRS base produced a\nsomewhat lower frequency \"tink,\" but still nothing compared to\nthe sounds produced on some more massive 'tables.</p>\n\n<p>I'd pulled out the <org>Modern Jazz Quartet's</org> European Concert\n(Atlantic SD 2-603) to show <person>Ken Micallef</person> for the video he recently shot\nof me for his YouTube channel. (5) Well-recorded in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/se\">Sweden</location> in 1960, the\nMJQ record provides a good test for image stability, transient clarity,\nbass extension, and soundstaging.</p>\n\n<p>All across side one, the Reed produced a consistently wide\nsoundstage with stable, unwavering, and cleanly drawn three-dimensional\nimages: <person>John Lewis's</person> piano, left channel; <person>Milt Jackson's</person>\nvibes, right; drummer <person>Connie Kay</person> and bassist <person>Percy Heath</person>, centerstage.\nOver the decades I've played it, this difficult-to-reproduce record\njust keeps sounding better! Apparently, what I once thought were\nrecording distortions in the piano and vibes were actually tracking\nissues--rendered virtually undetectable with the 5T in place.</p>\n\n<p>On \"I Should Care,\" Kay's cymbals had the ideal\nsharp, metallic ring and natural sizzle and decay. The snare was equally\nsnappy, with no overhang, each hit cleanly evaporating into black. <person>Percy\nHeath's</person> compact bass lines combined well-articulated-and-textured\ntransient \"pop\" with generous \"live space\" sustain\nand decay that produced tuneful, nimble rhythmic swing--all this on a\nrecord that can show sloppy low-frequency overhang on lesser\n'tables and arms. Images were properly sized, well-focused and\nneither bloated nor diffuse--ill effects some air-bearing tangential\ntrackers create.</p>\n\n<p>The 5T extracted musical fun from every record I played, plus a\nsense of ease and relaxation. It did everything well. Its overall\nperformance was, top to bottom, timbrally well-balanced,\n\"musical,\" and artifact-free: sweet yet detailed and open and\nairy like the 3P I reviewed a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p>This tangential tracker especially excelled in soundstage stability\nand expansiveness, all across the record surface, consistently.\nTracking-error distortions are not heard as \"distortion\" in\nthe classic sense: With a properly-setup pivoted arm, there's no\n\"buzzing\" or gross mistracking; if you hear that, you've\nmade a serious setup mistake. Rather, it's heard to a great degree\nas second-order harmonic \"fiizziness,\" particularly at\nsoundstage center.</p>\n\n<p>On this familiar live recording, I noticed an unusually\nwell-balanced curtain of applause spread across the stage. Image focus\nand especially transient clarity were consistent through out the\nsoundstage and across the entire record side.</p>\n\n<p>Playback on the reference SAT CF1-09 arm (using the Ortofon MC <person>Anna\nDiamond</person> cartridge--which, while not identical, is very similar to the MC\nCentury), which alone costs more than the Reed 1C and 5T combined,\ngenerally produced a more subtle picture, yet it surprised by better\nexpressing the vibe's shimmering, mesmerizing vibrato, which the\nReed somewhat shortchanged. With the SAT setup, the entire picture hung\nonto the decay far longer, and the bass weight was no contest--SAT for\nthe easy win. The sheer bottom-end grip and force produced a deeper\nstage that placed the drum kit farther back and behind the bass. That\nbottom-end grip also added hall-sound perspective and brought greater\npower to Heath's bass lines, particularly on the Arco bass that\nends the track.</p>\n\n<p>For a serious test of the Reed 5Ts efficacy, I used Fiesta in Hi-Fi\n(Mercury SR 90134), side one of which is cut almost to the label. The\nSAT arm's geometry uses Lofgren alignment, though that assumes that\nthe inner most groove radius is 75mm, which is optimistic: On this\nrecord, I measured modulated grooves to within 56mm of the record\ncenter! Beyond the second null point, which falls at 80.66mm, distortion\nrises rapidly.</p>\n\n<p>Is it audible? The side ends with <person>Ron Nelson's</person> rousing\n\"<person>Savannah River Holiday</person>,\" and here again there was no contest,\nbut with a different winner. The Reed 5T remained focused to the very\nend of the side, with a wide stage upon which each instrument was\ncleanly delineated. You'd never know you were at the end of the\nside, especially one cut so close to the label. It was remarkable, and\nfar superior to more typical tangential trackers, which usually produce\n\"tail wagging the dog\" spatial wavering. The SAT produced in\nthe post-null space a narrower stage on which the instruments were soft\nand smeared. It only lasted a short time and was neither unpleasant nor\ndistorted-sounding. It just seemed degraded compared to most of the\nside. The 5T was clearly superior here.</p>\n\n<p>That experience drove me to play the test pressing of the D2D\nBruckner 7 I've previously written about, which should be out by\nthe time this column is published. The Reed 1C/5T combo killed (in the\ngood sense) on this simply miked record, producing airy, smooth violins\nand violas and giving proper weight to the double basses, rumbling\ntimpani, and, at the end of the first movement, a majestic presentation\nof the horns--plus a grand sense of the Berlin Philharmonie space.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>For less than <money>$40,000</money>, you can get the combination of the Reed Muse\n1C--a handsome, well-designed, dual-friction-drive (or belt-drive),\nhigh-performance turntable--and the 5T tonearm, an ingeniously designed,\ntangential-tracking arm that delivers what it promises for\nplayback--spatially, dynamically, and timbrally. The 1C plays at\naccurate and consistent speed. It is quiet and well-isolated from the\noutside world, and it passes the \"tap test\" better than many\nother turntables do.</p>\n\n<p>As for the 5T tonearm, I'd say you can get better bottom-end\nperformance from less costly arms such as Graham's Elite, perhaps\nbecause the Reed arm isn't grounded to the plinth but is instead\nriding on the tangential merry-go-round.</p>\n\n<p>But what the 5T arm does so well--especially spatially and without\nthe usual tangential hassles--makes it special, an object of desire for\nvinyl lovers lucky enough to hear it.</p>\n\n<p>Writing instruction manuals might not be his forte, but <person>Mr. Triukas</person>\nhas designed a brilliant turntable and tonearm in the 1C and 5T,\nrespectively, and somehow manages to produce them for a price that\nwon't break many highend banks.</p>\n\n<p>(1) See Vol.39 No.4 and Vol.40 No.ll.</p>\n\n<p>(2) See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gort_\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gort_</a>(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still).</p>\n\n<p>(3) If the center of a triangle's circumcircle lies on the\ntriangle, then the triangle is a right triangle, and the center of that\ncircumcircle lies on the triangle's hypotenuse.</p>\n\n<p>(4) See <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=44HMDmE5aZg\">youtube.com/watch?v=44HMDmE5aZg</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(5) See <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZfTiy_gRoEA\">youtube.com/watch?v=ZfTiy_gRoEA</a>.</p>\n\n<p>CONTACTS</p>\n\n<p>Reed</p>\n\n<p>Naujuju Muniskiu km.</p>\n\n<p>Uzliedziu sen.</p>\n\n<p>54317 Kauno rej.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/lt\">Lithuania</location></p>\n\n<p>Tel: 3870 610 41639</p>\n\n<p>Web: reed.lt</p>\n\n<p>US distributor</p>\n\n<p>Axiss Audio</p>\n\n<p><location>17800 S.
