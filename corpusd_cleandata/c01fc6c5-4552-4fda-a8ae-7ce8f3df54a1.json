    "text": "CENTER LINE \\- Being the first at anything often comes with a special\nresponsibility, and that's not lost on attorney Nick Hannawa, co-founder of\nClinic Cannabis Co., Center Line's first medical marijuana dispensary.\n\n\"It's going to be the first state-licensed medical marijuana facility in\nMacomb County. I think that's a big deal,\" Hannawa said. \"You kind of set the\nexample for what members of the community should expect.\"\n\nWhat they'll see at his dispensary, Hannawa said, is a business that plays by\nthe rules set forth by Center Line's elected leaders and administrative team.\nThey planned a soft opening for June 5, almost two and a half years after the\nCity Council approved the local medical marijuana facilities ordinance and\nalmost three and half years after the state of Michigan's Medical Marihuana\nFacilities Licensing Act went into effect.\n\n\"I do want the public to know that these facilities are beginning to open in\nCenter Line,\" City Manager Dennis Champine said. \"We've worked hard on this\nproject, and we certainly have some of the best rules and laws in the state of\nMichigan, as far as I'm concerned.\n\n\"We've had a great deal of success with the number of permits that were\nrequested and approved,\" Champine said.\n\nCenter Line has opted out of permitting recreational marijuana businesses, and\nits ordinance sets very specific requirements for medical marijuana\nprovisioning centers (dispensaries), three classes of grow operations,\nprocessing centers, safety compliance facilities and secure transporters.\n\nHannawa said fencing around Clinic Cannabis, on Lawrence Avenue at the\nInterstate 696 service drive, was one requirement. Surveillance video that can\nbe directly monitored by the Center Line Public Safety Department is another\nthat all medical marijuana facilities in the city must follow.\n\nNot all cities have the same rules, but Hannawa said the requirements and his\noperation's compliance would leave nothing for patients or neighbors to be\nconcerned about.\n\n\"They're going to be pleasantly surprised at what a professional, respectable,\ndignified operation that we run,\" Hannawa said.\n\nHannawa, a native Detroiter, also owns and operates the state-licensed\nNorthern Roots Provisioning Center in Oscoda. He said the Center Line project\ncost more than $1 million, which included a significant investment in the\n4,000 square foot building the company leases.\n\nChampine said one advantage for Center Line is that the zoning requirements\nrestrict medical marijuana businesses to one area of the small city. The\nadministrative team identified 32 potential qualified properties in that area.\nIf all of those fill up, the city could award a maximum of 95 permits spread\nacross all different facility types, if \"stacked\" to the maximum potential.\n\nStacking refers to the issuance of multiple facility-type permits at the same\nproperty in accordance with state guidelines.\n\nCenter Line currently has issued all 15 of its provisioning center permits.\nThe number was approved by the City Council. Two processing center permits\nhave also been issued. Grow permits in various classifications tied to the\nnumber of plants on the property continue to move through the council for\napproval.\n\nThe influx of tax assessments from the new facilities could be a boon for the\ncity and a break for city taxpayers. Champine also said permits and fees have\nalready netted $270,000 in new revenue, and he projected the total increase in\nrevenue could reach $500,000 when adding the city's portion of any tax from\nmedical marijuana sales.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">CENTER LINE</location> - Being the first at anything often comes with a special responsibility, and that's not lost on attorney <person>Nick Hannawa</person>, co-founder of <org>Clinic Cannabis Co.</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line's</location> first medical marijuana dispensary.</p>\n<p>\"It's going to be the first state-licensed medical marijuana facility in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.macomb\">Macomb County</location>. I think that's a big deal,\" Hannawa said. \"You kind of set the example for what members of the community should expect.\"</p>\n\n<p>What they'll see at his dispensary, Hannawa said, is a business that plays by the rules set forth by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line's</location> elected leaders and administrative team. They planned a soft opening for <chron>June 5</chron>, almost two and a half years after the <org>City Council</org> approved the local medical marijuana facilities ordinance and almost three and half years after the state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan's</location> Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act went into effect.</p>\n\n<p>\"I do want the public to know that these facilities are beginning to open in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line</location>,\" City Manager <person>Dennis Champine</person> said. \"We've worked hard on this project, and we certainly have some of the best rules and laws in the state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location>, as far as I'm concerned.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've had a great deal of success with the number of permits that were requested and approved,\" Champine said.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line</location> has opted out of permitting recreational marijuana businesses, and its ordinance sets very specific requirements for medical marijuana provisioning centers (dispensaries), three classes of grow operations, processing centers, safety compliance facilities and secure transporters.</p>\n\n<p>Hannawa said fencing around Clinic Cannabis, on <location>Lawrence Avenue</location> at the <location>Interstate 696</location> service drive, was one requirement. Surveillance video that can be directly monitored by the <org>Center Line Public Safety Department</org> is another that all medical marijuana facilities in the city must follow.</p>\n\n<p>Not all cities have the same rules, but Hannawa said the requirements and his operation's compliance would leave nothing for patients or neighbors to be concerned about.</p>\n\n<p>\"They're going to be pleasantly surprised at what a professional, respectable, dignified operation that we run,\" Hannawa said.</p>\n\n<p>Hannawa, a native Detroiter, also owns and operates the state-licensed Northern Roots Provisioning Center in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.oscoda\">Oscoda</location>. He said the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line</location> project cost more than <money>$1 million</money>, which included a significant investment in the 4,000 square foot building the company leases.</p>\n\n<p>Champine said one advantage for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line</location> is that the zoning requirements restrict medical marijuana businesses to one area of the small city. The administrative team identified 32 potential qualified properties in that area. If all of those fill up, the city could award a maximum of 95 permits spread across all different facility types, if \"stacked\" to the maximum potential.</p>\n\n<p>Stacking refers to the issuance of multiple facility-type permits at the same property in accordance with state guidelines.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.cenine\">Center Line</location> currently has issued all 15 of its provisioning center permits. The number was approved by the <org>City Council</org>. Two processing center permits have also been issued. Grow permits in various classifications tied to the number of plants on the property continue to move through the council for approval.</p>\n\n<p>The influx of tax assessments from the new facilities could be a boon for the city and a break for city taxpayers. Champine also said permits and fees have already netted <money>$270,000</money> in new revenue, and he projected the total increase in revenue could reach <money>$500,000</money> when adding the city's portion of any tax from medical marijuana sales.</p>",
