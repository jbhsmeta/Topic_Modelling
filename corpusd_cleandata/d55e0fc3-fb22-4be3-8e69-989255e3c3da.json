    "text": "This fortnight's top free and paid-for apps for Android and iOS phones and\ntablets\n\nApp of the Fortnight\n\nVIDEO\n\nVimeo Create\n\nbit.ly/vimeodroid497\n\nbit.ly/vimeoios497\n\n#6 #11\n\nOnce upon a time, only successful businesses could afford to use video as a\npromotional tool. These days, however, the format has been democratised since\nmost of us carry a high-quality HD (or even 4K) video camera in our pockets.\nThis makes it easy for small businesses and individuals to get great shots to\npromote themselves - or just show off on social media.\n\nHowever, filming the footage is one thing - making it look like a proper piece\nof promotion is another skill altogether. That's why video-streaming service\nVimeo has released this new app. Vimeo Create is fresh out of beta and it\nallows users to make professional-looking promo clips, either by starting with\nsome of Vimeo's pre-built templates or by building one from scratch using your\nown footage.\n\nCreating videos is a simple, step-by-step process - just select your clips,\nadd a cool-looking style, then layer on some music and let the tool's smart\nvideo creator do the rest. The results can be pretty attention-grabbing, and\nyou can tweak any elements that aren't quite to your liking.\n\nThe app is completely free to download and use but, If you're not already\nsigned up to one of Vimeo's paid-for subscription services, you'll need to\nupgrade your membership to save and publish your clips to Vimeo's streaming\nplatform. Vimeo Pro costs \u00a316 per month, though one way to get around this is\nto use the 30-day free trial you get when you first sign up. It's also worth\nnoting that some features, including adding logos and branding to your clips,\nrequire Vimeo's more expensive (\u00a340 per month) Business subscription.\n\nOur rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMINI WORKSHOP\n\nCreate professional videos with Vimeo Create\n\n1 Launch Vimeo Create and you'll be asked to join: if you don't have an\naccount, choose one of the options to sign up; if you do, tap the small 'Log\nin' option at the bottom of the screen or tap Skip (topright) to use the tool\nwithout signing in for now. You'll be taken to the main screen, where you can\nchoose or search \u0412 for predesigned templates |2 that you can customise.\n\n2 To create a video from scratch, tap the green plus-sign (+) icon, then press\nAllow to let Vimeo Create access videos and other media stored on your device.\nGive your video a name and tap OK. At the top of the screen, press the 'Camera\nroll', Stock, Google Photos or Uploads tabs IT to select your source, then\nbrowse for a clip you want and tap its thumbnail. |2 Tap Next. \u215b\n\n3 Press Add on the next screen to add further clips or text. Vimeo Business\nusers can also add branding here. For the time being, just tap Next, then\nselect a Style from the pre-built selection and tap Next again. You'll be\noffered a selection of licensed tunes to accompany your video. Press the Play\nicon |1 to hear them, then tap the thumbnail 12 to select the tune you want to\nuse and tap Create. El\n\nTOOLS\n\nAppNotifier\n\nbit. ly/ appnotifier497\n\n#5\n\nRecently, many Android users have noticed that the Play Store has suddenly\nstopped showing notifications for updated apps. Initially, there was some\nconfusion as to whether this was just a bug, but then Google appeared to\nconfirm that it was an intentional feature change. Either way, it hasn't been\nparticularly well received and we've heard rumours that Google might be\nbringing the feature back. Until then, this app could be the answer - it shows\na notification each time an app is installed or updated on your device.\n\nOur rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGAME\n\nChess Ace\n\nbit. ly/ chessdroid497\n\nbit.ly/chessios497\n\n#4.4 4 9\n\nLove chess? Enjoy playing cards? Well, now you can do both, thanks to this\nclever game. It's basically a puzzle where you're tasked with navigating a 5 x\n5 chessboard using a limited number of chess moves, with the aim being to\ncollect all the clubs on the board. Things start off simple but soon get\nchallenging. Chess Ace offers 250 levels and several different skins to choose\nfrom. You can unlock 'ranked play', to compare your achievements with others,\nafter you've completed a certain number of levels.\n\nOur rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLego Legacy: Heroes Unboxed\n\nbit.ly/legodroid497\n\nbit.ly/legoios497\n\n44.4\u00ab9\n\nLego minifigures are eminently collectible, which may be one of the drivers\nfor developing this new mobile game. Heroes Unboxed is part role-playing game\nand part collect-'em-up, with heavy shades of Pokemon. The idea is to unlock\nand upgrade a team of minifigs to explore and do battle while reconstructing\nPiptown, the game's setting. The game is free to play, but some 'grinding'\n(performing repetitive tasks) may be required to avoid in-app purchases.\n\nOur rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSOCIAL\n\nMessenger for iOS\n\n[www.messenger.com](http://www.messenger.com)\n\n9\n\nApp updates often add more features but they can also make the app a lot\nbigger as a result. However, Facebook appears to have reversed this trend with\nthe latest update (codenamed Project LightSpeed) for Messenger. The aim here\nis downsizing - making the app faster, smaller and simpler. According to the\napp's developers (bit.ly/mess497), Messenger's code has been completely\nrebuilt and simplified by around 84%, making the app about a quarter of its\noriginal size and around twice as fast. The update is available for iOS but\nthere's currently no information as to when Android users can expect a similar\nstreamlining exercise.\n\nOur rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMUSIC\n\nSpotify for iOS\n\nbit.ly/spotify497\n\n11\n\nSpotify has also implemented a new streamlined look for its mobile app, aimed\nat making the interface simpler and easier to navigate. The update (currently\nonly available for iOS users, with an Android equivalent \"coming soon\")\nintroduces a new dual-action Play button that incorporates Shuffle Play as a\nkind of sub-button, making it easier to start streaming with a single tap.\nThere's also a new set of icons incorporated into a toolbar, which Spotify\ncalls its Action Row. Actions such as 'like', 'play' and 'download' are now\ngrouped in a central part of the screen, making the app much easier to use\none-handed.\n\nOur rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNEW APPS WORTH PAYING FOR\n\nTOOLS\n\nAutosync\n\nbit.ly/auto497\n\nPrice: \u00a36.99\n\n(varies)\n\nThis handy tool lets you sync folders on your device with folders from cloud-\nstorage accounts. Autosync is currently free to try but it requires payment\nwhen the trial expires.\n\nTOOLS\n\nTetrd Pro\n\nbit.ly/tetrd497\n\nPrice: \u00a35.49\n\n4.1\n\nIf your device doesn't support tethering, then this app lets you share its\ninternet connection with your PC (and vice versa) through a USB cable. There's\nalso a free time-limited version available.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nSpelling Shed\n\nbit.ly/spellingdroid497\n\nbit.ly/spellingios497\n\nPrice: \u00a32.99\n\n9\n\nNew on Android, this educational app is designed by teachers and used in\nschools worldwide. It gamifies learning to help kids improve their spelling\nand have some fun at the same time.\n\nTOOLS\n\nRandom Reminder\n\nbit.ly/random497\n\nPrice: 99p\n\n4.1\n\nEver feel daunted by long to-do list and reminder notifications? Then this\ncould be a useful alternative. Just create a list of tasks and press a button\nwhenever you need your memory jogged.\n\nGAME\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nbit.ly/castle497\n\nPrice: \u00a32.99\n\n4.4 #9\n\nOne of the greatest console games of all time comes to iOS and Android.\nRediscover Dracula's castle on your phone or tablet - if you've never played\nit before, you're in for a treat. The app supports controllers, too.\n\nInstall this app...\n\nRuler\n\nbit.ly/ruler497\n\n4.1\n\nSome measuring apps boast flashy augmented-reality abilities but, as our 'Not\nthis' app proves, these can often result in measurements you can't trust.\nRuler, on the other hand, takes a simple idea - turning your phone screen into\na virtual ruler - and finesses it. The interface is clean and well designed,\nyou can choose between cm, mm or inches, and there are four different\nmeasuring modes to choose from: point, line, plane and level. Most important\nof all, your measurements will all be accurate. Ruler's occasional full-screen\nads are a little annoying but, if you like the app, you can banish these with\na mere \u00a31.19.\n\n...Not this one\n\nMeasure Tools - AR Ruler\n\nbit.ly/measure497\n\nAugmented reality can be brilliant when it's used well but, sadly, that's not\nthe case here. The idea is to measure things in the real world using a virtual\nmeasuring tape, but the app's results are inconsistent (which makes it\ncompletely useless) and - as one disgruntled user points out in a Google Play\nreview - the adverts are so invasive that they actually cover up the app\nbuttons at the bottom of the screen.",

These days, however, the format has been democratised since most of us carry a high-quality HD (or even 4K) video camera in our pockets. This makes it easy for small businesses and individuals to get great shots to promote themselves - or just show off on social media.</p>\n<p>However, filming the footage is one thing - making it look like a proper piece of promotion is another skill altogether. That's why video-streaming service Vimeo has released this new app. Vimeo Create is fresh out of beta and it allows users to make professional-looking promo clips, either by starting with some of Vimeo's pre-built templates or by building one from scratch using your own footage.</p>\n<p>Creating videos is a simple, step-by-step process - just select your clips, add a cool-looking style, then layer on some music and let the tool's smart video creator do the rest. The results can be pretty attention-grabbing, and you can tweak any elements that aren't quite to your liking.</p>\n<p>The app is completely free to download and use but, If you're not already signed up to one of Vimeo's paid-for subscription services, you'll need to upgrade your membership to save and publish your clips to Vimeo's streaming platform. Vimeo Pro costs &#163;16 per month, though one way to get around this is to use the 30-day free trial you get when you first sign up. It's also worth noting that some features, including adding logos and branding to your clips, require Vimeo's more expensive (&#163;40 per month) Business subscription.</p>\n<p>Our rating &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>MINI WORKSHOP</p>\n<p>Create professional videos with Vimeo Create</p>\n<p>1 Launch Vimeo Create and you'll be asked to join: if you don't have an account, choose one of the options to sign up; if you do, tap the small 'Log in' option at the bottom of the screen or tap Skip (topright) to use the tool without signing in for now. You'll be taken to the main screen, where you can choose or search &#1042; for predesigned templates |2 that you can customise.</p>\n<p>2 To create a video from scratch, tap the green plus-sign (+) icon, then press Allow to let Vimeo Create access videos and other media stored on your device. Give your video a name and tap OK. At the top of the screen, press the 'Camera roll', Stock, Google Photos or Uploads tabs IT to select your source, then browse for a clip you want and tap its thumbnail. |2 Tap Next. &#8539;</p>\n<p>3 Press Add on the next screen to add further clips or text. Vimeo Business users can also add branding here. For the time being, just tap Next, then select a Style from the pre-built selection and tap Next again. You'll be offered a selection of licensed tunes to accompany your video. Press the Play icon |1 to hear them, then tap the thumbnail 12 to select the tune you want to use and tap Create.

Initially, there was some confusion as to whether this was just a bug, but then Google appeared to confirm that it was an intentional feature change. Either way, it hasn't been particularly well received and we've heard rumours that Google might be bringing the feature back. Until then, this app could be the answer - it shows a notification each time an app is installed or updated on your device.</p>\n<p>Our rating &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>GAME</p>\n<p><person>Chess Ace</person></p>\n<p>bit. ly/ chessdroid497</p>\n<p>bit.ly/chessios497</p>\n<p>#4.4 4 9</p>\n<p>Love chess? Enjoy playing cards? Well, now you can do both, thanks to this clever game. It's basically a puzzle where you're tasked with navigating a 5 x 5 chessboard using a limited number of chess moves, with the aim being to collect all the clubs on the board. Things start off simple but soon get challenging. <person>Chess Ace</person> offers 250 levels and several different skins to choose from. You can unlock 'ranked play', to compare your achievements with others, after you've completed a certain number of levels.</p>\n<p>Our rating &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>Lego Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</p>\n<p>bit.ly/legodroid497</p>\n<p>bit.ly/legoios497</p>\n<p>44.4&#171;9</p>\n<p><org>Lego</org> minifigures are eminently collectible, which may be one of the drivers for developing this new mobile game. Heroes Unboxed is part role-playing game and part collect-'em-up, with heavy shades of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2533474332\">Pokemon</org>. The idea is to unlock and upgrade a team of minifigs to explore and do battle while reconstructing Piptown, the game's setting. The game is free to play, but some 'grinding' (performing repetitive tasks) may be required to avoid in-app purchases.</p>\n<p>Our rating &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>SOCIAL</p>\n<p>Messenger for iOS</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.messenger.com\">www.messenger.com</a></p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p>App updates often add more features but they can also make the app a lot bigger as a result. However, Facebook appears to have reversed this trend with the latest update (codenamed Project LightSpeed) for Messenger. The aim here is downsizing - making the app faster, smaller and simpler. According to the app's developers (bit.ly/mess497), Messenger's code has been completely rebuilt and simplified by around 84%, making the app about a quarter of its original size and around twice as fast. The update is available for iOS but there's currently no information as to when Android users can expect a similar streamlining exercise.</p>\n<p>Our rating &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>MUSIC</p>\n<p>Spotify for iOS</p>\n<p>bit.ly/spotify497</p>\n<p>11</p>\n<p>Spotify has also implemented a new streamlined look for its mobile app, aimed at making the interface simpler and easier to navigate. The update (currently only available for iOS users, with an Android equivalent \"coming soon\") introduces a new dual-action Play button that incorporates Shuffle Play as a kind of sub-button, making it easier to start streaming with a single tap. There's also a new set of icons incorporated into a toolbar, which Spotify calls its <location>Action Row</location>. Actions such as 'like', 'play' and 'download' are now grouped in a central part of the screen, making the app much easier to use one-handed.</p>\n<p>Our rating &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>NEW APPS WORTH PAYING FOR</p>\n<p>TOOLS</p>\n<p>Autosync</p>\n<p>bit.ly/auto497</p>\n<p>Price: &#163;6.99</p>\n<p>(varies)</p>\n<p>This handy tool lets you sync folders on your device with folders from cloud-storage accounts.

Rediscover Dracula's castle on your phone or tablet - if you've never played it before, you're in for a treat. The app supports controllers, too.</p>\n<p>Install this app...</p>\n<p>Ruler</p>\n<p>bit.ly/ruler497</p>\n<p>4.1</p>\n<p>Some measuring apps boast flashy augmented-reality abilities but, as our 'Not this' app proves, these can often result in measurements you can't trust. Ruler, on the other hand, takes a simple idea - turning your phone screen into a virtual ruler - and finesses it. The interface is clean and well designed, you can choose between cm, mm or inches, and there are four different measuring modes to choose from: point, line, plane and level. Most important of all, your measurements will all be accurate. Ruler's occasional full-screen ads are a little annoying but, if you like the app, you can banish these with a mere &#163;1.19.</p>\n<p>...Not this one</p>\n<p>Measure Tools - AR Ruler</p>\n<p>bit.ly/measure497</p>\n<p>Augmented reality can be brilliant when it's used well but, sadly, that's not the case here. The idea is to measure things in the real world using a virtual measuring tape, but the app's results are inconsistent (which makes it completely useless) and - as one disgruntled user points out in a Google Play review - the adverts are so invasive that they actually cover up the app buttons at the bottom of the screen.</p>",
