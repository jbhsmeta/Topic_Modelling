    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY \\- Oklahoma is on its way to having its own Imagination Library\n\\- a literacy program providing free books to encourage children to read.\n\nSen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, and Rep Tammy Townley, R-Ardmore, are\nprincipal authors of SB 1803, creating the framework for Oklahoma's\nImagination Library, modeled after a program founded by entertainer Dolly\nParton in her home state of Tennessee. The governor signed the measure into\nlaw on Thursday.\n\n\"The Imagination Library is a public/private partnership that will mail every\nsingle child in Oklahoma one high-quality, age appropriate book a month from\nbirth through age five, with no restrictions or financial limits for families\nto participate,\" Haste said. \"This program has been proven to increase reading\ntime, increase kindergarten readiness and is credited with helping children\nscore higher on reading tests.\"\n\nSB 1803 creates a revolving fund for Oklahoma's Imagination Library and places\nadministration under the State Department of Education. Haste said the first\nbook mailed to each Oklahoma child will be \"The Little Engine that Could.\"\n\nHaste said he was inspired to begin an Imagination Library after attending a\nmeeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Tennessee in 2019,\nwhich included a presentation with Parton. She founded the Imagination Library\nin 1995 for the children in Sevier County, Tennessee, with the program later\nexpanding throughout the entire state. Today, Parton's Imagination Library has\npartners in communities throughout the country, with statewide programs in\nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Arkansas and Delaware and has been adopted in Australia,\nCanada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Reading is the basis for all learning,\" Townley said. \"Inspiring a love of\nreading in children at an early age will help better prepare them to become\nlife-long learners and give them a leg up when they start school. I'm thankful\nto have worked with Senator Haste to bring this program to Oklahoma and I look\nforward to seeing the impact this will have on our school-age children.\"",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.oklcty\">OKLAHOMA CITY</location> - <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma</location> is on its way to having its own <org>Imagination Library</org> - a literacy program providing free books to encourage children to read.</p>\n<p>Sen. <person>John Haste</person>, R-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.brorow\">Broken Arrow</location>, and Rep <person>Tammy Townley</person>, R-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.ardore\">Ardmore</location>, are principal authors of SB 1803, creating the framework for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma's</location> <org>Imagination Library</org>, modeled after a program founded by entertainer <person>Dolly Parton</person> in her home state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tn\">Tennessee</location>. The governor signed the measure into law on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>\"<org>The Imagination Library</org> is a public/private partnership that will mail every single child in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma</location> one high-quality, age appropriate book a month from birth through age five, with no restrictions or financial limits for families to participate,\" Haste said. \"This program has been proven to increase reading time, increase kindergarten readiness and is credited with helping children score higher on reading tests.\"</p>\n\n<p>SB 1803 creates a revolving fund for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma's</location> <org>Imagination Library</org> and places administration under the <org>State Department of Education</org>. Haste said the first book mailed to each <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma</location> child will be \"The Little Engine that Could.\"</p>\n\n<p>Haste said he was inspired to begin an <org>Imagination Library</org> after attending a meeting of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3844679936\">National Conference of State Legislatures</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tn\">Tennessee</location> in 2019, which included a presentation with Parton. She founded the <org>Imagination Library</org> in 1995 for the children in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.sevier\">Sevier County, Tennessee</location>, with the program later expanding throughout the entire state. Today, Parton's <org>Imagination Library</org> has partners in communities throughout the country, with statewide programs in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ar\">Arkansas</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.de\">Delaware</location> and has been adopted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ie\">Republic of Ireland</location> and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Reading is the basis for all learning,\" Townley said. \"Inspiring a love of reading in children at an early age will help better prepare them to become life-long learners and give them a leg up when they start school. I'm thankful to have worked with <person>Senator Haste</person> to bring this program to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma</location> and I look forward to seeing the impact this will have on our school-age children.\"</p>",
