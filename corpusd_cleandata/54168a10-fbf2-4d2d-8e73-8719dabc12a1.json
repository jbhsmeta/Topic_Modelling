    "text": "## President's Commission on Carbon Neutrality releases second interim report,\nenters final phase\n\nThursday, June 4, 2020 \\- 9:05pm\n\nJulianna Morano Daily Staff Reporter\n\nThursday morning, the President's Commission on Carbon Neutrality released its\nsecond interim report, summarizing the research and analysis tasked to a\nnumber of specialized teams in the second phase of its work. University of\nMichigan President Mark Schlissel launched the commission in February 2019 to\ncreate a plan for the University to become carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\n\"The goal of the President's Commission on Carbon Neutrality is to contribute\nto a more sustainable and just world by creating approaches and solutions\nregarding U-M carbon emissions that are environmentally sustainable, involve\nthe regional community, and can be scaled and replicated beyond U-M,\" the\nreport says.\n\nAfter the planning stage, internal and external teams consisting of faculty,\nstaff, students and consulting firms analyzed emissions associated with\nUniversity-sponsored travel and formulated new building codes aimed at\nreducing carbon emissions. These would assist the University in identifying\nareas to reduce its carbon footprint, according to the report. The report also\nfeatured the teams' proposals of potential pathways for the University to\npursue in its efforts toward carbon neutrality.\n\n\"Phase Two work, which took place from November 2019 through June 2020,\ninvolved a range of technical analyses to inform the Commission's\nrecommendations,\" the report reads. \"This shared knowledge informed feedback\nto the analysis teams and will continue to be helpful when deliberations take\nplace during the PCCN's third and final phase.\"\n\nOne PCCN team specialized in bio sequestration, or the \"natural ability of\nliving organisms to capture carbon.\" They analyzed the University's\nlandholdings, such as the Biological Station and Matthaei Botanical Gardens,\nwith the purpose of evaluating possible land-use changes to maximize the\npotential of bio sequestration. The team also considered methods to\nfamiliarize the University community with bio sequestration.\n\n\"Small scale projects were explored as a potential way to bring the likely\nunfamiliar ideas of bio sequestration to U-M's three campuses in a more\ntangible and visible way,\" the report reads.\n\nAnother team focused on emissions associated with commuting to the\nUniversity's campuses explored parking policies and public transit options in\nAnn Arbor, Dearborn and Flint, as well the potential for more affordable on-\ncampus housing to reduce emissions associated with commuting. The team engaged\nwith the University community directly to inform its recommendations with a\ngrasp of the current state of transportation on the University's campuses.\n\n\"The work was informed by engagement with a variety of external and internal\nstakeholders to understand the existing policies surrounding transportation\nand commuting through town halls on the U- M Ann Arbor campus, and on the U-M\nDearborn campus,\" the report reads. \"Unfortunately, a planned town hall at U-M\nFlint had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis. A survey was distributed\nto U-M community members across all three campuses to inform their\nrecommendations.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis had various impacts on the commission, after the first\nconfirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the U.S. a little over two months\ninto the commission's second phase. The report identified several canceled\npublic engagements amid the COVID-19 crisis. The report also highlighted\ndigital forms of engagement offered on PCCN's website, including a comments\nportal which the report said received 175 submissions.\n\n\"Even as the University of Michigan (U-M) and the world confront the immediate\ncrisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains a critical challenge\nand a priority for U-M,\" the report reads.\n\nEngineering Professor Stephen Forrest and Michigan Law Professor Jennifer\nHaverkamp co-chair the commission. They commented on the effects of the\npandemic on the commission's timeline in an email to The Daily.\n\n\"As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted workflows across U-M, the President's\nCommission on Carbon Neutrality granted internal analysis teams extensions to\nprovide enough time for them to complete their work,\" Forrest and Haverkamp\nsaid. \"In most cases, however, teams had finished or nearly finished their\nanalyses around the onset of the pandemic in Michigan.\"\n\nThe co-chairs also commented on challenges the commission will experience\nmoving into its third phase of work.\n\n\"COVID-19 presents U-M with unprecedented adjustments, and the commission\nfaces new restrictions on future travel and the use of external consultants,\"\nForrest and Haverkamp said. \"The commission will consider how to best organize\nits work and consult with external experts going forward, as it progresses\ntoward defining recommendations for U-M to achieve carbon neutrality.\"\n\nThe third and final phase of the commission's work is set to launch in July\nand conclude in December. The commission will draft a set of recommendations\nto be published for public comment before being finalized and submitted to\nPresident Schlissel.\n\n_Daily Staff Reporter Julianna Morano can be reached\nat[jucomora@umich.edu](mailto:jucomora@umich.edu)._",

These would assist the University in identifying areas to reduce its carbon footprint, according to the report. The report also featured the teams&#8217; proposals of potential pathways for the University to pursue in its efforts toward carbon neutrality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Phase Two work, which took place from <chron>November 2019</chron> through <chron>June 2020</chron>, involved a range of technical analyses to inform the Commission&#8217;s recommendations,&#8221; the report reads. &#8220;This shared knowledge informed feedback to the analysis teams and will continue to be helpful when deliberations take place during the PCCN&#8217;s third and final phase.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One PCCN team specialized in bio sequestration, or the &#8220;natural ability of living organisms to capture carbon.&#8221; They analyzed the University&#8217;s landholdings, such as the <location>Biological Station</location> and <location>Matthaei Botanical Gardens</location>, with the purpose of evaluating possible land-use changes to maximize the potential of bio sequestration. The team also considered methods to familiarize the University community with bio sequestration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Small scale projects were explored as a potential way to bring the likely unfamiliar ideas of bio sequestration to U-M&#8217;s three campuses in a more tangible and visible way,&#8221; the report reads.</p>\n<p>Another team focused on emissions associated with commuting to the University&#8217;s campuses explored parking policies and public transit options in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.annarb\">Ann Arbor</location>, Dearborn and Flint, as well the potential for more affordable on-campus housing to reduce emissions associated with commuting. The team engaged with the University community directly to inform its recommendations with a grasp of the current state of transportation on the University&#8217;s campuses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The work was informed by engagement with a variety of external and internal stakeholders to understand the existing policies surrounding transportation and commuting through town halls on the U- M Ann Arbor campus, and on the U-<person>M Dearborn</person> campus,&#8221; the report reads. &#8220;Unfortunately, a planned town hall at U-<person>M Flint</person> had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis. A survey was distributed to U-M community members across all three campuses to inform their recommendations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis had various impacts on the commission, after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> a little over two months into the commission&#8217;s second phase. The report identified several canceled public engagements amid the COVID-19 crisis. The report also highlighted digital forms of engagement offered on PCCN&#8217;s website, including a comments portal which the report said received 175 submissions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even as the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1014138747\">University of Michigan</org> (U-M) and the world confront the immediate crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains a critical challenge and a priority for U-M,&#8221; the report reads.</p>\n<p>Engineering Professor <person>Stephen Forrest</person> and Michigan Law Professor <person>Jennifer Haverkamp</person> co-chair the commission. They commented on the effects of the pandemic on the commission&#8217;s timeline in an email to The Daily.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted workflows across U-M, the President's <org>Commission on Carbon Neutrality</org> granted internal analysis teams extensions to provide enough time for them to complete their work,&#8221; Forrest and Haverkamp said. &#8220;In most cases, however, teams had finished or nearly finished their analyses around the onset of the pandemic in Michigan.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The co-chairs also commented on challenges the commission will experience moving into its third phase of work.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;COVID-19 presents U-M with unprecedented adjustments, and the commission faces new restrictions on future travel and the use of external consultants,&#8221; Forrest and Haverkamp said. &#8220;The commission will consider how to best organize its work and consult with external experts going forward, as it progresses toward defining recommendations for U-M to achieve carbon neutrality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The third and final phase of the commission&#8217;s work is set to launch in July and conclude in December. The commission will draft a set of recommendations to be published for public comment before being finalized and submitted to <person>President Schlissel</person>.&#160;</p>\n<p><em>Daily Staff Reporter Julianna Morano can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:jucomora@umich.edu\">jucomora@umich.edu</a>.</em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>",
