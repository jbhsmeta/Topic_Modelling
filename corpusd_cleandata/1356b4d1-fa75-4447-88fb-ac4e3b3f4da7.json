    "text": "NEW YORK, June 5 \\-- The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\\- New York-New Jersey Regional Information Office issued the following report\non the occupational employment and wages in Vineland-Bridgeton for May 2019:\n\nWorkers in the Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area had an\naverage (mean) hourly wage of $23.51 in May 2019, about 9 percent below the\nnationwide average of $25.72, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.\nChief Regional Economist Martin Kohli noted that, after testing for\nstatistical significance, wages in the local area were higher than their\nrespective national averages in 3 of the 22 major occupational groups:\nhealthcare practitioners and technical, protective service, and healthcare\nsupport. Eleven groups had significantly lower wages than their respective\nnational averages, including computer and mathematical; legal; and arts,\ndesign, entertainment, sports, and media.\n\nWhen compared to the nationwide distribution, Vineland area employment was\nmore highly concentrated in 6 of the 22 occupational groups, including\ntransportation and material moving, protective service, and production.\nConversely, twelve groups had employment shares significantly below their\nnational representation, including food preparation and serving related,\nbusiness and financial operations, and management. (See table A and box note\nat end of release.)\n\nOne occupational group--transportation and material moving--was chosen to\nillustrate the diversity of data available for any of the 22 major\noccupational categories. Vineland had 8,730 jobs in transportation and\nmaterial moving, accounting for 14.4 percent of local area employment,\nsignificantly higher than the 8.5-percent share nationally. The average hourly\nwage for this occupational group locally was $16.13, significantly below the\nnational wage of $18.23.\n\nSome of the larger detailed occupations within the transportation and material\nmoving group included laborers and freight, stock, and material movers, hand\n(2,240), heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers (1,240), and packers and\npackagers, hand (1,150). Among the higher-paying jobs in this group were\nfirst-line supervisors of transportation and material moving workers, except\naircraft cargo handling, and heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers, with\nmean hourly wages of $28.15 and $23.20, respectively. At the lower end of the\nwage scale were automotive and watercraft service attendants ($9.88) and\nlaborers and freight, stock, and material movers, hand ($12.33). (Detailed\ndata for the transportation and material moving occupations are presented in\ntable 1; for a complete listing of detailed occupations available go to\n[www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_47220.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_47220.htm)\n.)\n\nLocation quotients allow us to explore the occupational make-up of a\nmetropolitan area by comparing the composition of jobs in an area relative to\nthe national average. (See table 1.) For example, a location quotient of 2.0\nindicates that an occupation accounts for twice the share of employment in the\narea than it does nationally. In the Vineland area, above-average\nconcentrations of employment were found in many of the occupations within the\ntransportation and material moving group. For instance, packers and packagers,\nhand were employed at 4.4 times the national rate in Vineland, and passenger\nvehicle drivers, except bus drivers, transit and intercity, at 2.8 times the\nU.S. average. Stockers and order fillers had a location quotient of 1.1 in\nVineland, indicating that this particular occupation's local and national\nemployment shares were similar.\n\nThese statistics are from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey,\na federal-state cooperative program between BLS and State Workforce Agencies,\nin this case, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development.\n\n* Changes to the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Data\n\nWith the May 2019 estimates, the OES program has begun implementing the 2018\nStandard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. Each set of OES estimates\nis calculated from six panels of survey data collected over three years.\nBecause the May 2019 estimates are based on a combination of survey data\ncollected using the 2010 SOC and survey data collected using the 2018 SOC,\nthese estimates use a hybrid of the two classification systems that contains\nsome combinations of occupations that are not found in either the 2010 or 2018\nSOC. These combinations may include occupations from more than one 2018 SOC\nminor group or broad occupation. Therefore, OES will not publish data for some\n2018 SOC minor groups and broad occupations in the May 2019 estimates. The May\n2021 estimates, to be published in Spring 2022, will be the first OES\nestimates based entirely on survey data collected using the 2018 SOC.\n\nIn addition, the OES program has replaced some 2018 SOC detailed occupations\nwith SOC broad occupations or OES-specific aggregations. These include home\nhealth aides and personal care aides, for which OES will publish only the 2018\nSOC broad occupation 31-1120 Home Health and Personal Care Aides.\n\nFor more information on the occupational classification system used in the May\n2019 OES estimates, please see\n[www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm) and\nwww.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm#qf10.\n\nThe May 2019 OES estimates use the metropolitan area definitions delineated in\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin 17-01, which add a new\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for Twin Falls, Idaho. For more\ninformation on the area definitions used in the May 2019 estimates, please see\n[www.bls.gov/oes/current/msa_def.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/msa_def.htm).\n\n* Technical Note\n\nThe Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey is a semiannual survey\nmeasuring occupational employment and wage rates for wage and salary workers\nin nonfarm establishments in the United States. The OES data available from\nBLS include cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the\nnation; over 580 areas, including states and the District of Columbia,\nmetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), nonmetropolitan areas, and territories;\nnational industry-specific estimates at the NAICS sector, 3-digit, most\n4-digit, and selected 5- and 6-digit industry levels, and national estimates\nby ownership across all industries and for schools and hospitals. OES data are\navailable at [www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm).\n\nThe OES survey is a cooperative effort between BLS and the State Workforce\nAgencies (SWAs). BLS funds the survey and provides the procedures and\ntechnical support, while the State Workforce Agencies collect most of the\ndata. OES estimates are constructed from a sample of about 1.1 million\nestablishments. Each year, two semiannual panels of approximately 180,000 to\n200,000 sampled establishments are contacted, one panel in May and the other\nin November. Responses are obtained by mail, Internet or other electronic\nmeans, email, telephone, or personal visit. The May 2019 estimates are based\non responses from six semiannual panels collected over a 3-year period: May\n2019, November 2018, May 2018, November 2017, May 2017, and November 2016. The\nunweighted sample employment of 83 million across all six semiannual panels\nrepresents approximately 57 percent of total national employment. The overall\nnational response rate for the six panels, based on the 50 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia, is 71 percent based on establishments and 68 percent\nbased on weighted sampled employment. The sample in the Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ\nMetropolitan Statistical Area included 831 establishments with a response rate\nof 82 percent. For more information about OES concepts and methodology, go to\n[www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_tec.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_tec.htm).\n\nA value that is statistically different from another does not necessarily mean\nthat the difference has economic or practical significance. Statistical\nsignificance is concerned with the ability to make confident statements about\na universe based on a sample. It is entirely possible that a large difference\nbetween two values is not significantly different statistically, while a small\ndifference is, since both the size and heterogeneity of the sample affect the\nrelative error of the data being tested.\n\nThe May 2019 OES estimates are the first set of OES estimates to be based in\npart on survey data collected using the 2018 SOC. These estimates use a hybrid\nof the 2010 and 2018 SOC systems. More information on the hybrid\nclassification system is available at\n[www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm).\n\nThe May 2019 OES estimates are based on the 2017 North American Industry\nClassification System (NAICS). More information about the 2017 NAICS is\navailable at [www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm](http://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm).\n\n* Metropolitan area definitions\n\nThe substate area data published in this release reflect the standards and\ndefinitions established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe Vineland-Bridgeton, NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area is comprised of\nCumberland County.\n\n* For more information\n\nAnswers to frequently asked questions about the OES data are available at\n[www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm). Detailed\ninformation about the OES program is available at\n[www.bls.gov/oes/oes_doc.htm](http://www.bls.gov/oes/oes_doc.htm).\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to sensory impaired\nindividuals upon request .

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">NEW YORK</location>, <chron>June 5</chron> -- The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1576954704\">U.S. Department of Labor's</org> <org>Bureau of Labor Statistics</org> - New York-New Jersey Regional Information Office issued the following report on the occupational employment and wages in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.vinand\">Vineland</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.briton\">Bridgeton</location> for <chron>May 2019</chron>:</p><p>Workers in the Vineland-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.briton\">Bridgeton, NJ</location> Metropolitan Statistical Area had an average (mean) hourly wage of <money>$23.51</money> in <chron>May 2019</chron>, about 9 percent below the nationwide average of <money>$25.72</money>, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2334039432\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</org> reported. Chief Regional Economist <person>Martin Kohli</person> noted that, after testing for statistical significance, wages in the local area were higher than their respective national averages in 3 of the 22 major occupational groups: healthcare practitioners and technical, protective service, and healthcare support. Eleven groups had significantly lower wages than their respective national averages, including computer and mathematical; legal; and arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media.</p><p>When compared to the nationwide distribution, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.vinand\">Vineland</location> area employment was more highly concentrated in 6 of the 22 occupational groups, including transportation and material moving, protective service, and production. Conversely, twelve groups had employment shares significantly below their national representation, including food preparation and serving related, business and financial operations, and management. (See table A and box note at end of release.)</p><p>One occupational group--transportation and material moving--was chosen to illustrate the diversity of data available for any of the 22 major occupational categories. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.vinand\">Vineland</location> had 8,730 jobs in transportation and material moving, accounting for 14.4 percent of local area employment, significantly higher than the 8.5-percent share nationally. The average hourly wage for this occupational group locally was <money>$16.13</money>, significantly below the national wage of <money>$18.23</money>.</p><p>Some of the larger detailed occupations within the transportation and material moving group included laborers and freight, stock, and material movers, hand (2,240), heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers (1,240), and packers and packagers, hand (1,150). Among the higher-paying jobs in this group were first-line supervisors of transportation and material moving workers, except aircraft cargo handling, and heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers, with mean hourly wages of <money>$28.15</money> and <money>$23.20</money>, respectively. At the lower end of the wage scale were automotive and watercraft service attendants (<money>$9.88</money>) and laborers and freight, stock, and material movers, hand (<money>$12.33</money>). (Detailed data for the transportation and material moving occupations are presented in table 1; for a complete listing of detailed occupations available go to <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_47220.htm\">www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_47220.htm</a> .)</p><p>Location quotients allow us to explore the occupational make-up of a metropolitan area by comparing the composition of jobs in an area relative to the national average. (See table 1.) For example, a location quotient of 2.0 indicates that an occupation accounts for twice the share of employment in the area than it does nationally. In the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.vinand\">Vineland</location> area, above-average concentrations of employment were found in many of the occupations within the transportation and material moving group. For instance, packers and packagers, hand were employed at 4.4 times the national rate in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.vinand\">Vineland</location>, and passenger vehicle drivers, except bus drivers, transit and intercity, at 2.8 times the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> average. Stockers and order fillers had a location quotient of 1.1 in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.vinand\">Vineland</location>, indicating that this particular occupation's local and national employment shares were similar.</p><p>These statistics are from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, a federal-state cooperative program between BLS and State Workforce Agencies, in this case, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2813890682\">New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development</org>.</p><p>* Changes to the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Data</p><p>With the <chron>May 2019</chron> estimates, the OES program has begun implementing the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. Each set of OES estimates is calculated from six panels of survey data collected over three years. Because the <chron>May 2019</chron> estimates are based on a combination of survey data collected using the 2010 SOC and survey data collected using the 2018 SOC, these estimates use a hybrid of the two classification systems that contains some combinations of occupations that are not found in either the 2010 or 2018 SOC. These combinations may include occupations from more than one 2018 SOC minor group or broad occupation. Therefore, OES will not publish data for some 2018 SOC minor groups and broad occupations in the <chron>May 2019</chron> estimates. The <chron>May 2021</chron> estimates, to be published in Spring 2022, will be the first OES estimates based entirely on survey data collected using the 2018 SOC.</p><p>In addition, the OES program has replaced some 2018 SOC detailed occupations with SOC broad occupations or OES-specific aggregations. These include home health aides and personal care aides, for which OES will publish only the 2018 SOC broad occupation 31-1120 <org>Home Health</org> and Personal Care Aides.</p><p>For more information on the occupational classification system used in the <chron>May 2019</chron> OES estimates, please see <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm\">www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm</a> and www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm#qf10.</p><p>The <chron>May 2019</chron> OES estimates use the metropolitan area definitions delineated in <org>Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin</org> 17-01, which add a new Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.twills\">Twin Falls, Idaho</location>. For more information on the area definitions used in the <chron>May 2019</chron> estimates, please see <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/msa_def.htm\">www.bls.gov/oes/current/msa_def.htm</a>.</p><p>* Technical Note</p><p>The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey is a semiannual survey measuring occupational employment and wage rates for wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. The OES data available from BLS include cross-industry occupational employment and wage estimates for the nation; over 580 areas, including states and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.dc\">District of Columbia</location>, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), nonmetropolitan areas, and territories; national industry-specific estimates at the NAICS sector, 3-digit, most 4-digit, and selected 5- and 6-digit industry levels, and national estimates by ownership across all industries and for schools and hospitals. OES data are available at <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm\">www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm</a>.</p><p>The OES survey is a cooperative effort between BLS and the State Workforce Agencies (SWAs). BLS funds the survey and provides the procedures and technical support, while the State Workforce Agencies collect most of the data. OES estimates are constructed from a sample of about 1.1 million establishments. Each year, two semiannual panels of approximately 180,000 to 200,000 sampled establishments are contacted, one panel in May and the other in November. Responses are obtained by mail, Internet or other electronic means, email, telephone, or personal visit. The <chron>May 2019</chron> estimates are based on responses from six semiannual panels collected over a 3-year period: <chron>May 2019</chron>, <chron>November 2018</chron>, <chron>May 2018</chron>, <chron>November 2017</chron>, <chron>May 2017</chron>, and <chron>November 2016</chron>. The unweighted sample employment of 83 million across all six semiannual panels represents approximately 57 percent of total national employment. The overall national response rate for the six panels, based on the 50 states and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.dc\">District of Columbia</location>, is 71 percent based on establishments and 68 percent based on weighted sampled employment. The sample in the Vineland-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.briton\">Bridgeton, NJ</location> Metropolitan Statistical Area included 831 establishments with a response rate of 82 percent.

Statistical significance is concerned with the ability to make confident statements about a universe based on a sample. It is entirely possible that a large difference between two values is not significantly different statistically, while a small difference is, since both the size and heterogeneity of the sample affect the relative error of the data being tested.</p><p>The <chron>May 2019</chron> OES estimates are the first set of OES estimates to be based in part on survey data collected using the 2018 SOC. These estimates use a hybrid of the 2010 and 2018 SOC systems. More information on the hybrid classification system is available at <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm\">www.bls.gov/oes/soc_2018.htm</a>.</p><p>The <chron>May 2019</chron> OES estimates are based on the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). More information about the 2017 NAICS is available at <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm\">www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm</a>.</p><p>* Metropolitan area definitions</p><p>The substate area data published in this release reflect the standards and definitions established by the <org>U.S. Office of Management and Budget</org>.</p><p>The Vineland-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.briton\">Bridgeton, NJ</location> Metropolitan Statistical Area is comprised of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.cumand\">Cumberland County</location>.</p><p>* For more information</p><p>Answers to frequently asked questions about the OES data are available at <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm\">www.bls.gov/oes/oes_ques.htm</a>.
