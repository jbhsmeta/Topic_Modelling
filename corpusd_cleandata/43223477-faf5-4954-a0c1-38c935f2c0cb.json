    "text": "SALISBURY - Two men were charged Sunday during a downtown protest that left\npeople scattering after a man was seen firing gunshots into the air.\n\nSalisbury Police charged Jeffery Alan Long, 49, of Kernersville, with two\ncounts of misdemeanor carrying a concealed pistol/gun, carrying a weapon at a\nparade, and one count of misdemeanor discharging a firearm in city limits. A\nnews release said police located two firearms on Long - in his waistband and\nan ankle holster. He was taken into custody at the scene, at the intersection\nof West Innes and North Church streets.\n\nAt 7 p.m., a city news release said, officers witnessed Long pull a handgun\nfrom his waistband and fire two rounds into the air from a 9 mm pistol. He put\nthe gun back in his waistband and walked away, followed by protestors, the\ncity said in a news release. Officers took Long into custody as he retreated\nfrom protesters and recovered the second handgun.\n\nA second man, Brandon Martell Walker, 33, of Ferndale Drive in Salisbury, was\ncharged with misdemeanor carrying a concealed gun, according to a warrant.\n\nThe city initially said Sunday that two men, Long and Walker, both shot near\nprotesters. But protesters said that was not the case. Arrest warrants also do\nnot support that Walker fired any shots. According to the city's statement, at\nthe same time as Long's arrest, Walker was identified to police as a person\nalso involved in the altercation but who had not discharged a firearm.\n\nAs police approached Walker in the 100 block of South Church Street to take\nhis statement, he allegedly hid behind a car and placed a 9 mm handgun under\nthe car. He and men with him were detained until Walker was arrested. The men\nwith Walker were released.\n\nWalker was issued a written promise to appear in court.\n\nProtestors gathered Saturday and Sunday in downtown Salisbury to protest the\ndeath of George Floyd, an African-American man who died a week ago after being\narrested by then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who was shown on\nvideo with his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes.\n\nFloyd died while handcuffed and lying facedown in the street. Chauvin was\nlater terminated and charged with offenses related to Floyd's death.\n\nMuch of Saturday's protests were mobile, as participants drove up and down\ndowntown Salisbury with homemade signs, wearing T-shirts and honking their\nhorns. The Sunday protest was spread throughout downtown Salisbury. The\nprotest then moved toward East Innes and Arlington streets before returning\ndowntown.",

    "html": "<p>SALISBURY - Two men were charged Sunday during a downtown protest that left people scattering after a man was seen firing gunshots into the air.</p>\n<p><org>Salisbury Police</org> charged <person>Jeffery Alan Long</person>, 49, of Kernersville, with two counts of misdemeanor carrying a concealed pistol/gun, carrying a weapon at a parade, and one count of misdemeanor discharging a firearm in city limits. A news release said police located two firearms on Long - in his waistband and an ankle holster. He was taken into custody at the scene, at the intersection of West Innes and North Church streets.</p>\n\n<p>At <chron>7 p.m.</chron>, a city news release said, officers witnessed Long pull a handgun from his waistband and fire two rounds into the air from a 9 mm pistol. He put the gun back in his waistband and walked away, followed by protestors, the city said in a news release. Officers took Long into custody as he retreated from protesters and recovered the second handgun.</p>\n\n<p>A second man, <person>Brandon Martell Walker</person>, 33, of <location>Ferndale Drive</location> in Salisbury, was charged with misdemeanor carrying a concealed gun, according to a warrant.</p>\n\n<p>The city initially said Sunday that two men, Long and Walker, both shot near protesters. But protesters said that was not the case. Arrest warrants also do not support that Walker fired any shots. According to the city's statement, at the same time as Long's arrest, Walker was identified to police as a person also involved in the altercation but who had not discharged a firearm.</p>\n\n<p>As police approached Walker in the 100 block of <location>South Church Street</location> to take his statement, he allegedly hid behind a car and placed a 9 mm handgun under the car. He and men with him were detained until Walker was arrested. The men with Walker were released.</p>\n\n<p>Walker was issued a written promise to appear in court.</p>\n\n<p>Protestors gathered Saturday and Sunday in downtown Salisbury to protest the death of <person>George Floyd</person>, an <org>African-American</org> man who died a week ago after being arrested by then-<org>Minneapolis Police</org> Officer <person>Derek Chauvin</person>, who was shown on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd died while handcuffed and lying facedown in the street. Chauvin was later terminated and charged with offenses related to Floyd's death.</p>\n\n<p>Much of Saturday's protests were mobile, as participants drove up and down downtown Salisbury with homemade signs, wearing T-shirts and honking their horns. The Sunday protest was spread throughout downtown Salisbury. The protest then moved toward East Innes and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.arlton\">Arlington</location> streets before returning downtown.</p>",
