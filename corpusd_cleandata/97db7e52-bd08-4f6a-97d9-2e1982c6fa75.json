    "text": "A man whose defence lawyer says has turned his life around during the last\nthree years pleaded guilty on Thursday to getting blackout drunk and stealing\nhis neighbour's guitar.\n\nJonathan Mini, 24, pleaded guilty to break and enter with theft for an Aug.\n21, 2017, incident when he was living at Massey Manor.\n\nCrown attorney Deidre Badcock said he was living in one of the emergency\nshelter units at the time of the offence.\n\nSecurity camera footage shows Mini leaving the building at 7:37 p.m. to use\nthe trash containers located across the street. When he returns from the\ncontainers, he is seen climbing in through the window of the unit next to his.\nTwo minutes later, he re-emerges from the same window carrying a guitar case.\n\nThe next day, the victim reported that when he returned home it looked as\nthough someone had been inside, and his Fender guitar, valued at approximately\n$1,000, was missing. He said he hadn't given the unit's passcode to anyone, so\ndidn't know how anyone got inside.\n\nHe contacted the Canadian Mental Health Association (now the Community Health\nand Housing Association), which operates housing in Massey Manor, to report\nthe thefts, Badcock said.\n\nAfter watching the surveillance video, a staff member said she recognized Mini\nin the footage. Badcock said Mini gave back the guitar when he was confronted,\nsaying he was blackout drunk at the time and didn't know where he got it from.\n\nWhile the guitar was returned, Badcock said it doesn't excuse stealing it in\nthe first place.\n\n\"(The victim) is someone who was down on his luck, in emergency shelter\nhousing, and someone takes advantage of that and takes the only real prized\npossession he has,\" Badcock said.\n\n\"It's not a matter of Mr. Mini realizing his mistake and returning the\nproperty forthwith, it was someone who had to be confronted and once\nconfronted gave the property back.\"\n\nShe also raised the issue that the case has dragged on for almost three years,\nsaying Mini has had issues attending court in the past.\n\nMini has since turned his life around, said his defence lawyer, Patrick\nSullivan. He had two kids with his partner and is working to complete high\nschool.\n\nSullivan said Mini has also been sober since 2018 and has a sponsor through\nAlcoholics Anonymous. While he is currently unemployed, he is volunteering\nwith Brandon Bear Clan.\n\n\"He has expressed remorse with respect to this crime,\" Sullivan said. \"This\nwas a crime of opportunity, no one was present in the home, no damage done to\nthe suite.\"\n\nSullivan suggested a sentence of time already served in jail -- approximately\nfour months -- and a lengthy probation.\n\nJudge Donovan Dvorak said it does appear Mini had taken positive steps to\nimprove his life and make real changes. He sentenced him to time already\nserved, two years of probation and a 10-year ban on owning guns.\n\n\"Certainly if you fall back into your old ways and come back before the court\nor anything like this, expect substantial period of custody,\" Dvorak said.\n\n\"I'm hoping and I believe that we're not going to see you, but understand if\nwe do there will be some consequences for you.\"\n\n\u00bb [dmay@brandonsun.com](mailto:dmay@brandonsun.com)\n\n\u00bb Twitter: @DrewMay_",

    "html": "<p>A man whose defence lawyer says has turned his life around during the last three years pleaded guilty on Thursday to getting blackout drunk and stealing his neighbour&#8217;s guitar.</p><p><person>Jonathan Mini</person>, 24, pleaded guilty to break and enter with theft for an <chron>Aug. 21, 2017</chron>, incident when he was living at <location>Massey Manor</location>.</p><p>Crown attorney <person>Deidre Badcock</person> said he was living in one of the emergency shelter units at the time of the offence.</p><p>Security camera footage shows Mini leaving the building at <chron>7:37 p.m.</chron> to use the trash containers located across the street. When he returns from the containers, he is seen climbing in through the window of the unit next to his. Two minutes later, he re-emerges from the same window carrying a guitar case.</p><p>The next day, the victim reported that when he returned home it looked as though someone had been inside, and his Fender guitar, valued at approximately <span>$</span>1,000, was missing. He said he hadn&#8217;t given the unit&#8217;s passcode to anyone, so didn&#8217;t know how anyone got inside.</p><p>He contacted the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4236145718\">Canadian Mental Health Association</org> (now the <org>Community Health and Housing Association</org>), which operates housing in <location>Massey Manor</location>, to report the thefts, Badcock said.</p><p>After watching the surveillance video, a staff member said she recognized Mini in the footage. Badcock said Mini gave back the guitar when he was confronted, saying he was blackout drunk at the time and didn&#8217;t know where he got it from.</p><p>While the guitar was returned, Badcock said it doesn&#8217;t excuse stealing it in the first place.</p><p>&#8220;(The victim) is someone who was down on his luck, in emergency shelter housing, and someone takes advantage of that and takes the only real prized possession he has,&#8221; Badcock said.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of <person>Mr. Mini</person> realizing his mistake and returning the property forthwith, it was someone who had to be confronted and once confronted gave the property back.&#8221;</p><p>She also raised the issue that the case has dragged on for almost three years, saying Mini has had issues attending court in the past.</p><p>Mini has since turned his life around, said his defence lawyer, <person>Patrick Sullivan</person>. He had two kids with his partner and is working to complete high school.</p><p>Sullivan said Mini has also been sober since 2018 and has a sponsor through <org>Alcoholics Anonymous</org>. While he is currently unemployed, he is volunteering with Brandon Bear Clan.</p><p>&#8220;He has expressed remorse with respect to this crime,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;This was a crime of opportunity, no one was present in the home, no damage done to the suite.&#8221;</p><p>Sullivan suggested a sentence of time already served in jail &#8212; approximately four months &#8212; and a lengthy probation.</p><p>Judge <person>Donovan Dvorak</person> said it does appear Mini had taken positive steps to improve his life and make real changes. He sentenced him to time already served, two years of probation and a 10-year ban on owning guns.</p><p>&#8220;Certainly if you fall back into your old ways and come back before the court or anything like this, expect substantial period of custody,&#8221; Dvorak said.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping and I believe that we&#8217;re not going to see you, but understand if we do there will be some consequences for you.&#8221;</p><p>&#187; <a href=\"mailto:dmay@brandonsun.com\">dmay@brandonsun.com</a></p><p>&#187; Twitter: @DrewMay_</p>",
