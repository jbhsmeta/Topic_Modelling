    "text": "Plans for the demolition of garages in a key business district of Ipswich have\nbeen given the go-ahead, paving the way for a future \u00a37million transformation\nof the area.\n\nIpswich Borough Council's planning committee gave the green light for the\nauthority to knock down the old Aspire Cars and Avanti Autos garages in\nPrinces Street at its virtual planning meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn the short term, those sites will be used as temporary car parks along with\nthe old Drum and Monkey site but have been earmarked for a major \u00a37m\ntransformation in the Princes Street business corridor.\n\nIt emerged last year that a hotel chain were interested in the Drum and Monkey\nsite, while an office block is expected on the garages site.\n\nIn its application the council said: \"The building is in a poor state of\nrepair and currently has a negative impact on the character and appearance of\nthe immediate surrounding area.\n\n\"Its demolition in advance of the construction of replacement buildings is\nseen as a positive impact.\"\n\nThe planning committee also agreed to extend planning permission for the Drum\nand Monkey site to continue as a temporary car park until June 2022.\n\nThe land with the garages will be able to accommodate up to 90 cars, according\nto the council.\n\nHowever, fears were raised that the temporary car park use would not promote\nmore sustainable forms of transport such as cycling.\n\nCouncillor Oliver Holmes, who voted against the proposal, said it was a \"major\ndeparture\" from the council's own local plan which said that temporary car\nparks were not permitted.\n\nHe said: \"In approving this application for an Ipswich Borough site, we have\neffectively lost control of temporary uses on any future site in the town\ncentre.\n\n\"Any applicant will say 'you gave yourselves planning permission against\npolicy so why cannot I have it?'\"\n\nIt is not yet clear if the Covid-19 crisis will impact on future development\nof those sites, with offices and hotels among those hit by the pandemic.\n\nHowever, the council has continued to pursue plans to build a multi-storey car\npark directly behind on its large Portman Road car park, the designs of which\nwere first unveiled last month.",

    "html": "<p>Plans for the demolition of garages in a key business district of Ipswich have been given the go-ahead, paving the way for a future &#163;7million transformation of the area.</p>\n<p>Ipswich Borough Council&#8217;s planning committee gave the green light for the authority to knock down the old Aspire Cars and Avanti Autos garages in <location>Princes Street</location> at its virtual planning meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>In the short term, those sites will be used as temporary car parks along with the old Drum and Monkey site but have been earmarked for a major &#163;7m transformation in the <location>Princes Street</location> business corridor.</p>\n<p>It emerged last year that a hotel chain were interested in the Drum and Monkey site, while an office block is expected on the garages site. </p>\n<p>In its application the council said: &#8220;The building is in a poor state of repair and currently has a negative impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Its demolition in advance of the construction of replacement buildings is seen as a positive impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The planning committee also agreed to extend planning permission for the Drum and Monkey site to continue as a temporary car park until <chron>June 2022</chron>.</p>\n<p>The land with the garages will be able to accommodate up to 90 cars, according to the council.</p>\n<p>However, fears were raised that the temporary car park use would not promote more sustainable forms of transport such as cycling.</p>\n<p>Councillor <person>Oliver Holmes</person>, who voted against the proposal, said it was a &#8220;major departure&#8221; from the council&#8217;s own local plan which said that temporary car parks were not permitted.</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;In approving this application for an Ipswich Borough site, we have effectively lost control of temporary uses on any future site in the town centre. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Any applicant will say &#8216;you gave yourselves planning permission against policy so why cannot I have it?&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not yet clear if the Covid-19 crisis will impact on future development of those sites, with offices and hotels among those hit by the pandemic.</p>\n<p>However, the council has continued to pursue plans to build a multi-storey car park directly behind on its large <location>Portman Road</location> car park, the designs of which were first unveiled last month.</p>",
