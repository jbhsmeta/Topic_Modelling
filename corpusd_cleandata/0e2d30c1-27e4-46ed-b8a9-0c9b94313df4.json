    "text": "Though Gov. John Bel Edwards will allow bars around the state to reopen at\nreduced capacity on Friday, watering holes in New Orleans will remain\nshuttered as officials keep current coronavirus restrictions in place for a\nlittle while longer.\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell reiterated on Monday that the city will be hanging back\nand leaving the current restrictions in place, at least until the effects of\nthe first phase of the reopening plan and the Memorial Day weekend are more\napparent. However, she said some of the current rules \u0096 which are stricter\nthan those in place in the rest of the state \u0096 could be tweaked in the coming\ndays.\n\n\"Right now, absolutely, we are not moving into Phase 2,\" Cantrell said at a\npress conference. \"But we are revisiting to see, still within Phase 1, where\nwe can loosen restrictions.\"\n\nThe announcement was met with mixed reactions from bar owners in New Orleans,\nwith some expressing frustration over the lack of a clear timeline for when\nthey might be able to open their doors.\n\n\"I think that we in this city have done a great job of flattening the curve\nand being a leader nationwide in getting things under control,\" said Trey\nMonaghan, whose family owns three bars across the city. \"But I think it's\nbordering on getting very dangerous for the hospitality industry to be able to\nbounce back.\"\n\nEdwards announced that he would be moving the state into Phase 2, which will\nallow bars that don't serve food to reopen at 25% of their capacity.\nRestaurants, salons and retailers, which have already been allowed to operate\nat that level, will be allowed to serve twice as many people at a time.\n\nStatewide, spas, tattoo parlors and massage parlors will also be allowed to\nreopen. It's not clear if those businesses will be allowed to operate in New\nOrleans.\n\nCasinos will also be allowed to expand their capacity elsewhere in the state,\nthough Harrah's Casino in New Orleans remains shuttered. Cantrell has said she\nhas been having conversations with Harrah's about the reopening plans.\n\nBars have been a particular focus of coronavirus regulations across the\ncountry, because an atmosphere of mingling and close contact can allow the\nvirus to spread. In an effort to mitigate that, the bars that open will be\nrequired to seat patrons at tables that are spaced out to prevent close\ncontact.\n\nThe state rules serve as a baseline and local governments are allowed to set\ntheir own, more restrictive regulations to fight the spread of the\ncoronavirus. New Orleans, which was at the center of the initial outbreak, has\nbeen alone in taking that path for much of the pandemic.\n\nIt's not clear whether other cities will also choose to keep more restrictive\nrules in place but both Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes will be moving into\nPhase 2 along with the rest of the state, officials said on Monday.\n\nThe effect of those differing rules could, of course, also impact New Orleans,\nsince residents can easily drive to suburban parishes.\n\nMonaghan, whose family owns Molly's at the Market, 13 Monaghan and Junction,\nrepeatedly praised Cantrell's overall handling of the pandemic, but said it\nwas frustrating watching the reopening timeline lengthen without a clear sign\nof what level of progress would be enough for the city. New Orleans had seen\nthe highest numbers of cases in the state, and among the highest rates in the\ncountry at some points in April, but has since suppressed the virus. The city\nis now reporting a relatively low and stable number of cases.\n\nAnd the long shutdown has come as the bars have seen their peak tourist season\ncome and go.\n\n\"I've had very strong criticisms of this mayor in the past but I absolutely\ncommend her on the strong effort to save lives in this city. When this is over\nshe's welcome to come and guest bartend with me at Molly's,\" Monaghan said.\n\"But let's get some clear direction on this thing and make it happen. When we\nstarted this thing it was going to be a couple weeks. It's now two months, two\nand a half months later.\"\n\nAlex Fein with the French Quarter Business League, which represents bars on\nBourbon Street, said his group is waiting to hear more about exactly what\nchanges Cantrell would propose.\n\n\"Obviously we'd be happier being more open after this than not, but we'll wait\nto hear what the new guidelines are,\" Fein said.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum David Clements, who owns Snake and Jakes and\nCircle Bar, said he wasn't in a rush to reopen.\n\n\"I've been telling everyone this since day one: I'd rather stay closed a month\ntoo long unnecessarily than open a day too early,\" Clements said. \"We've been\nthrough all this and of course I want to reopen, but trying to reopen even at\n50%, I have no idea how we would do that.\"\n\nClements, who was adding space to the Snakes and Jakes backyard on Monday to\nprepare for a time when he could reopen, said policing his clientele to abide\nby the governor's restrictions might be too difficult, even if he could\nreopen.\n\n\"We're not really known for our responsible behavior here, so I don't know how\nmuch people who are drinking heavily are going to listen,\" Clements said.",

    "title": "With Phase 2 in New Orleans postponed, how long until its bars reopen?",
    "html": "<p>Though Gov. <person>John Bel Edwards</person> will allow bars around the state to reopen at reduced capacity on Friday, watering holes in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> will remain shuttered as officials keep current coronavirus restrictions in place for a little while longer.</p>\n<p>Mayor <person>LaToya Cantrell</person> reiterated on Monday that the city will be hanging back and leaving the current restrictions in place, at least until the effects of the first phase of the reopening plan and the <chron>Memorial Day</chron> weekend are more apparent. However, she said some of the current rules &#150; which are stricter than those in place in the rest of the state &#150; could be tweaked in the coming days.</p>\n\n<p>\"Right now, absolutely, we are not moving into Phase 2,\" Cantrell said at a press conference. \"But we are revisiting to see, still within Phase 1, where we can loosen restrictions.\"</p>\n\n<p>The announcement was met with mixed reactions from bar owners in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location>, with some expressing frustration over the lack of a clear timeline for when they might be able to open their doors.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think that we in this city have done a great job of flattening the curve and being a leader nationwide in getting things under control,\" said <person>Trey Monaghan</person>, whose family owns three bars across the city. \"But I think it's bordering on getting very dangerous for the hospitality industry to be able to bounce back.\"</p>\n\n<p>Edwards announced that he would be moving the state into Phase 2, which will allow bars that don't serve food to reopen at 25% of their capacity. Restaurants, salons and retailers, which have already been allowed to operate at that level, will be allowed to serve twice as many people at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Statewide, spas, tattoo parlors and massage parlors will also be allowed to reopen. It's not clear if those businesses will be allowed to operate in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Casinos will also be allowed to expand their capacity elsewhere in the state, though Harrah's Casino in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> remains shuttered. Cantrell has said she has been having conversations with Harrah's about the reopening plans.</p>\n\n<p>Bars have been a particular focus of coronavirus regulations across the country, because an atmosphere of mingling and close contact can allow the virus to spread. In an effort to mitigate that, the bars that open will be required to seat patrons at tables that are spaced out to prevent close contact.</p>\n\n<p>The state rules serve as a baseline and local governments are allowed to set their own, more restrictive regulations to fight the spread of the coronavirus. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location>, which was at the center of the initial outbreak, has been alone in taking that path for much of the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>It's not clear whether other cities will also choose to keep more restrictive rules in place but both <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.jefson\">Jefferson</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.sttany\">St. Tammany</location> parishes will be moving into Phase 2 along with the rest of the state, officials said on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>The effect of those differing rules could, of course, also impact <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location>, since residents can easily drive to suburban parishes.</p>\n\n<p>Monaghan, whose family owns Molly's at the Market, 13 Monaghan and Junction, repeatedly praised Cantrell's overall handling of the pandemic, but said it was frustrating watching the reopening timeline lengthen without a clear sign of what level of progress would be enough for the city. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> had seen the highest numbers of cases in the state, and among the highest rates in the country at some points in April, but has since suppressed the virus. The city is now reporting a relatively low and stable number of cases.</p>\n\n<p>And the long shutdown has come as the bars have seen their peak tourist season come and go.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've had very strong criticisms of this mayor in the past but I absolutely commend her on the strong effort to save lives in this city. When this is over she's welcome to come and guest bartend with me at Molly's,\" Monaghan said. \"But let's get some clear direction on this thing and make it happen. When we started this thing it was going to be a couple weeks. It's now two months, two and a half months later.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Alex Fein</person> with the <org>French Quarter Business League</org>, which represents bars on <location>Bourbon Street</location>, said his group is waiting to hear more about exactly what changes Cantrell would propose.</p>\n\n<p>\"Obviously we'd be happier being more open after this than not, but we'll wait to hear what the new guidelines are,\" Fein said.</p>\n\n<p>On the other side of the spectrum <person>David Clements</person>, who owns Snake and Jakes and Circle Bar, said he wasn't in a rush to reopen.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've been telling everyone this since day one: I'd rather stay closed a month too long unnecessarily than open a day too early,\" Clements said. \"We've been through all this and of course I want to reopen, but trying to reopen even at 50%, I have no idea how we would do that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Clements, who was adding space to the Snakes and Jakes backyard on Monday to prepare for a time when he could reopen, said policing his clientele to abide by the governor's restrictions might be too difficult, even if he could reopen.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're not really known for our responsible behavior here, so I don't know how much people who are drinking heavily are going to listen,\" Clements said.</p>",
