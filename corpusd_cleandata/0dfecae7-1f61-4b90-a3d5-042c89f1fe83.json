    "text": "The University of Houston-Victoria recently honored three faculty members for\ntheir outstanding contributions to the university, its students and the\ncommunity through teaching, research and service.\n\nThe faculty members are selected by their colleagues and students each spring\nfor the prestigious awards. This year's winners are:\n\nTeaching Excellence Award \u0096 Chien-Ping Chen, professor of economics in the\nSchool of Business AdministrationResearch and Scholarly Activity Excellence\nAward \u0096 Massomeh Hajilee, associate professor of economics and international\nbusiness in the School of Business AdministrationDistinguished Faculty Service\nAward \u0096 Jeffrey Blodgett, professor of marketing in the School of Business\nAdministration\n\nEach winner will receive a plaque and a monetary award. They also will be\nhonored during UHV's spring graduation ceremonies once it is safe to hold the\nevent.\n\n\"UHV faculty members are essential to the success of our students and our\nuniversity, and these awards acknowledge those who have made an exceptional\nimpact in three key areas,\" said Chance Glenn, UHV provost and vice president\nfor academic affairs. \"I applaud each of them for their hard work and efforts\nto continue UHV's tradition of excellence.\"\n\nThe Teaching Excellence Award was established in 1993. UHV students nominate\nprofessors who exemplify innovative, high-quality instruction relevant to\ntheir lives and careers.\n\nFor Chen, receiving the teaching award is a confirmation that his enthusiasm\nin teaching is appreciated by his students. Chen also received the teaching\naward in 2005.\n\n\"This is a great honor for me, especially the nominations from students during\nthe current challenging times,\" he said. \"I didn't really expect it. Part of\nmy success in teaching comes from the fact that I love economics. When I teach\nmy students, I share that love with them and try to help them see its\nimportance.\"\n\nChen encourages his students to participate in classes, he said. Although the\nuniversity moved all of its classes online during the spring semester because\nof the COVID-19 pandemic and a fire in UHV University West, Chen has\nexperience teaching online and knows the importance of reaching out to\nstudents to make sure they stay involved and connected.\n\n\"Some people see online teaching and classes as easy, but to truly be an\nexcellent teacher, you have to put in extra effort when your students are\nonline instead of in the classroom,\" he said. \"You have to earn and keep their\nattention so they know that you know them and see their hard work.\"\n\nThe Research and Scholarly Activity Excellence Award recognizes professors who\nhave made outstanding research contributions to their scholarly communities.\nHajilee's research focuses on elements of international economics, especially\nin emerging economies. Her recent research focuses on topics that include\nfinancial inclusion, shadow economies and financial market development,\nincluding banking sector and stock market developments.\n\n\"Receiving this honor means a lot, because it shows that the university knows\nthe value of research, hard work and dedication,\" she said. \"I believe that\nresearch is the foundation on which universities are built. Research improves\nfaculty's teaching. For us to continue to add value to students' educational\nexperiences, we must actively remain engaged in the field \u0096 both in terms of\nresearch and best practice.\"\n\nHajilee's research has been published in highly respected journals. In\naddition, she has served as a reviewer of more than 50 journals, reviewed more\nthan 100 articles, served as an article editor, been on a journal's editorial\nboard, and participated in economic professional presentations and served as\nthe chair of discussion sessions.\n\nUHV faculty members also annually recognize a peer with the Distinguished\nFaculty Service Award to someone who serves both the university and community.\n\nFor Blodgett, service is an essential part of being a good leader, especially\nwhen it comes to paving the way for those in the next generation. It is his\nbelief that faculty members should be involved in a wide range of\nopportunities at the university, especially in terms of shared governance.\n\n\"As the university makes important decisions, it is essential that\nadministration consult with the faculty through the Faculty Senate to get\nfeedback,\" he said. \"Ever since President Bob Glenn took office, and now with\nProvost Glenn, there have been lots of good discussion on various topics, and\nthe best and well-reasoned solutions tend to rise to the top. We recognize\nthat shared governance does not mean that the university is bound to always\nfollow our recommendations, and are appreciative of the opportunity to provide\nmeaningful input, and the fact that the administration takes our thoughts into\nconsideration.\"\n\nDuring the past year, he has served as the UHV School of Business\nAdministration member on the university Faculty Senate's executive team. He\nalso is the chair of the Faculty Salary Committee and chair of the marketing\ncommittee that is part of the UHV Academic Strategic Planning Committee.\n\n\"It's important to me to try to do whatever I can to make the university a\nbetter place for younger faculty,\" Blodgett said. \"UHV has a lot of great,\nyoung faculty members. It's important for the senior faculty to advocate for\nthem so they can continue UHV's tradition of offering an excellent higher\neducation to our students.\"\n\nAs another example of giving back, Blodgett has donated the honorarium that\ncomes with this award to the UHV Student Emergency Fund.\n\nOutside of UHV, Blodgett has served as the American Association of University\nProfessors regional vice president for Texas. In July, he will become the\nassociation's president for a three-year term.",

    "html": "<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432474675\">The University of Houston-Victoria</org> recently honored three faculty members for their outstanding contributions to the university, its students and the community through teaching, research and service.</p>\n<p>The faculty members are selected by their colleagues and students each spring for the prestigious awards. This year's winners are:</p>\n\n<p>Teaching Excellence Award &#150; Chien-Ping Chen, professor of economics in the <org>School of Business AdministrationResearch and Scholarly Activity Excellence Award</org> &#150; Massomeh Hajilee, associate professor of economics and international business in the <org>School of Business AdministrationDistinguished Faculty Service Award</org> &#150; <person>Jeffrey Blodgett</person>, professor of marketing in the <org>School of Business Administration</org></p>\n\n<p>Each winner will receive a plaque and a monetary award. They also will be honored during UHV's spring graduation ceremonies once it is safe to hold the event.</p>\n\n<p>\"UHV faculty members are essential to the success of our students and our university, and these awards acknowledge those who have made an exceptional impact in three key areas,\" said <person>Chance Glenn</person>, UHV provost and vice president for academic affairs. \"I applaud each of them for their hard work and efforts to continue UHV's tradition of excellence.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Teaching Excellence Award was established in 1993. UHV students nominate professors who exemplify innovative, high-quality instruction relevant to their lives and careers.</p>\n\n<p>For Chen, receiving the teaching award is a confirmation that his enthusiasm in teaching is appreciated by his students. Chen also received the teaching award in 2005.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is a great honor for me, especially the nominations from students during the current challenging times,\" he said. \"I didn't really expect it. Part of my success in teaching comes from the fact that I love economics. When I teach my students, I share that love with them and try to help them see its importance.\"</p>\n\n<p>Chen encourages his students to participate in classes, he said. Although the university moved all of its classes online during the spring semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a fire in UHV University West, Chen has experience teaching online and knows the importance of reaching out to students to make sure they stay involved and connected.</p>\n\n<p>\"Some people see online teaching and classes as easy, but to truly be an excellent teacher, you have to put in extra effort when your students are online instead of in the classroom,\" he said. \"You have to earn and keep their attention so they know that you know them and see their hard work.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Research and Scholarly Activity Excellence Award recognizes professors who have made outstanding research contributions to their scholarly communities. Hajilee's research focuses on elements of international economics, especially in emerging economies. Her recent research focuses on topics that include financial inclusion, shadow economies and financial market development, including banking sector and stock market developments.</p>\n\n<p>\"Receiving this honor means a lot, because it shows that the university knows the value of research, hard work and dedication,\" she said. \"I believe that research is the foundation on which universities are built. Research improves faculty's teaching. For us to continue to add value to students' educational experiences, we must actively remain engaged in the field &#150; both in terms of research and best practice.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hajilee's research has been published in highly respected journals. In addition, she has served as a reviewer of more than 50 journals, reviewed more than 100 articles, served as an article editor, been on a journal's editorial board, and participated in economic professional presentations and served as the chair of discussion sessions.</p>\n\n<p>UHV faculty members also annually recognize a peer with the Distinguished Faculty Service Award to someone who serves both the university and community.</p>\n\n<p>For Blodgett, service is an essential part of being a good leader, especially when it comes to paving the way for those in the next generation. It is his belief that faculty members should be involved in a wide range of opportunities at the university, especially in terms of shared governance.</p>\n\n<p>\"As the university makes important decisions, it is essential that administration consult with the faculty through the <org>Faculty Senate</org> to get feedback,\" he said. \"Ever since President <person>Bob Glenn</person> took office, and now with <person>Provost Glenn</person>, there have been lots of good discussion on various topics, and the best and well-reasoned solutions tend to rise to the top. We recognize that shared governance does not mean that the university is bound to always follow our recommendations, and are appreciative of the opportunity to provide meaningful input, and the fact that the administration takes our thoughts into consideration.\"</p>\n\n<p>During the past year, he has served as the <org>UHV School of Business Administration</org> member on the university <org>Faculty Senate's</org> executive team. He also is the chair of the Faculty Salary Committee and chair of the marketing committee that is part of the UHV Academic Strategic Planning Committee.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's important to me to try to do whatever I can to make the university a better place for younger faculty,\" Blodgett said. \"UHV has a lot of great, young faculty members. It's important for the senior faculty to advocate for them so they can continue UHV's tradition of offering an excellent higher education to our students.\"</p>\n\n<p>As another example of giving back, Blodgett has donated the honorarium that comes with this award to the <org>UHV Student Emergency Fund</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of UHV, Blodgett has served as the <org>American Association of University Professors</org> regional vice president for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>. In July, he will become the association's president for a three-year term.</p>",
