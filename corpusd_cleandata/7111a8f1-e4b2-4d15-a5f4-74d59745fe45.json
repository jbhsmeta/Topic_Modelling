    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Medical\nDevices Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from Washington,\nD.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors WANG,\nBenjamin R. (San Jose, CA); HANLON, Brenton (Palo Alto, CA), filed on November\n15, 2019, was made available online on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent application is Nevap Inc. (San Jose, California,\nUnited States).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Tracheal tubes with inflatable balloons with\nsuction means are broadly known in the prior art. However, the suctioning\nmeans of such prior arts are inefficient with suctioning secretions above and\naround the balloon, therefore allowing secretions and/or pathogens to travel\nthrough the balloon and tracheal walls and into the airflow of the tracheal\ntube. In certain situations, the secretions/pathogens get aerosolized by the\nhigh velocity of the ventilated air traveling through the tracheal tube and\ninto the patient's lungs. Aerosolized pathogens traveling at high velocity may\nsend the pathogens deep into the lungs, which may cause ventilator associated\npneumonia (VAP) as well as other diseases.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this\npatent application: \"Systems and devices for preventing occlusion of a suction\nline resident in a medical device are herein disclosed. One embodiment of the\npresent invention utilizes a tube system that may include a tube that is\nflexible and hollow with a first open end and a second open end, a suction\nline configured to be coupled to a suction device that applies negative\npressure to the suction line, a suction line port, and a spacer that extends\nfrom an exterior surface of the tube and is positioned proximate to the\nsuction line port. The first open end of the tube may be configured to be\ncoupled to an artificial ventilation device. The negative pressure created by\nthe suction device may suck fluid from the trachea through the suction line\nport when the tube system is placed in a patient's trachea and the suction\ndevice is active.\n\n\"The tube may further include an inflatable balloon affixed to, and\ncircumferentially surrounding an exterior portion of the tube. The inflatable\nballoon may be positioned between the first open end and the second open end\nof the tube and may be inflated via an inflation line lumen coupled to an air\nsupply.\n\n\"The spacer may be configured and/or positioned to prevent occlusion of the\nsuction line port and may be affixed to the tube via a bond, a sleeve, a clip,\na strap, and/or a clamp. In some instances, the spacer may be flexible or\notherwise deformable so as to, for example, adapt to a patient's anatomy\nand/or ease insertion of the tube system into a patient's trachea.\n\n\"In some embodiments, the tube system may include a plurality of spacers\npositioned proximate to the suction line port. Additionally, or alternatively,\nthe spacer(s) may extend longitudinally along a portion of a length of the\ntube. Additionally, or alternatively, the spacer(s) may extend\ncircumferentially around a portion of a circumference of the tube.\n\n\"In some embodiments, the spacer, or a portion thereof, may not touch the\nexterior surface of the tube and may, instead, extend above the exterior\nsurface of the tube. For example, the portion of the spacer that does not\ntouch the exterior surface of the tube may be flexible and may be configured\nto compress toward the exterior surface of the tube when a force is exerted\nthereon during, for example, insertion of the tube system into the trachea of\na patient and/or when resident within the patient's trachea. Additionally, or\nalternatively, the spacer(s) may be coupled to the tube via an extension that\nextends between the spacer and the exterior surface of the tube. For example,\nthe spacer may include a ring that extends circumferentially around a\ncircumference of the tube and a plurality of extensions that extend between\nthe ring and the exterior surface of the tube. Additionally, or alternatively,\nthe tube system may include a first ring that extends circumferentially around\na circumference of the tube that is positioned between the balloon and the\nsuction line port and coupled to the tube via a first plurality of extensions\nthat extend between the first ring and the exterior surface of the tube. In\nsome cases, the tube system may further include a second ring that extends\ncircumferentially around a circumference of the tube that is positioned\nbetween the suction line port and the second end of the tube and may be\ncoupled to the tube via a second plurality of extensions that extend between\nthe second ring and the exterior surface of the tube. An inner circumference\nof the first and/or second rings may be between 100% and 150% of an outer\ncircumference of the tube. An outer circumference of the first and/or second\nrings may be between 100.1% and 200% of an outer circumference of the tube.\n\n\"In some embodiments, the tube may further include an volume replacement\nchannel that may be configured to introduce ambient air (or another substance\nflowing through volume replacement channel) into the patient's trachea such\nthat, for example, a distance between the first and second ports of the volume\nreplacement channel allows for ambient air (or another fluid) to flow into the\nfirst port and exit the second port. This may aid in the suction of air and\nfluid from the patient's trachea. In some instances, the volume replacement\nchannel may include a first port positioned proximate to the inflatable\nballoon and a second port positioned near the second open end of the tube.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\. A tube system comprising: a tube that is flexible and hollow and having a\nfirst open end and a second open end, the tube comprising: a suction line\nconfigured to be coupled to a suction device that applies negative pressure to\nthe suction line; a suction line port; and a spacer that extends from an\nexterior surface of the tube and is positioned proximate to the suction line\nport, the spacer being configured to prevent occlusion of the suction line\nport; and an inflatable balloon affixed to, and circumferentially surrounding\nan exterior portion of the tube, the inflatable balloon being positioned\nbetween the first open end and the second open end of the tube.\n\n\"2\\.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>NewsRx Medical Devices Daily</org> -- According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, D.C.</location>, by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors WANG, Benjamin R. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanjse\">San Jose, CA</location>); HANLON, Brenton (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.paloal\">Palo Alto, CA</location>), filed on <chron>November 15, 2019</chron>, was made available online on <chron>May 21, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The assignee for this patent application is <org>Nevap Inc.</org> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanjse\">San Jose, California</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>).</p>\n<p>Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;Tracheal tubes with inflatable balloons with suction means are broadly known in the prior art. However, the suctioning means of such prior arts are inefficient with suctioning secretions above and around the balloon, therefore allowing secretions and/or pathogens to travel through the balloon and tracheal walls and into the airflow of the tracheal tube. In certain situations, the secretions/pathogens get aerosolized by the high velocity of the ventilated air traveling through the tracheal tube and into the patient&#8217;s lungs. Aerosolized pathogens traveling at high velocity may send the pathogens deep into the lungs, which may cause ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) as well as other diseases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;Systems and devices for preventing occlusion of a suction line resident in a medical device are herein disclosed. One embodiment of the present invention utilizes a tube system that may include a tube that is flexible and hollow with a first open end and a second open end, a suction line configured to be coupled to a suction device that applies negative pressure to the suction line, a suction line port, and a spacer that extends from an exterior surface of the tube and is positioned proximate to the suction line port. The first open end of the tube may be configured to be coupled to an artificial ventilation device. The negative pressure created by the suction device may suck fluid from the trachea through the suction line port when the tube system is placed in a patient&#8217;s trachea and the suction device is active.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The tube may further include an inflatable balloon affixed to, and circumferentially surrounding an exterior portion of the tube. The inflatable balloon may be positioned between the first open end and the second open end of the tube and may be inflated via an inflation line lumen coupled to an air supply.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The spacer may be configured and/or positioned to prevent occlusion of the suction line port and may be affixed to the tube via a bond, a sleeve, a clip, a strap, and/or a clamp. In some instances, the spacer may be flexible or otherwise deformable so as to, for example, adapt to a patient&#8217;s anatomy and/or ease insertion of the tube system into a patient&#8217;s trachea.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some embodiments, the tube system may include a plurality of spacers positioned proximate to the suction line port. Additionally, or alternatively, the spacer(s) may extend longitudinally along a portion of a length of the tube. Additionally, or alternatively, the spacer(s) may extend circumferentially around a portion of a circumference of the tube.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some embodiments, the spacer, or a portion thereof, may not touch the exterior surface of the tube and may, instead, extend above the exterior surface of the tube. For example, the portion of the spacer that does not touch the exterior surface of the tube may be flexible and may be configured to compress toward the exterior surface of the tube when a force is exerted thereon during, for example, insertion of the tube system into the trachea of a patient and/or when resident within the patient&#8217;s trachea. Additionally, or alternatively, the spacer(s) may be coupled to the tube via an extension that extends between the spacer and the exterior surface of the tube. For example, the spacer may include a ring that extends circumferentially around a circumference of the tube and a plurality of extensions that extend between the ring and the exterior surface of the tube. Additionally, or alternatively, the tube system may include a first ring that extends circumferentially around a circumference of the tube that is positioned between the balloon and the suction line port and coupled to the tube via a first plurality of extensions that extend between the first ring and the exterior surface of the tube. In some cases, the tube system may further include a second ring that extends circumferentially around a circumference of the tube that is positioned between the suction line port and the second end of the tube and may be coupled to the tube via a second plurality of extensions that extend between the second ring and the exterior surface of the tube. An inner circumference of the first and/or second rings may be between 100% and 150% of an outer circumference of the tube. An outer circumference of the first and/or second rings may be between 100.1% and 200% of an outer circumference of the tube.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some embodiments, the tube may further include an volume replacement channel that may be configured to introduce ambient air (or another substance flowing through volume replacement channel) into the patient&#8217;s trachea such that, for example, a distance between the first and second ports of the volume replacement channel allows for ambient air (or another fluid) to flow into the first port and exit the second port. This may aid in the suction of air and fluid from the patient&#8217;s trachea. In some instances, the volume replacement channel may include a first port positioned proximate to the inflatable balloon and a second port positioned near the second open end of the tube.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
