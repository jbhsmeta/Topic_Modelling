    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information\nTechnology Business Daily \\-- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists\nreport that a patent by the inventors Hong, Do-Sun (Icheon-si, South Korea);\nKwon, Jung Hyun (Seoul, South Korea); Shin, Won Gyu (Icheon-si, South Korea);\nJeong, Seung Gyu (Icheon-si, South Korea), filed on December 28, 2018, was\npublished online on June 8, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee for patent number 10,665,297 is SK Hynix Inc. (Icheon-\nsi, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Various embodiments of the present disclosure\ngenerally relate to memory systems and, more particularly, to memory systems\nand methods of operating the memory systems.\n\n\"Logic levels of data stored in phase change memory (PCM) devices may be\ndetermined according to a phase state of a phase changeable material (e.g., a\nchalcogenide compound material such as a germanium-stibium-tellurium (GST)\nmaterial) included in each of memory cells of the PCM devices. For example, a\ncertain memory cell may be regarded as a memory cell having a logic 'high(1)'\nlevel if a phase changeable material included in the certain memory cell has a\ncrystalline state, and the certain memory cell may be regarded as a memory\ncell having a logic 'low(0)' level if the phase changeable material included\nin the certain memory cell has an amorphous state. The PCM devices exhibit a\nrelatively high operation speed with a high integration density. Thus, the PCM\ndevices may be attractive as a candidate for replacing dynamic random access\nmemory (DRAM) devices in computers or other digital systems. The PCM devices\nmay have a limited lifetime and a limited durability like other nonvolatile\nmemory devices. In particular, the number of write cycles of the PCM devices\nmay be restricted due to a characteristic of the phase changeable material and\nlimitation of design, and the probability of error occurrence may increase as\nthe number of write cycles of the PCM devices increases. Accordingly, it may\nbe important to detect and verify errors that occur during a write operation\nand a read operation of the PCM devices.\n\n\"An error correction code (ECC) mechanism is widely used to detect and verify\nthe errors that occur while the PCM devices operate. While the write operation\nis performed in the PCM devices, write data may be changed into a codeword\nincluding parity data by an ECC encoding operation and the codeword may be\nstored into the memory cells. The codeword stored in the memory cells may be\nrestored into a shape of the original data by an ECC decoding operation while\nthe read operation is performed, During the ECC decoding operation, erroneous\ndata may be detected using the parity data included in the codeword and the\nerroneous data may be corrected in some cases.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx\ncorrespondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this\npatent: \"According to an embodiment, there is provided a memory system.

For example, a certain memory cell may be regarded as a memory cell having a logic &#8216;high(1)&#8217; level if a phase changeable material included in the certain memory cell has a crystalline state, and the certain memory cell may be regarded as a memory cell having a logic &#8216;low(0)&#8217; level if the phase changeable material included in the certain memory cell has an amorphous state. The PCM devices exhibit a relatively high operation speed with a high integration density. Thus, the PCM devices may be attractive as a candidate for replacing dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices in computers or other digital systems. The PCM devices may have a limited lifetime and a limited durability like other nonvolatile memory devices. In particular, the number of write cycles of the PCM devices may be restricted due to a characteristic of the phase changeable material and limitation of design, and the probability of error occurrence may increase as the number of write cycles of the PCM devices increases. Accordingly, it may be important to detect and verify errors that occur during a write operation and a read operation of the PCM devices.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An error correction code (ECC) mechanism is widely used to detect and verify the errors that occur while the PCM devices operate. While the write operation is performed in the PCM devices, write data may be changed into a codeword including parity data by an ECC encoding operation and the codeword may be stored into the memory cells. The codeword stored in the memory cells may be restored into a shape of the original data by an ECC decoding operation while the read operation is performed, During the ECC decoding operation, erroneous data may be detected using the parity data included in the codeword and the erroneous data may be corrected in some cases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;According to an embodiment, there is provided a memory system. The memory system includes a memory device and a memory controller. The memory device has a plurality of memory regions. The memory controller is configured to generate a read command for a first memory region corresponding to one of the plurality of memory regions when the number of write commands successively generated for the first memory region reaches a reference value.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to an embodiment, there is provided a memory system. The memory system includes a memory device and a memory controller. The memory device has a plurality of memory regions. The memory controller is configured to generate a read command for data stored in a first memory region corresponding to one of the plurality of memory regions whenever a write command for the first memory region is generated from a point of time that the number of the write command repeatedly generated for the first memory region is equal to or greater than a reference value.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to an embodiment, there is provided a method of operating a memory system including a memory device having a plurality of memory regions. The method includes counting a current write counting value for a first memory region corresponding to one of the plurality of memory regions to change the current write counting value into an updated write counting value when a write command for the first memory region is generated. The updated write counting value is compared with a reference value, and a read command for the first memory region is generated when the updated write counting value reaches a reference value.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to an embodiment, there is provided a method of operating a memory system including a memory device having a plurality of memory regions.
