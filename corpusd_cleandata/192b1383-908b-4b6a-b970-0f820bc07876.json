The search is being done around <location>E.

These include burglary of habitation and unlawful possession of a firearm, according to court records.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:jose.gonzalez@chron.com\">jose.gonzalez@chron.com</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/jrgzztx\">twitter.com/jrgzztx</a></p>",
