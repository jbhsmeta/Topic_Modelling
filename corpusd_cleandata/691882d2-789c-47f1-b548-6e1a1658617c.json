    "text": "It is common knowledge in the construction industry that there is a growing\nshortage of skilled labor in the workforce, with senior workers retiring\nfaster than they can be replaced. Now, with the rise of COVID-19, the absence\nof skilled labor is even more likely in the immediate future. With this in\nmind, it s no wonder that modular construction is becoming one of the most\npopular trends to discuss when planning a new project.\n\nTo break it down, modular construction involves creating buildings from a\nseries of modules that are crafted in a factory setting. Similar to cruise\nships or submarines, the individual modules are transported to construction\nsites for assembly. Because most of the building is not being constructed on\nlocation, the assembly process for a modular-designed building moves quicker\nand with less skilled labor than a typical construction project.\n\nTo serve as an example, Stephen B. Jacobs Group took advantage of modular\ndesign and construction for one of our more recent projects, the citizenM\nBowery hotel. Currently the world s tallest modular hotel, citizenM Bowery was\nlargely developed using factory built modules which simplified on-sight\nconstruction and expedited the overall process. The typical citizenM guest\nroom was conceived as a module and most of the brand s hotels around the world\nare build using modular construction.\n\nModular construction is especially well suited for short span spaces such as\nguest rooms, and less for long span spaces such as lobbies and lounges. For\nthat reason, the citizenM Bowery Hotel was designed using three different\nstructural systems. The lower floors, up to the fourth-floor slab, were built\nconventionally, using poured-in-place concrete. The 15 typical modular guest\nroom floors were then stacked on top of the 36-inch fourth floor concrete\nslab. And finally, above the modules, the rooftop bar, outdoor terrace, and\nadditional mechanical spaces were built using conventional steel construction.\n\nBuilding the world s tallest modular hotel within the dense urban fabric of\nNew York City s Lower East Side was not without logistical challenges. But we\novercame all these challenges and proved that building using modular\nconstruction make sense even on difficult sites.\n\nStephen B. Jacobs Group are currently working on several affordable housing\nprojects outside of New York City using wood modular construction. These\nprojects are two to three stories and are logistically much easier to build,\ngiven the open space. These projects are another example of types which make\ntotal sense to build using modular construction.\n\nHealthcare facilities are another project type that can benefit from modular\nconstruction. Especially now during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional\nfacilities could be quickly and efficiently built using factory build modular\nconstruction.\n\nModular construction will continue to grow as a construction type, especially\nin the hospitality, healthcare, and affordable housing markets. The scarcity\nof skilled labor and the efficiency of building in a factory-controlled\nenvironment make modular construction a no brainer. And the more modular\nprojects are designed and built, the more efficient the process will become.\n\nAbout Isaac-Daniel Astrachan, AIA, LEED AP: Principal Mr. Astrachan has been\nwith Stephen B. Jacobs Group since 1998 where he started as the project\nmanager for the Hotel Giraffe. Since then he has worked on the design of most\nof the firm s projects including the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking\nDistrict, 325 Fifth Avenue, The Ohm, the Copper Building, The Edge, Gansevoort\nPark Avenue Hotel, and ALTA LIC. He recently completed the citizenM Bowery\nHotel, the world s tallest modular hotel, and is currently working on a five-\nstar boutique hotel in Tribeca.\n\nPrior to joining the firm, Mr. Astrachan worked for Didier Repellin, Chief\nArchitect and Inspector-General of historic monuments in France.\n\nIsaac-Daniel Astrachan graduated from Columbia College in 1990 and received\nhis Master of Architecture degree from Harvard s Graduate School of Design in\n1995.

    "title": "Combating a Shortage of Skilled Labor with Modular Construction",
    "html": "<p>It is common knowledge in the construction industry that there is a growing shortage of skilled labor in the workforce, with senior workers retiring faster than they can be replaced. Now, with the rise of COVID-19, the absence of skilled labor is even more likely in the immediate future. With this in mind, it s no wonder that modular construction is becoming one of the most popular trends to discuss when planning a new project.</p>\n<p>To break it down, modular construction involves creating buildings from a series of modules that are crafted in a factory setting. Similar to cruise ships or submarines, the individual modules are transported to construction sites for assembly. Because most of the building is not being constructed on location, the assembly process for a modular-designed building moves quicker and with less skilled labor than a typical construction project.</p>\n<p>To serve as an example, <org>Stephen B. Jacobs Group</org> took advantage of modular design and construction for one of our more recent projects, the citizenM Bowery hotel. Currently the world s tallest modular hotel, citizenM Bowery was largely developed using factory built modules which simplified on-sight construction and expedited the overall process. The typical citizenM guest room was conceived as a module and most of the brand s hotels around the world are build using modular construction.</p>\n<p>Modular construction is especially well suited for short span spaces such as guest rooms, and less for long span spaces such as lobbies and lounges. For that reason, the citizenM <location>Bowery Hotel</location> was designed using three different structural systems. The lower floors, up to the fourth-floor slab, were built conventionally, using poured-in-place concrete. The 15 typical modular guest room floors were then stacked on top of the 36-inch fourth floor concrete slab. And finally, above the modules, the rooftop bar, outdoor terrace, and additional mechanical spaces were built using conventional steel construction.</p>\n<p>Building the world s tallest modular hotel within the dense urban fabric of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York City</location> s <person>Lower East Side</person> was not without logistical challenges. But we overcame all these challenges and proved that building using modular construction make sense even on difficult sites.</p>\n<p><org>Stephen B. Jacobs Group</org> are currently working on several affordable housing projects outside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York City</location> using wood modular construction. These projects are two to three stories and are logistically much easier to build, given the open space. These projects are another example of types which make total sense to build using modular construction.</p>\n<p>Healthcare facilities are another project type that can benefit from modular construction. Especially now during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional facilities could be quickly and efficiently built using factory build modular construction.</p>\n<p>Modular construction will continue to grow as a construction type, especially in the hospitality, healthcare, and affordable housing markets. The scarcity of skilled labor and the efficiency of building in a factory-controlled environment make modular construction a no brainer. And the more modular projects are designed and built, the more efficient the process will become.</p>\n<p>About <person>Isaac-Daniel Astrachan</person>, AIA, LEED AP: Principal <person>Mr. Astrachan</person> has been with <org>Stephen B.
