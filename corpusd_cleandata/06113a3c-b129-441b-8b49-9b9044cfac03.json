    "text": "WANTED: A 2012 graduate of Bertie High School who is missing their class ring.\n\nThis week, Sue Chadwick of Mt. Pleasant, SC reached out to the Roanoke-Chowan\nNews-Herald via email with an interesting story to share. Her brother, Jim\nSwetland \u0096 an avid beachcomber who uses a metal detector, has a Bertie High\nSchool class ring among his wide assortment of items discovered below the\nsand.\n\nChadwick said her brother found the ring Nov. 14, 2018 on the beach at\nSullivans Island, SC, located near Charleston, SC.\n\n\"I assist Jim in trying to locate the owners of jewelry items, at least those\nwith etched descriptions that are still visible,\" Chadwick said. \"I started\nwith 37 rings and I'm now down to only seven that I have not identified a\npossible owner.\n\n\"Google and Facebook Alumni sites are a help in my searches. So are some of\nthose people finder sites online, but they offer a limited amount of\ninformation unless you pay for more,\" she added.\n\nThe online search for the owner of the Bertie Class of 2012 ring turned up\nsome information.\n\n\"An internet search indicates there may be a person residing in Windsor, North\nCarolina that appears to be in that particular age range [a 2012 graduate],\nbut we have no other means to reach out to that person other than contacting\nyou at the local newspaper there for help,\" Chadwick stated.\n\nShe listed her contact information: 843-856-1961 or via email at\n[chadwick_sue@yahoo.com](mailto:chadwick_sue@yahoo.com).\n\n\"My brother would like to return this ring to its owner, so please contact\nme,\" Chadwick stressed.\n\nAs a personal note, Chadwick said she and her brother grew up along the shores\nof Lake Erie in New York. They moved south in the 1970's \u0096 Jim to North\nCharleston, SC and she just a few miles away in Mt. Pleasant.\n\n\"As a kid, Jim would beachcomb along Lake Erie looking for fishing lures way\nbefore he got into metal detecting,\" she shared. \"His only high tech\npossessions now were his metal detectors, that is until his flip phone broke a\ncouple weeks ago and he bought an Iphone.\n\n\"He doesn't use Facebook or email,\" she added. \"He would put ads in the paper\nyears ago when ads were published free for found items, but that was\ndiscontinued and now he just stores them along with all kinds of other things\nhe has found over the years.\"\n\nThose discoveries now include that Bertie High School ring he would love to\npart ways with by finding its rightful owner.\n\nAbout Cal Bryant\n\nCal Bryant, a 40-year veteran of the newspaper industry, serves as the Editor\nat Roanoke-Chowan Publications, publishers of the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald,\nGates County Index, and Front Porch Living magazine.\n\nMore by Cal",

Pleasant, SC</location> reached out to the <org>Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald</org> via email with an interesting story to share. Her brother, <person>Jim Swetland</person> &#150; an avid beachcomber who uses a metal detector, has a <org>Bertie High School</org> class ring among his wide assortment of items discovered below the sand.</p>\n\n<p>Chadwick said her brother found the ring <chron>Nov. 14, 2018</chron> on the beach at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.suland\">Sullivans Island, SC</location>, located near <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.chlstn\">Charleston, SC</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"I assist Jim in trying to locate the owners of jewelry items, at least those with etched descriptions that are still visible,\" Chadwick said. \"I started with 37 rings and I'm now down to only seven that I have not identified a possible owner.</p>\n\n<p>\"Google and Facebook Alumni sites are a help in my searches. So are some of those people finder sites online, but they offer a limited amount of information unless you pay for more,\" she added.</p>\n\n<p>The online search for the owner of the Bertie Class of 2012 ring turned up some information.</p>\n\n<p>\"An internet search indicates there may be a person residing in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.windso\">Windsor, North Carolina</location> that appears to be in that particular age range [a 2012 graduate], but we have no other means to reach out to that person other than contacting you at the local newspaper there for help,\" Chadwick stated.</p>\n\n<p>She listed her contact information: 843-856-1961 or via email at <a href=\"mailto:chadwick_sue@yahoo.com\">chadwick_sue@yahoo.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"My brother would like to return this ring to its owner, so please contact me,\" Chadwick stressed.</p>\n\n<p>As a personal note, Chadwick said she and her brother grew up along the shores of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>. They moved south in the 1970's &#150; Jim to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.norton\">North Charleston, SC</location> and she just a few miles away in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.mouant\">Mt. Pleasant</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"As a kid, Jim would beachcomb along <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> looking for fishing lures way before he got into metal detecting,\" she shared. \"His only high tech possessions now were his metal detectors, that is until his flip phone broke a couple weeks ago and he bought an Iphone.</p>\n\n<p>\"He doesn't use Facebook or email,\" she added. \"He would put ads in the paper years ago when ads were published free for found items, but that was discontinued and now he just stores them along with all kinds of other things he has found over the years.\"</p>\n\n<p>Those discoveries now include that <org>Bertie High School</org> ring he would love to part ways with by finding its rightful owner.</p>\n\n<p>About <person>Cal Bryant</person></p>\n\n<p><person>Cal Bryant</person>, a 40-year veteran of the newspaper industry, serves as the Editor at <org>Roanoke-Chowan Publications</org>, publishers of the <org>Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald</org>, Gates County Index, and <org>Front Porch Living magazine</org>.</p>\n\n<p>More by Cal</p>",
