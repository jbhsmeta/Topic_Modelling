    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Mining &\nMinerals Daily Daily \\-- Researchers detail new data in Metals Research \\-\nMetallurgy. According to news reporting from Warsaw, Poland, by NewsRx\njournalists, research stated, \"The present research is focused on the\ncharacterization of the composites from Al2O3-Cu-Ni system. Two methods of\nceramic-metal composite forming were applied: uniaxial powder pressing and\nPulse Plasma Sintering (PPS).\"\n\nFunders for this research include National Science Centre, Foundation for\nPolish Science (FNP) - START 2019 scholarship.\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Warsaw\nUniversity of Technology, \"To obtain the samples the powder mixtures\ncontaining 85 vol.% of Al(2)O(3 )and 15 vol.% of metal powders were used.\nInfluence of the sintering process on microstructure and mechanical properties\nof the two series of the composites was analyzed in detail. The selected\nphysical properties of samples were characterized by Archimedes immersion\nmethod. Vickers hardness and the fracture toughness of the composites was\ndetermined as well. The microstructure of the composites was characterized by\nXRD, SEM, EDX. Fracto-graphy investigation was carried out as well.\nIndependently on composite production method Al2O3, Cu, Ni, and CuNi phases\nwere revealed. Fractography investigation results revealed different character\nof fracture in dependence of fabrication method.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Pulse Plasma\nSintered samples were characterized by higher crack resistance and higher\nVickers hardness in comparison to the specimens manufactured by uniaxial\npressing.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Effect of the Powder Consolidation\nMethod Type On the Microstructure and Selected Properties of Al2o3-cu-ni\nComposites. _Archives of Metallurgy and Materials_ , 2020;65(2):967-974.\n_Archives of Metallurgy and Materials_ can be contacted at: Polska Akad Nauk,\nPolish Acad Sciences, Inst Metall & Mater Sci Pas, Pl, 00-901 Warszawa,\nPoland.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting J. Zygmuntowicz, Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of\nMaterials Science and Engineering, 141 Woloska Str, Pl-02507 Warsaw, Poland.\nAdditional authors for this research include P.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Mining &amp; Minerals Daily Daily</org> -- Researchers detail new data in <org>Metals Research</org> - Metallurgy. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/pl..warsaw\">Warsaw, Poland</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;The present research is focused on the characterization of the composites from Al2O3-Cu-Ni system. Two methods of ceramic-metal composite forming were applied: uniaxial powder pressing and Pulse Plasma Sintering (PPS).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Funders for this research include <org>National Science Centre</org>, <org>Foundation for Polish Science</org> (FNP) - START 2019 scholarship.</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the <org>Warsaw University</org> of Technology, &#8220;To obtain the samples the powder mixtures containing 85 vol.% of Al(2)O(3 )and 15 vol.% of metal powders were used. Influence of the sintering process on microstructure and mechanical properties of the two series of the composites was analyzed in detail. The selected physical properties of samples were characterized by Archimedes immersion method. Vickers hardness and the fracture toughness of the composites was determined as well. The microstructure of the composites was characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX. Fracto-graphy investigation was carried out as well. Independently on composite production method Al2O3, Cu, Ni, and CuNi phases were revealed. Fractography investigation results revealed different character of fracture in dependence of fabrication method.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;Pulse Plasma Sintered samples were characterized by higher crack resistance and higher Vickers hardness in comparison to the specimens manufactured by uniaxial pressing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Effect of the Powder Consolidation Method Type On the <org>Microstructure and Selected Properties</org> of Al2o3-cu-ni Composites. <em>Archives of Metallurgy and Materials</em>, 2020;65(2):967-974. <em>Archives of Metallurgy and Materials</em> can be contacted at: Polska Akad Nauk, Polish Acad Sciences, Inst Metall &amp; Mater <person>Sci Pas</person>, Pl, 00-901 Warszawa, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pl\">Poland</location>.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>J.
