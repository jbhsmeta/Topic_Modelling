    "text": "An Atlantic City man has been charged by federal authorities for participating\nin a riot in the casino town after an otherwise peaceful protest this week,\nthe U.S. Attorney's Office announced Thursday.\n\nCarlos A. Matchett, 30, was charged with use of a facility of interstate and\nforeign commerce with intent to participate in and carry on a riot after law\nenforcement allegedly observed him enticing people to loot and vandalize\nstores in Atlantic City after the protests on May 31.\n\nAuthorities said Matchett was also screaming obscenities at law enforcement,\nand when he was ordered to disperse, Matchett allegedly refused, leading to\nhis arrest by local police.\n\nOfficers allegedly found a knife, a hatchet and a jar filled with gasoline\ninside a backpack that he was wearing, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nShortly before his arrest, Matchett posted\n\non Facebook in response to an article about looting in Philadelphia: \"LET'S\nSTART A RIOT,\" according to officials.\n\nThe destruction of stores in Atlantic City came after hours of a peaceful\nprotest as hundreds joined in to protest the death of 46-year old George\nFloyd, who died at the hands of police in Minneapolis, as well as systemic\ninjustices that have long impacted black communities across the country.\n\nAfter the protest, a group of around 100 people congregated around the Tanger\nOutlet stores in the casino town, known as \"the Walk,\" and began smashing\nwindows at the Ralph Lauren and Timberland stores, among others, according to\npolice.\n\nAuthorities said Matchett also posted a video after the peaceful protests that\nshowed him allegedly encouraging and assisting others in the vicinity of the\noutlet stores to steal items from smashed store fronts.\n\nMatchett will make his initial appearance in court Thursday by videoconference\nbefore U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen M. Williams.\n\nHe is the second individual to be charged by federal authorities in New Jersey\nfor alleged criminal conduct at a recent protest.\n\nJustin Spry, 21, of South Plainfield, was arrested earlier this week for\nattempting to set fire to a marked police vehicle in Trenton during a protest\nover the death of Floyd.",
