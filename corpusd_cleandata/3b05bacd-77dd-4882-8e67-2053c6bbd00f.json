I could\nnever have imagined having to learn to walk at 56.\n\n\"But the team were brilliant at helping me do normal things again.\"\n\nAlayne has praised all of the staff at Nottingham University Hospitals,\nincluding the nurses who helped to arrange a surprise visit from her husband\non his birthday.\n\nShe added: \"When he came to visit it was only to the door of my room and wave\nbut it made me so happy to see him.\n\n\"I couldn't fault any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital. They were\nfantastic and looked after me so well.\n\n\"They couldn't have done enough for me and despite everything that is going\non, they were still cheery, friendly, caring and willing to do anything for\nyou.\n\n\"At first I was apprehensive about going home but despite leaving the hospital\nI have been able to call them and I know that they are still there for me if I\nneed them.\n\n\"I cannot thank the hospital enough and when the time is right, I want to go\nback and personally thank the doctors and nurses who looked after me so well.\"\n\nRebecca Selwyn, a Matron in Critical Care at Nottingham University Hospitals\nTrust, said: \"We are really looking forward to meeting Alayne when the time is\nright and to hear about her progress and what she has been up to now that she\nis back home with her family.\n\n\"It's really important to us that we keep our patients and loved-ones\nconnected during this difficult time and our team have been thinking of\ncreative ways of doing this.\n\n\"This includes utilising the technology we have to enable families to WhatsApp\nand Facetime, to encouraging a family member to come to the window of a ward\nso they can see their loved one safely.\"",

    "html": "<p>A woman who spent 40 days in hospital battling the coronavirus is now learning to walk again.</p>\n<p><person>Alayne Brown</person>, from Nottingham, fell ill in early April.</p>\n\n<p> What began as feeling dehydrated and low on energy led her to become increasingly out of breather, Nottingham post reported.</p>\n\n<p>The 56-year-old's husband Mark drove her to A&amp;E at <org>Queen's Medical Centre</org> where she was diagnosed with Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p>Alayne was given oxygen to help her breath before her health rapidly went down hill.</p>\n\n<p>She was placed in a medically induced coma in the hospitals intensive care unit, and remained unconscious for two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The staff moved really quickly and I remember them getting my husband on the phone and they asked if I wanted to speak to him one last time before I was put into the coma,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were both emotional but I&#8217;m so grateful that we were given the chance to have that call.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>To help with her breathing and so that she would wake up Alayne was given a trachestomy.</p>\n\n<p>Five weeks after she was first placed on the critical care ward she was moved to a rehabilitation ward.</p>\n\n<p>The sales woman said: \"I was able to talk with a speaker valve inserted in the tracheostomy tube after <chron>April 30</chron>, but only for short periods of time as it was very tiring.</p>\n\n<p>\"Then when it was removed I was able to talk normally again and eat ice cream.\"</p>\n\n<p>From the length of time she spent in bed, Alayne needed support getting back to doing everyday things again and building up strength.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I lost a lot of my confidence and I had also lot a lot of my muscle from being in the hospital bed for so long,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>\"My phone felt like a heavy weight.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was unable to lift my legs up in bed or stand up, let alone walk. I could never have imagined having to learn to walk at 56.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;But the team were brilliant at helping me do normal things again.\"</p>\n\n<p> Alayne has praised all of the staff at Nottingham University Hospitals, including the nurses who helped to arrange a surprise visit from her husband on his birthday.</p>\n\n<p>She added: \"When he came to visit it was only to the door of my room and wave but it made me so happy to see him.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t fault any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital. They were fantastic and looked after me so well.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t have done enough for me and despite everything that is going on, they were still cheery, friendly, caring and willing to do anything for you.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;At first I was apprehensive about going home but despite leaving the hospital I have been able to call them and I know that they are still there for me if I need them.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I cannot thank the hospital enough and when the time is right, I want to go back and personally thank the doctors and nurses who looked after me so well.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p><person>Rebecca Selwyn</person>, a Matron in Critical Care at <org>Nottingham University Hospitals Trust</org>, said: &#8220;We are really looking forward to meeting Alayne when the time is right and to hear about her progress and what she has been up to now that she is back home with her family.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to us that we keep our patients and loved-ones connected during this difficult time and our team have been thinking of creative ways of doing this.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This includes utilising the technology we have to enable families to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2768321335\">WhatsApp</org> and Facetime, to encouraging a family member to come to the window of a ward so they can see their loved one safely.&#8221;</p>",
