    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Immunotherapy\nDaily \\-- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our\njournalists obtained the following quote sourced from\n[medrxiv.org](http://medrxiv.org):\n\n\"COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2\n(SAR-CoV-2), resulting in symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of\nbreath. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been suggested to initiate a cytokine\nstorm in patients with COVID-19 evidenced by elevated cytokines, such as\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).\n\n\"We report preliminary data from 21 patients with COVID-19 who developed\npneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and participated in a\ncompassionate-use program at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy.\nAll 21 patients received intravenous siltuximab, a chimeric mAb that binds to\nand blocks the effect of IL-6, at a dose ranging between 700 to 1,200 mg\n(median 900 mg). The median age of patients treated was 64 years, and all\npatients were followed for a median of eight days. Serum CRP levels reduced in\nall 16 patients with available data following treatment. An improvement in the\nclinical condition was observed in 33% (7/21) of patients, 43% (9/21) of\npatients stabilized as evidenced by no clinically relevant change in their\ncondition, and 24% (5/21) experienced a worsening in their condition. Of those\npatients who experienced a worsening in their condition, one patient died, and\none patient experienced a cerebrovascular event.\n\n\"This analysis is presented to inform the medical community of the potential\nrole of siltuximab in treating patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2\ninfection, and a cohort study with patients treated with standard therapy in\nour hospital is ongoing, and will report the 30-day mortality rates upon\ncompletion.\"\n\nThis preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Immunotherapy Daily</org> -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from <a href=\"http://medrxiv.org\">medrxiv.org</a>:</p>\n<p>&#8220;COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2), resulting in symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been suggested to initiate a cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 evidenced by elevated cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).</p>\n<p>&#8220;We report preliminary data from 21 patients with COVID-19 who developed pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and participated in a compassionate-use program at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/it.bg\">Bergamo, Italy</location>. All 21 patients received intravenous siltuximab, a chimeric mAb that binds to and blocks the effect of IL-6, at a dose ranging between 700 to 1,200 mg (median 900 mg). The median age of patients treated was 64 years, and all patients were followed for a median of eight days. Serum CRP levels reduced in all 16 patients with available data following treatment. An improvement in the clinical condition was observed in 33% (7/21) of patients, 43% (9/21) of patients stabilized as evidenced by no clinically relevant change in their condition, and 24% (5/21) experienced a worsening in their condition. Of those patients who experienced a worsening in their condition, one patient died, and one patient experienced a cerebrovascular event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This analysis is presented to inform the medical community of the potential role of siltuximab in treating patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a cohort study with patients treated with standard therapy in our hospital is ongoing, and will report the 30-day mortality rates upon completion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.
