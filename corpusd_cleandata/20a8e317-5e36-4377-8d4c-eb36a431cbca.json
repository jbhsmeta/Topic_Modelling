    "text": "Rising demand for plant-based alternative meat and dairy products may not be\nthe biggest problem facing conventional meat and dairy producers. New research\nby The Hartman Group, Bellevue, Wash., uncovered that almost all consumers--\nwhether they purchase plant-based foods or not--have some level of distrust in\nmeat and dairy companies/producers.\n\nAccording to Hartman Group's \"Food &C Technology 2019: From Plant-based to\nLab-grown\" report, the majority of consumers see plant-based alternatives as\nno different or better than conventional meat and dairy when it comes to being\nall natural, minimally processed, healthy and good for the environment and\nanimals. This is true regardless of the plant-based category.\n\n\"Factory farming and its abuses have made consumers question the ethics of\neating animal products; popular documentaries have eroded trust in the\nmeat/dairy industries,\" said Laurie Demeritt, CEO of The Hartman Group. \"The\nupside for the industries is that for the vast majority of consumers, meat and\ndairy still represent highly symbolic, routine, and pleasurable categories.\"\n\nFood & Technology 2019 finds that milk, meat, and dairy alternatives are\ngrowing swiftly, while meat is growing slowly and milk is in decline. More\nthan half of consumers (51%) have purchased plant-based milk, dairy, or meat\nin the last three months. These products are no longer a niche lifestyle\nchoice but a prominent feature of mainstream food culture.\n\nPlant-based purchasing today is happening in a cultural atmosphere that is\nvery different from the moralistic, sustainability-driven vegetarianism of the\n1970s. Less than half of plant-based purchasers today think of themselves as\npeople who are limiting meat, and one in five actually describes themselves as\ncarnivores.\n\nMore recently, The Hartman Group blogged about consumer interest in \"blended\"\nburgers that contain a mix of both meat and plant-based ingredients (see\ngraphic). Interested consumers felt that this compromise would be likely to\ngive them most of the flavor of meat that they crave but also allow them to\neat in alignment with their health and ethical aspirations.\n\nVisit [www.hartman-group.com](http://www.hartman-group.com) to learn more\nabout the Food & Technology 2019: From Plant-based to Lab-grown report.\n\nMore recently, The Hartman Group addressed consumers' more \"ethical\naspirations.\" After its 2009 (post recession) review of consumer attitudes\ntoward sustainability, company researchers came back this October 2019 with a\nnew report titled, \"Sustainability 2019: Beyond Business as Usual.\"\n\nDemeritt says the new report finds that today's consumers are confronted by\nreal and immediate sustainability challenges. Crises no longer seem far away\nin time or space-even abstract problems like climate change and the permanence\nof plastic waste have become pressing and present for consumers across\nsegments, and they want progress and solutions.\n\nIn this tense national mood, consumers appear to be more willing to prioritize\nthe greater good in their purchasing than in the past. In a major shift, 51%\nof consumers now report the environment as their major reason for purchasing\nsustainable or socially responsible products compared to 32% of consumers just\ntwo years ago.\n\nEditor's Note: This story originally published in Prepared Foods, a sister\npublication of The National Provisioner in the BNP Media portfolio.

    "html": "<p>Rising demand for plant-based alternative meat and dairy products\nmay not be the biggest problem facing conventional meat and dairy\nproducers. New research by <org>The Hartman Group</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wa.belvue\">Bellevue, Wash.</location>, uncovered\nthat almost all consumers--whether they purchase plant-based foods or\nnot--have some level of distrust in meat and dairy companies/producers.</p>\n\n<p>According to <org>Hartman Group's</org> \"Food &amp;C Technology\n2019: From Plant-based to Lab-grown\" report, the majority of\nconsumers see plant-based alternatives as no different or better than\nconventional meat and dairy when it comes to being all natural,\nminimally processed, healthy and good for the environment and animals.\nThis is true regardless of the plant-based category.</p>\n\n<p>\"Factory farming and its abuses have made consumers question\nthe ethics of eating animal products; popular documentaries have eroded\ntrust in the meat/dairy industries,\" said <person>Laurie Demeritt</person>, CEO of\n<org>The Hartman Group</org>. \"The upside for the industries is that for the\nvast majority of consumers, meat and dairy still represent highly\nsymbolic, routine, and pleasurable categories.\"</p>\n\n<p>Food &amp; Technology 2019 finds that milk, meat, and dairy\nalternatives are growing swiftly, while meat is growing slowly and milk\nis in decline. More than half of consumers (51%) have purchased\nplant-based milk, dairy, or meat in the last three months. These\nproducts are no longer a niche lifestyle choice but a prominent feature\nof mainstream food culture.</p>\n\n<p>Plant-based purchasing today is happening in a cultural atmosphere\nthat is very different from the moralistic, sustainability-driven\nvegetarianism of the 1970s. Less than half of plant-based purchasers\ntoday think of themselves as people who are limiting meat, and one in\nfive actually describes themselves as carnivores.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, <org>The Hartman Group</org> blogged about consumer interest in\n\"blended\" burgers that contain a mix of both meat and\nplant-based ingredients (see graphic). Interested consumers felt that\nthis compromise would be likely to give them most of the flavor of meat\nthat they crave but also allow them to eat in alignment with their\nhealth and ethical aspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.hartman-group.com\">www.hartman-group.com</a> to learn more about the Food &amp;\nTechnology 2019: From Plant-based to Lab-grown report.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, <org>The Hartman Group</org> addressed consumers' more\n\"ethical aspirations.\" After its 2009 (post recession) review\nof consumer attitudes toward sustainability, company researchers came\nback this <chron>October 2019</chron> with a new report titled, \"Sustainability\n2019: Beyond Business as Usual.\"</p>\n\n<p>Demeritt says the new report finds that today's consumers are\nconfronted by real and immediate sustainability challenges. Crises no\nlonger seem far away in time or space-even abstract problems like\nclimate change and the permanence of plastic waste have become pressing\nand present for consumers across segments, and they want progress and\nsolutions.</p>\n\n<p>In this tense national mood, consumers appear to be more willing to\nprioritize the greater good in their purchasing than in the past. In a\nmajor shift, 51% of consumers now report the environment as their major\nreason for purchasing sustainable or socially responsible products\ncompared to 32% of consumers just two years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Editor's Note: This story originally published in <org>Prepared\nFoods</org>, a sister publication of The National Provisioner in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3794808197\">BNP Media</org>\nportfolio.
