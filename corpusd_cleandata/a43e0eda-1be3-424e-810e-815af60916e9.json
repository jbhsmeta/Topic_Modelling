    "text": "By David Bol\n\nCRIMINAL trials could be conducted without a jury and left in the hands of\njudges under emergency proposals, while prisoners could be released early if\njails become overwhelmed by cases of coronavirus.\n\nThe early release of prisoners would only be used as a last resort, while\njudge-only trials would only be considered for the most serious criminal\ncharges.\n\nHolyrood will consider the emergency powers today, while the English and Welsh\ncourts have delayed cases that require juries until they can be conducted\nsafely.\n\nThe Scottish Criminal Bar Association (SCBA) has criticised some of the\nmeasures, labelling them \"draconian\".\n\nRonnie Renucci QC, president of the SCBA, said: \"The proposals in this Bill\ninclude attacks on principles that have been built over 600 years and are at\nthe very cornerstone of Scotland's criminal justice system and democratic\ntradition.\n\n\"Any changes, however temporary, should not erode important principles of our\nlegal system which would have the effect of undermining or ignoring the\ncitizen's rights to justice.\n\n\"The SCBA believes that these draconian measures seeking to bring about\nseismic changes to our system of justice are premature, disproportionate and\nill-advised.\"\n\nLaw Society of Scotland president John Mulholland, warned that introducing\ntrials with no jury would be \"one of the most fundamental changes to our\njustice system ever contemplated\".\n\nHe added: \"It is therefore essential that we seek the views of those most\ndirectly affected by this change and closely scrutinise, monitor and review\nall of the measures being proposed.\"\n\nThe Bill itself does not give MSPs the power to release prisoners, with the\nfinal decision being made by a second vote on who should be released.\n\nOther provisions will also be made across the legal system for more hearings\nto take place remotely.\n\nIf approved, the new powers would expire on September 30 this year, although\nMSPs have the option to extend the legislation for a further two six-month\nperiods, should it be deemed necessary to do so to tackle the coronavirus\npandemic.\n\nConstitution Secretary Mike Russell said: \"Some of these measures are about\nthe continuing function of the justice system and public services to maintain\npublic confidence and to keep our communities safe.\"\n\nHe added: \"For example, we cannot simply summon juries at present - that would\nbe completely impossible.\n\n\"The procedure to have solemn trials without a jury is in the Bill, but there\nare many safeguards. These are exceptional powers and, if they are used, they\nhave to be used exceptionally carefully.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats and Conservatives will oppose the no-jury trials when MSPs\ndebate the proposals today.\n\nThe emergency legislation also includes extending the notice period for\ntenants to be evicted, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said would\n\"effectively mean that nobody can be evicted during this emergency crisis\nperiod\".\n\nThe current three-month notice period for tenants to be evicted will be\ntemporarily doubled to six months.\n\nAlison Watson, director of Shelter Scotland, said: \"Shelter Scotland welcomes\nthe legislation on evictions that is due to go through parliament today.\n\n\"It will go some way to reassuring people who are worried about losing their\nhomes at a time when we're all being told to stay home to save lives. We still\nhave some concerns about possible illegal evictions and we think the\ngovernment and councils should be advising landlords that anyone who evicts\nsomeone illegally just now will be putting their registration at risk.\"\n\nCREDIT: David Bol",

    "html": "<p>By <person>David Bol</person></p>\n<p>CRIMINAL trials could be conducted without a jury and left in the hands of judges under emergency proposals, while prisoners could be released early if jails become overwhelmed by cases of coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The early release of prisoners would only be used as a last resort, while judge-only trials would only be considered for the most serious criminal charges.</p>\n<p>Holyrood will consider the emergency powers today, while the English and Welsh courts have delayed cases that require juries until they can be conducted safely.</p>\n<p><org>The Scottish Criminal Bar Association</org> (SCBA) has criticised some of the measures, labelling them &#8220;draconian&#8221;.</p>\n<p><person>Ronnie Renucci QC</person>, president of the SCBA, said: &#8220;The proposals in this Bill include attacks on principles that have been built over 600 years and are at the very cornerstone of Scotland&#8217;s criminal justice system and democratic tradition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Any changes, however temporary, should not erode important principles of our legal system which would have the effect of undermining or ignoring the citizen&#8217;s rights to justice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The SCBA believes that these draconian measures seeking to bring about seismic changes to our system of justice are premature, disproportionate and ill-advised.&#8221;</p>\n<p><org>Law Society of Scotland</org> president <person>John Mulholland</person>, warned that introducing trials with no jury would be &#8220;one of the most fundamental changes to our justice system ever contemplated&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;It is therefore essential that we seek the views of those most directly affected by this change and closely scrutinise, monitor and review all of the measures being proposed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Bill itself does not give MSPs the power to release prisoners, with the final decision being made by a second vote on who should be released.</p>\n<p>Other provisions will also be made across the legal system for more hearings to take place remotely.</p>\n<p>If approved, the new powers would expire on <chron>September 30</chron> this year, although MSPs have the option to extend the legislation for a further two six-month periods, should it be deemed necessary to do so to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>Constitution Secretary <person>Mike Russell</person> said: &#8220;Some of these measures are about the continuing function of the justice system and public services to maintain public confidence and to keep our communities safe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;For example, we cannot simply summon juries at present &#8211; that would be completely impossible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The procedure to have solemn trials without a jury is in the Bill, but there are many safeguards. These are exceptional powers and, if they are used, they have to be used exceptionally carefully.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Liberal <org>Democrats</org> and Conservatives will oppose the no-jury trials when MSPs debate the proposals today.</p>\n<p>The emergency legislation also includes extending the notice period for tenants to be evicted, which First Minister <person>Nicola Sturgeon</person> said would &#8220;effectively mean that nobody can be evicted during this emergency crisis period&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The current three-month notice period for tenants to be evicted will be temporarily doubled to six months.</p>\n<p><person>Alison Watson</person>, director of Shelter Scotland, said: &#8220;Shelter Scotland welcomes the legislation on evictions that is due to go through parliament today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will go some way to reassuring people who are worried about losing their homes at a time when we&#8217;re all being told to stay home to save lives. We still have some concerns about possible illegal evictions and we think the government and councils should be advising landlords that anyone who evicts someone illegally just now will be putting their registration at risk.&#8221;</p><p>CREDIT: <person>David Bol</person></p>",
