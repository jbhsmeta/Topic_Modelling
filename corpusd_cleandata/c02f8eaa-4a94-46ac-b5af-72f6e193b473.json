She was the historian for the Class of 2020 and the National Honor\nSociety, and the Student Council treasurer.\n\nThat was all in addition to her participation in the high school's musical\nproductions, and doing the morning announcements for two years.\n\n\"She's been a part of our morning routine,\" Principal Dayton Handrick said.\n\"She's (also) a big part of our drama and music departments.\"\n\nAfter an unusual senior year, Garrison will graduate from SHS tonight.\n\n\"(It's nice) just being able to officially graduate instead of doing it online\nor nothing at all,\" she said. \"I'm excited to actually do it and be with my\nclass.\"\n\nWhile she said it was difficult not being at school, it also had its\npositives.\n\n\"It's definitely been hard,\" she said. \"But I feel like I've gotten closer\nwith my teachers and my classmates, just trying to get through it together.\"\n\nIn the fall, Garrison will attend Bloomsburg University and major in early\nchildhood education.\n\n\"I've always had a passion for helping people, and I love kids, so honestly it\nwas just a good major for me,\" Garrison said.\n\nGarrison said she drew inspiration from her teachers in choosing to pursue the\ncareer.\n\n\"Growing up, I feel like teachers were definitely my biggest influence and\nthose who helped me the most in life, so I want to be able to help other kids\nas they grow up,\" she said.\n\nGrowing up in a military family, and living as far away as Alaska, Garrison\nsaid one of the things she appreciated most about her time in Sayre was being\nable to stay in one place.\n\n\"I've grown up literally (everywhere),\" she said, \"Just being able to spend\nfour years in one solid place, where I'm able to have a great foundation\nbecause it's such a little school has been amazing for me. It really is a\nlittle school with a big heart, because it's so welcoming and amazing.\"\n\nNow, she is looking forward to the next stage of her life.\n\n\"I'm really excited to further my education and be able to start a life on my\nown, and blossom as a person,\" she said. \"I just want to say thank you to\nSayre and the school for being so helpful and honest, working with the\nofficers  and (coming) together for such an amazing ceremony.\"\n\nSayre High will hold its graduation at Riverfront Park tonight beginning at 6\np.m. Only the graduate's families - two carloads per student - will be able to\nattend the ceremony. The graduation will be live streamed on the school\ndistrict's Facebook page and website as well as broadcast on Choice 102 (102.1\nFM).",

    "html": "<p><person>Alex Garrison</person> has accumulated a long list of achievements during her time at <org>Sayre High School</org>.</p>\n<p>Garrison was the captain of the cheer team, as well as the speech and debate team. She was the historian for the Class of 2020 and the <org>National Honor Society</org>, and the <org>Student Council</org> treasurer.</p>\n\n<p>That was all in addition to her participation in the high school's musical productions, and doing the morning announcements for two years.</p>\n\n<p>\"She's been a part of our morning routine,\" Principal <person>Dayton Handrick</person> said. \"She's (also) a big part of our drama and music departments.\"</p>\n\n<p>After an unusual senior year, Garrison will graduate from SHS tonight.</p>\n\n<p>\"(It's nice) just being able to officially graduate instead of doing it online or nothing at all,\" she said. \"I'm excited to actually do it and be with my class.\"</p>\n\n<p>While she said it was difficult not being at school, it also had its positives.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's definitely been hard,\" she said. \"But I feel like I've gotten closer with my teachers and my classmates, just trying to get through it together.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the fall, Garrison will attend <org>Bloomsburg University</org> and major in early childhood education.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've always had a passion for helping people, and I love kids, so honestly it was just a good major for me,\" Garrison said.</p>\n\n<p>Garrison said she drew inspiration from her teachers in choosing to pursue the career.</p>\n\n<p>\"Growing up, I feel like teachers were definitely my biggest influence and those who helped me the most in life, so I want to be able to help other kids as they grow up,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Growing up in a military family, and living as far away as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ak\">Alaska</location>, Garrison said one of the things she appreciated most about her time in Sayre was being able to stay in one place.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've grown up literally (everywhere),\" she said, \"Just being able to spend four years in one solid place, where I'm able to have a great foundation because it's such a little school has been amazing for me. It really is a little school with a big heart, because it's so welcoming and amazing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, she is looking forward to the next stage of her life.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm really excited to further my education and be able to start a life on my own, and blossom as a person,\" she said. \"I just want to say thank you to Sayre and the school for being so helpful and honest, working with the officers &#133; and (coming) together for such an amazing ceremony.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>Sayre High</org> will hold its graduation at <location>Riverfront Park</location> tonight beginning at <chron>6 p.m.</chron> Only the graduate's families - two carloads per student - will be able to attend the ceremony. The graduation will be live streamed on the school district's Facebook page and website as well as broadcast on Choice 102 (102.1 FM).</p>",
