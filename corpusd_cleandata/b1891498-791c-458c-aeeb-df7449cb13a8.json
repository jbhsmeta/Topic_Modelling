Bob Casey will donate plasma to help COVID-19 patients after testing\npositive for antibodies of the virus.\n\nCasey, D-Lackawanna County, said he received the results of the antibody test\non Wednesday.\n\n\"This positive test means that I likely had COVID-19 at some point over the\nlast several months and have since developed an antibody response to the\nvirus,\" he said on Friday.\n\nCasey noted that earlier in the spring he had a low-grade fever and mild, flu-\nlike symptoms. After consulting with his doctor, he self-quarantined for two\nweeks at his Scranton home.\n\nHe said the symptoms were \"relatively mild and manageable,\" so he did not seek\nadditional care, and it was never recommended that he be tested for COVID-19.\n\n\"I was able to work during my illness, remotely engaging with constituents and\nstaff and keeping a full schedule,\" Casey said.\n\nThe capitol's attending physician recommended the antibody test to determine\nif he had the virus and whether he would be a candidate to donate plasma.\n\nCasey said he had \"substantial levels of COVID-19 antibody in my blood,\nsignificantly more than the amount required to qualify me as a plasma donor.\"\n\nHe said he made his first plasma donation on Friday, and encouraged others who\nhave recovered from the virus to see if they, too, can donate plasma.\n\nUnlike tests for active infections, antibody tests are blood tests that can\ndetect whether someone was infected at some point in the past.",

After consulting with his doctor, he self-quarantined for two weeks at his Scranton home.</p>\n\n<p>He said the symptoms were \"relatively mild and manageable,\" so he did not seek additional care, and it was never recommended that he be tested for COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>\"I was able to work during my illness, remotely engaging with constituents and staff and keeping a full schedule,\" Casey said.</p>\n\n<p>The capitol's attending physician recommended the antibody test to determine if he had the virus and whether he would be a candidate to donate plasma.</p>\n\n<p>Casey said he had \"substantial levels of COVID-19 antibody in my blood, significantly more than the amount required to qualify me as a plasma donor.\"</p>\n\n<p>He said he made his first plasma donation on Friday, and encouraged others who have recovered from the virus to see if they, too, can donate plasma.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike tests for active infections, antibody tests are blood tests that can detect whether someone was infected at some point in the past.</p>",
