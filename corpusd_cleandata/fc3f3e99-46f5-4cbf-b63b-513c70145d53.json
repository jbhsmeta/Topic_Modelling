    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at China Business\nDay -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by\nNewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventors LI, Zhaofeng (Wuxi,\nChina); GU, Zhengbiao (Wuxi, China); WANG, Zhe (Wuxi, China); LI, Caiming\n(Wuxi, China); XU, Sijia (Wuxi, China); CHENG, Li (Wuxi, China); HONG, Yan\n(Wuxi, China), filed on January 20, 2020, was made available online on May 21,\n2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent application is Jiangnan University (Wuxi,\nPeople's Republic of China).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Maltodextrin, also known as water-soluble dextrin\nor enzymatic dextrin, is a starch hydrolysate obtained by an acid process or\nenzymatic treatment. The main components of maltodextrin are dextrin,\npolysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and also a small amount of maltose and\nglucose. The DE value (reducing sugar equivalent) is usually used to indicate\nthe degree of starch degradation, and conventional maltodextrin is a starch\nhydrolysate with a DE value less than 20. In recent years, maltodextrin has\nbeen widely used in the food industry. When the DE value is 2-4, maltodextrin\ncan produce the texture and taste of fat, and can be used as a fat substitute\nfor moon cake, salad, ice cream, sausage, and the like. When the DE value is\n5-7, maltodextrin has the characteristics of low sweetness, low\nhygroscopicity, good film-forming property, and the like, and can be used as a\nthickener, a stabilizer, a filler, a carrier, and the like in foods. When the\nDE value is 9-12, maltodextrin is not easily damp, is difficult to brown, and\ncan be used in food to improve the touch of the food and produce high\nviscosity. When the DE value is 15-20, maltodextrin has high fluidity, good\nsolubility and suitable viscosity, and can be applied to candy, beverage,\nconvenience food and canned food.\n\n\"At present, the production of maltodextrin at home and abroad is carried out\nby an enzymatic process, and the acid process has been basically eliminated.\nHowever, the maltodextrin produced by the traditional enzymatic process has\ncertain limitations. The maltodextrin has a high linear molecular content, and\nmacromolecular polymerization will show a tendency to retrogradation during\nstorage, thereby making a solution turbid. Since many manufacturers still\ncannot overcome the phenomenon of dextrin retrogradation, domestic\nmaltodextrin products still have a big gap compared with some similar products\nabroad, and thus the products are greatly limited in production and\napplication.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx editors also obtained the inventors' summary information for this\npatent application: \"In order to solve the above problems, the disclosure\nintroduces a starch branching enzyme (1,4-.alpha.-glucan branching enzyme; EC\n2.4.1.18) derived from Rhodothermus obamensis based on a traditional enzymatic\nproduction process of maltodextrin. The starch branching enzyme is able to\ncatalyze the cleavage of .alpha.-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch molecules,\nresulting in short chains with non-reducing ends. The cleaved short chain is\nligated to a receptor chain in an .alpha.-1,6-glycosidic bond form by\ntransglycosylation to form an .alpha.-1,6-branch point, thereby completing a\nbranching process. Thereby, the stability of the maltodextrin is enhanced, the\nmaltodextrin is not easy to retrograde, and the freeze-thaw stability of the\nmaltodextrin is also improved. The method of the disclosure can produce high-\nquality maltodextrin with good solubility and high transparency, good\nviscosity stability and good freeze-thaw stability during storage, and\nimproves the commodity value of the maltodextrin.\n\n\"The disclosure provides a method for producing high-quality maltodextrin,\nsequentially comprising the following steps: slurry preparation, spray\nliquefaction, action of Rhodothermus obamensis-derived starch branching\nenzyme, filtration, decolorization, ion exchange and concentration.\n\n\"In an embodiment of the disclosure, the method further comprises a spray\ndrying step.\n\n\"In an embodiment of the disclosure, the method is specifically as follows:\n\n\"(1) slurry preparation: preparing starch milk of a certain concentration from\nstarch, heating and insulating for a period of time, adding high temperature\nresistant .alpha.-amylase and calcium chloride, and adjusting pH after uniform\nstirring;\n\n\"(2) spray liquefaction: carrying out spraying with a low pressure steam spray\nliquefier;\n\n\"(3) starch branching enzyme action: after liquefied liquid in (2) is cooled,\nadding the starch branching enzyme, adjusting the pH, carrying out a reaction\nat a certain temperature for a period of time, and carrying out enzyme\ndeactivation by heating to obtain reaction liquid;\n\n\"(4) filtration: after the reaction liquid is cooled, carrying out filtration\nto obtain a settled solution;\n\n\"(5) decolorization: adjusting the pH of the solution, adding activated\ncarbon, and stirring the solution for decolorization at a certain temperature\nfor a period of time;\n\n\"(6) ion exchange: removing metal salt and pigment from the solution using ion\nexchange resin;\n\n\"(7) concentration: concentrating the solution under a certain vacuum degree\nand temperature.\n\n\"In an embodiment of the disclosure, the starch in the (1) is one or more of\ncommon maize starch, tapioca starch, potato starch, waxy maize starch, sweet\npotato starch, rice starch or wheat starch; the concentration of the starch\nmilk is 5-45%; the starch milk is heated to 60-70.degree.

In the\ndisclosure, on the basis of an enzymatic production process of maltodextrin,\nthe starch branching enzyme derived from Rhodothermus obamensis is introduced\nto improve the branching degree, and the produced maltodextrin has good\nsolubility and high transparency, good viscosity stability and improved\nfreeze-thaw stability during storage. For the maltodextrin of DE 10, the\nmaltodextrin obtained by the disclosure dissolves faster than maltodextrin\nproduced by the conventional method, the transparency can be increased from\n0.2% to 97.6% when stored for 60 d, and the viscosity during storage is very\nstable, which can meet the market demand. In addition, for the maltodextrin of\nDE 5, the method of the disclosure can increase the transparency from 1.7% to\n38.2% after 5 freeze-thaw cycles without changing the DE value. For the\nmaltodextrin of DE 10, the method of the disclosure can increase the\ntransparency from 4.1% to 96.8% after 5 freeze-thaw cycles without changing\nthe DE value. For the maltodextrin of DE 15, the method of the disclosure can\nincrease the transparency from 52.1% to 97.7% after 5 freeze-thaw cycles\nwithout changing the DE value.\n\n\"The disclosure has the following four advantages compared with the effect of\ntreatment with the starch branching enzyme derived from G. thermoglucosidans:\n(1) the disclosure broadens the range of DE values of the modifiable\nmaltodextrin, and the starch branching enzyme derived from Rhodothermus\nobamensis and acting on the maltodextrin with a DE value of 2-20 can\nsignificantly improve the dissolution rate, and transparency and viscosity\nstability during storage, of the maltodextrin; (2) the maltodextrin obtained\nby the disclosure has obvious effects when stored at room temperature and in a\nrefrigerated (4.degree. C.) state; (3) the maltodextrin obtained by the\ndisclosure can maintain improved transparency for a long time, the\ntransparencies of the maltodextrin with DE values of 5, 10 and 15 are 99.8%,\n99.8% and 99.9% respectively when stored at 4.degree. C. for 10 d, and after\nstorage for 60 d, the transparency can still reach 53.7%, 97.6% and 98.7%,\nwhich is obviously better than the modification effect of the starch branching\nenzyme derived from G. thermoglucosidans; and (4) the maltodextrin obtained by\nthe disclosure not only has improved transparency and viscosity stability, but\nalso has a faster dissolution rate.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\.

The main components of maltodextrin are dextrin, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and also a small amount of maltose and glucose. The DE value (reducing sugar equivalent) is usually used to indicate the degree of starch degradation, and conventional maltodextrin is a starch hydrolysate with a DE value less than 20. In recent years, maltodextrin has been widely used in the food industry. When the DE value is 2-4, maltodextrin can produce the texture and taste of fat, and can be used as a fat substitute for moon cake, salad, ice cream, sausage, and the like. When the DE value is 5-7, maltodextrin has the characteristics of low sweetness, low hygroscopicity, good film-forming property, and the like, and can be used as a thickener, a stabilizer, a filler, a carrier, and the like in foods. When the DE value is 9-12, maltodextrin is not easily damp, is difficult to brown, and can be used in food to improve the touch of the food and produce high viscosity. When the DE value is 15-20, maltodextrin has high fluidity, good solubility and suitable viscosity, and can be applied to candy, beverage, convenience food and canned food.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At present, the production of maltodextrin at home and abroad is carried out by an enzymatic process, and the acid process has been basically eliminated. However, the maltodextrin produced by the traditional enzymatic process has certain limitations. The maltodextrin has a high linear molecular content, and macromolecular polymerization will show a tendency to retrogradation during storage, thereby making a solution turbid. Since many manufacturers still cannot overcome the phenomenon of dextrin retrogradation, domestic maltodextrin products still have a big gap compared with some similar products abroad, and thus the products are greatly limited in production and application.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;In order to solve the above problems, the disclosure introduces a starch branching enzyme (1,4-.alpha.-glucan branching enzyme; EC 2.4.1.18) derived from Rhodothermus obamensis based on a traditional enzymatic production process of maltodextrin. The starch branching enzyme is able to catalyze the cleavage of .alpha.-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch molecules, resulting in short chains with non-reducing ends. The cleaved short chain is ligated to a receptor chain in an .alpha.-1,6-glycosidic bond form by transglycosylation to form an .alpha.-1,6-branch point, thereby completing a branching process. Thereby, the stability of the maltodextrin is enhanced, the maltodextrin is not easy to retrograde, and the freeze-thaw stability of the maltodextrin is also improved. The method of the disclosure can produce high-quality maltodextrin with good solubility and high transparency, good viscosity stability and good freeze-thaw stability during storage, and improves the commodity value of the maltodextrin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The disclosure provides a method for producing high-quality maltodextrin, sequentially comprising the following steps: slurry preparation, spray liquefaction, action of Rhodothermus obamensis-derived starch branching enzyme, filtration, decolorization, ion exchange and concentration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In an embodiment of the disclosure, the method further comprises a spray drying step.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In an embodiment of the disclosure, the method is specifically as follows:</p>\n<p>&#8220;(1) slurry preparation: preparing starch milk of a certain concentration from starch, heating and insulating for a period of time, adding high temperature resistant .alpha.-amylase and calcium chloride, and adjusting pH after uniform stirring;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(2) spray liquefaction: carrying out spraying with a low pressure steam spray liquefier;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(3) starch branching enzyme action: after liquefied liquid in (2) is cooled, adding the starch branching enzyme, adjusting the pH, carrying out a reaction at a certain temperature for a period of time, and carrying out enzyme deactivation by heating to obtain reaction liquid;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(4) filtration: after the reaction liquid is cooled, carrying out filtration to obtain a settled solution;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(5) decolorization: adjusting the pH of the solution, adding activated <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1793631966\">carbon</org>, and stirring the solution for decolorization at a certain temperature for a period of time;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(6) ion exchange: removing metal salt and pigment from the solution using ion exchange resin;</p>\n<p>&#8220;(7) concentration: concentrating the solution under a certain vacuum degree and temperature.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In an embodiment of the disclosure, the starch in the (1) is one or more of common maize starch, tapioca starch, potato starch, waxy maize starch, sweet potato starch, rice starch or wheat starch; the concentration of the starch milk is 5-45%; the starch milk is heated to 60-70.degree.

For the maltodextrin of DE 10, the method of the disclosure can increase the transparency from 4.1% to 96.8% after 5 freeze-thaw cycles without changing the DE value. For the maltodextrin of DE 15, the method of the disclosure can increase the transparency from 52.1% to 97.7% after 5 freeze-thaw cycles without changing the DE value.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The disclosure has the following four advantages compared with the effect of treatment with the starch branching enzyme derived from G. thermoglucosidans: (1) the disclosure broadens the range of DE values of the modifiable maltodextrin, and the starch branching enzyme derived from Rhodothermus obamensis and acting on the maltodextrin with a DE value of 2-20 can significantly improve the dissolution rate, and transparency and viscosity stability during storage, of the maltodextrin; (2) the maltodextrin obtained by the disclosure has obvious effects when stored at room temperature and in a refrigerated (4.degree. C.) state; (3) the maltodextrin obtained by the disclosure can maintain improved transparency for a long time, the transparencies of the maltodextrin with DE values of 5, 10 and 15 are 99.8%, 99.8% and 99.9% respectively when stored at 4.degree. C. for 10 d, and after storage for 60 d, the transparency can still reach 53.7%, 97.6% and 98.7%, which is obviously better than the modification effect of the starch branching enzyme derived from G. thermoglucosidans; and (4) the maltodextrin obtained by the disclosure not only has improved transparency and viscosity stability, but also has a faster dissolution rate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
