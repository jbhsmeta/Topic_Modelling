    "text": "MUSCATINE \u0096 After discussion of an amended 28E agreement with the Eastern Iowa\nMental Health and Disability Services Region, the Muscatine County board of\nSupervisors held off on voting on the governmental agreement until addressing\nseveral concerns.\n\nDuring the discussion at the regular supervisor meeting Monday morning, region\nCEO Lori Elam said the main changes in the agreement are three new members on\nthe governing board as well as new personnel to provide services. She also\nsaid some of the new members of the board will be ex officio members. The\nboard will also use a weighted voting process during meetings. The agreement\nalso discussed when leadership roles on the board would be elected.\n\n\"The main reason the 28E agreement is being amended is because of the\nchildren's behavioral health bill that was passed in May 2019,\" Elam said.\n\"The regions, starting Jan. 1, will be providing access or information and\nreferral and ensuring services are available to children with a diagnosis of\nserious emotional disorders.\"\n\nElam said a policy was also being written regarding internal disputes that\nwould be added to the agreement later. Last year Muscatine County had voted to\nleave the region, only to be denied admittance by the South East Iowa Link\nregion. The Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) had assigned Muscatine\nCounty back to the Eastern Iowa region after the governing board had denied\nre-admittance.\n\nSupervisor Nathan Mather, also an attorney, asked several questions regarding\nthe new agreement. He asked for clarification on the section dealing with re-\nappointment of directors. Elam said the appointments were made by the advisory\ncommittees and that most of the changes to the agreement were being done as a\nresult of DHS mandates.\n\n\"They are tying our hands once again,\" Elam said. \"Maybe this will change next\nyear as we discuss legislation regarding the children's bill and all of the\nrequirements that came with it.\"\n\nMather also asked if the board was just a \"rubber stamp\" and had to approve\nany nomination made by the advisory committees. Elam responded \"it does appear\nso, yes.\"\n\nThere were a few other clarifications Mather asked for, including how votes\nwere taken. He commented with the weighted vote and the additional members,\neach vote taken by the governing board would have 18 votes. Elam said the\nquestions would be brought up to the governing board.\n\nElam asked supervisor chair Jeff Sorensen to contact governing board chair Ken\nBeck regarding the concerns of the agreement. Sorensen said he would contact\nBeck that afternoon and that the supervisors would vote on the agreement\nduring its June 15 meeting.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.musine\">MUSCATINE</location> &#150; After discussion of an amended 28E agreement with the <org>Eastern Iowa Mental Health</org> and <location>Disability Services Region</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.musine\">Muscatine County</location> board of Supervisors held off on voting on the governmental agreement until addressing several concerns.</p>\n<p>During the discussion at the regular supervisor meeting Monday morning, region CEO <person>Lori Elam</person> said the main changes in the agreement are three new members on the governing board as well as new personnel to provide services. She also said some of the new members of the board will be ex officio members. The board will also use a weighted voting process during meetings. The agreement also discussed when leadership roles on the board would be elected.</p>\n\n<p>\"The main reason the 28E agreement is being amended is because of the children's behavioral health bill that was passed in <chron>May 2019</chron>,\" Elam said. \"The regions, starting <chron>Jan. 1</chron>, will be providing access or information and referral and ensuring services are available to children with a diagnosis of serious emotional disorders.\"</p>\n\n<p>Elam said a policy was also being written regarding internal disputes that would be added to the agreement later. Last year <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.musine\">Muscatine County</location> had voted to leave the region, only to be denied admittance by the South East Iowa Link region. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1217855052\">Iowa Department of Human Services</org> (DHS) had assigned <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.musine\">Muscatine County</location> back to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Eastern Iowa</location> region after the governing board had denied re-admittance.</p>\n\n<p>Supervisor <person>Nathan Mather</person>, also an attorney, asked several questions regarding the new agreement. He asked for clarification on the section dealing with re-appointment of directors. Elam said the appointments were made by the advisory committees and that most of the changes to the agreement were being done as a result of DHS mandates.</p>\n\n<p>\"They are tying our hands once again,\" Elam said. \"Maybe this will change next year as we discuss legislation regarding the children's bill and all of the requirements that came with it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Mather also asked if the board was just a \"rubber stamp\" and had to approve any nomination made by the advisory committees. Elam responded \"it does appear so, yes.\"</p>\n\n<p>There were a few other clarifications Mather asked for, including how votes were taken. He commented with the weighted vote and the additional members, each vote taken by the governing board would have 18 votes. Elam said the questions would be brought up to the governing board.</p>\n\n<p>Elam asked supervisor chair <person>Jeff Sorensen</person> to contact governing board chair <person>Ken Beck</person> regarding the concerns of the agreement. Sorensen said he would contact Beck that afternoon and that the supervisors would vote on the agreement during its <chron>June 15</chron> meeting.</p>",
