    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Sports\nResearch Daily \\-- From Alexandria, Virginia, NewsRx journalists report that a\npatent by the inventor Von Koenigsegg, Christian (Vejbystrand, SE), filed on\nJanuary 11, 2019, was published online on June 8, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee for patent number 10,662,687 is Koenigsegg Automotive AB\n(Angelholm, Sweden).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Road vehicles come in various forms and sizes.\nAlthough the general character is that of a body and four wheels, features\nsuch as length, height and width together with such details as the type and\nplacement of doors vary to a large extent among the road vehicles. For\nexample, road vehicles that may be designated as station wagons or sport\nutility vehicles (SUV) are relatively large and are of significant height in\norder to accommodate a plurality of passengers and bulky items such as\nbaggage. The typical configuration of such road vehicles is also such that the\nside doors are arranged at a height above the ground upon which the vehicle is\nparked that they can swing out without risk of hitting a curb when the road\nvehicle is parked along a street that is lined by a curb or similar lining.\n\n\"On the other hand, a typical sports car is, in contrast to a station wagon or\nSUV, a low riding vehicle having a high power engine. A sport car is also,\nneedless to say, typically very expensive both in terms of initial cost of\npurchase but also expensive in terms of service and, in particular, cost of\nrepairing a damaged part of the car. Hence, the particular fact that a sports\ncar is low riding has a direct impact on the risk of a side door being damaged\nby hitting a curb when the door is opened and swings out, with the subsequent\nexpensive repairs.\n\n\"The risk of damaging a passenger door of a sports car has been recognized,\nsince long and various attempts have been made in order to reduce such a risk.\nOne example of such attempts is that some sports cars have been configured\nwith side doors that, during a procedure of opening the door, the door swings\nout from the body of the car a very limited distance before rotating around an\naxis that is essentially perpendicular to the plane of the door. Such a door\nis connected to the body of the vehicle by means of a single door hinge that\nallows transverse movement in combination with rotational movement of the\ndoor, that provide a reduced risk of damaging the door by hitting a curb by\nthe side of which the vehicle is parked. However, sports car development is\nsuch that there is an ever increasing desire to provide vehicles having low\nprofiles, and as a consequence, having side doors with lowermost parts that\nare placed at extremely short distances from the ground. Consequently, there\nis a continued need to provide arrangements that allow doors, in particular\nside doors, of road vehicles to open without being damaged as a result of\nhitting a curb.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx\ncorrespondents also obtained the inventor's summary information for this\npatent: \"In view of the above, an object of the present disclosure is to\novercome or at least mitigate at least some of the drawbacks related to doors\nof road vehicles.\n\n\"This is achieved in a first aspect by a door hinge for connecting a side door\nof a road vehicle to the body of the road vehicle. The door hinge has a closed\nstate in which the side door is closed and an open state in which the side\ndoor is open. The door hinge comprises a door mount for connecting the door\nhinge to the side door, and a base or frame for mounting the door hinge to the\nbody of the road vehicle in a mounting orientation. A coupler is connected the\ndoor mount, and a crank is pivotally connected to the base by a first joint\nand to the coupler by a second joint. A follower is pivotally connected to the\nbase by a third joint and to the coupler by a fourth joint.\n\n\"The base, coupler, crank, and follower are arranged to shift the door mount,\nor the side door, in outward movement relative to the base in its mounting\norientation, or relative to the body of the road vehicle, at a change of the\nstate of the door hinge from closed to open. The coupler is connected to the\ndoor mount by a fifth joint, wherein the fifth joint is a revolute joint\narranged to allow a rotation of the door mount relative to the coupler that is\ntransverse to the outward movement. A gear mechanism connects the door mount\nand the crank and is arranged to rotate the door mount relative to the coupler\nat a change of the state of the door hinge from closed to open.\n\n\"In terms of weight carrying capacity, embodiments of the door hinge include\nthose where it is configured to carry a side door having a weight in the range\n10 kg to 100 kg.\n\n\"The first joint may be a revolute joint that is arranged or oriented to shift\nthe door mount or the side door in upward movement relative to the base in its\nmounting orientation, or to the body of the road vehicle, when going from the\nclosed state to the open state.\n\n\"The first joint may be a revolute joint defining a first axis of rotation\nthat is tilted away from the door mount with the door hinge in its open state\nand the base in its mounting orientation.\n\n\"In other words, in various aspects, such a door hinge provides a technical\neffect that the side door of the road vehicle, when it is being opened, is\nshifted upwards while at the same time it shifts in an outward direction and\nrotates in a plane that is transverse to the outward direction. An advantage\nof such a technical effect is a decreased risk of the lowermost parts of the\nside door hitting, e.g., a roadside curb and, consequently, expensive\nrepairing of damages to the road vehicle can be avoided.\n\n\"In some embodiments, the base, coupler, crank, and follower are further\narranged to cause an angular change between the coupler and the crank at a\nchange of the state of the door hinge from closed to open. In such\nembodiments, the gear mechanism comprises a plurality of first cogs attached\nto the door mount and a plurality of second cogs attached to the crank. The\nfirst cogs and the second cogs are arranged to cooperate and rotate the door\nmount relative to the coupler at the angular change between the coupler and\nthe crank.\n\n\"In other words, such embodiments provide a simple and compact arrangement\nthat provides the rotation of the side door when it is being opened.\n\n\"In some embodiments, the second joint is a revolute joint defining a second\naxis of rotation that is tilted away from the base with the door hinge in its\nclosed state and the base in its mounting orientation.\n\n\"That is, such a tilted second axis of rotation has an effect of maintaining\nthe side door in a substantially vertical plane when it is being opened and,\nnaturally, maintaining the verticality also while the side door remains open.\nAn advantage of such an effect is that it minimizes the load on the door hinge\nitself and the load on the body of the vehicle because of the center of\ngravity of the side door is aligned with the hinge.\n\n\"A mechanical linkage of the base, coupler, crank, and follower may, in some\nembodiments, define a double-rocker motion at a change of the state of the\ndoor hinge from closed to open. Such a mechanical linkage may be obtained by\nthe first and third joints being spaced apart on the base, and the second and\nfourth joints being spaced apart on the coupler. For example, the separation\nbetween the centers of the first and third joints may be greater than the\nseparation between the centers of the second and fourth joints, and the\nseparation between the centers of the first and second joints may be greater\nthan the separation between the centers of the third and fourth joints.\n\n\"An advantage of such mechanical linkage is that it is a simple and compact\nconstruction.\n\n\"The door hinge may comprise a damper, and, in some embodiments, it may\ncomprise an actuator. The damper, e.g. a linear damper, may be connected by a\nsixth joint to the base and a seventh joint to the crank and arranged to\ndampen relative movement between the base and the crank at a change of the\nstate of the door hinge from open to closed. The actuator may be connected by\nan eighth joint to the base and a ninth joint to the crank and configured to\nchange the state of the door hinge from closed to open.\n\n\"An advantage of such embodiments is that they are simple and compact\nconstructions that enable easy and safe opening and closing of the side door.\n\n\"In a second aspect, the above object is also achieved by a road vehicle\ncomprising a body, a side door, and a door hinge according to the first\naspect, wherein the door hinge connects the side door of the road vehicle to\nthe body of the road vehicle.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"The invention claimed is:\n\n\"1\\.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Sports Research Daily</org> -- From <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.alxdra\">Alexandria, Virginia</location>, NewsRx journalists report that a patent by the inventor Von Koenigsegg, Christian (Vejbystrand, SE), filed on <chron>January 11, 2019</chron>, was published online on <chron>June 8, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The patent&#8217;s assignee for patent number 10,662,687 is <org>Koenigsegg Automotive AB</org> (Angelholm, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/se\">Sweden</location>).</p>\n<p>News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;Road vehicles come in various forms and sizes. Although the general character is that of a body and four wheels, features such as length, height and width together with such details as the type and placement of doors vary to a large extent among the road vehicles. For example, road vehicles that may be designated as station wagons or sport utility vehicles (SUV) are relatively large and are of significant height in order to accommodate a plurality of passengers and bulky items such as baggage. The typical configuration of such road vehicles is also such that the side doors are arranged at a height above the ground upon which the vehicle is parked that they can swing out without risk of hitting a curb when the road vehicle is parked along a street that is lined by a curb or similar lining.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand, a typical sports car is, in contrast to a station wagon or SUV, a low riding vehicle having a high power engine. A sport car is also, needless to say, typically very expensive both in terms of initial cost of purchase but also expensive in terms of service and, in particular, cost of repairing a damaged part of the car. Hence, the particular fact that a sports car is low riding has a direct impact on the risk of a side door being damaged by hitting a curb when the door is opened and swings out, with the subsequent expensive repairs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The risk of damaging a passenger door of a sports car has been recognized, since long and various attempts have been made in order to reduce such a risk. One example of such attempts is that some sports cars have been configured with side doors that, during a procedure of opening the door, the door swings out from the body of the car a very limited distance before rotating around an axis that is essentially perpendicular to the plane of the door. Such a door is connected to the body of the vehicle by means of a single door hinge that allows transverse movement in combination with rotational movement of the door, that provide a reduced risk of damaging the door by hitting a curb by the side of which the vehicle is parked. However, sports car development is such that there is an ever increasing desire to provide vehicles having low profiles, and as a consequence, having side doors with lowermost parts that are placed at extremely short distances from the ground. Consequently, there is a continued need to provide arrangements that allow doors, in particular side doors, of road vehicles to open without being damaged as a result of hitting a curb.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent: &#8220;In view of the above, an object of the present disclosure is to overcome or at least mitigate at least some of the drawbacks related to doors of road vehicles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is achieved in a first aspect by a door hinge for connecting a side door of a road vehicle to the body of the road vehicle. The door hinge has a closed state in which the side door is closed and an open state in which the side door is open. The door hinge comprises a door mount for connecting the door hinge to the side door, and a base or frame for mounting the door hinge to the body of the road vehicle in a mounting orientation. A coupler is connected the door mount, and a crank is pivotally connected to the base by a first joint and to the coupler by a second joint. A follower is pivotally connected to the base by a third joint and to the coupler by a fourth joint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The base, coupler, crank, and follower are arranged to shift the door mount, or the side door, in outward movement relative to the base in its mounting orientation, or relative to the body of the road vehicle, at a change of the state of the door hinge from closed to open. The coupler is connected to the door mount by a fifth joint, wherein the fifth joint is a revolute joint arranged to allow a rotation of the door mount relative to the coupler that is transverse to the outward movement. A gear mechanism connects the door mount and the crank and is arranged to rotate the door mount relative to the coupler at a change of the state of the door hinge from closed to open.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of weight carrying capacity, embodiments of the door hinge include those where it is configured to carry a side door having a weight in the range 10 kg to 100 kg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first joint may be a revolute joint that is arranged or oriented to shift the door mount or the side door in upward movement relative to the base in its mounting orientation, or to the body of the road vehicle, when going from the closed state to the open state.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first joint may be a revolute joint defining a first axis of rotation that is tilted away from the door mount with the door hinge in its open state and the base in its mounting orientation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In other words, in various aspects, such a door hinge provides a technical effect that the side door of the road vehicle, when it is being opened, is shifted upwards while at the same time it shifts in an outward direction and rotates in a plane that is transverse to the outward direction. An advantage of such a technical effect is a decreased risk of the lowermost parts of the side door hitting, e.g., a roadside curb and, consequently, expensive repairing of damages to the road vehicle can be avoided.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some embodiments, the base, coupler, crank, and follower are further arranged to cause an angular change between the coupler and the crank at a change of the state of the door hinge from closed to open. In such embodiments, the gear mechanism comprises a plurality of first cogs attached to the door mount and a plurality of second cogs attached to the crank. The first cogs and the second cogs are arranged to cooperate and rotate the door mount relative to the coupler at the angular change between the coupler and the crank.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In other words, such embodiments provide a simple and compact arrangement that provides the rotation of the side door when it is being opened.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some embodiments, the second joint is a revolute joint defining a second axis of rotation that is tilted away from the base with the door hinge in its closed state and the base in its mounting orientation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That is, such a tilted second axis of rotation has an effect of maintaining the side door in a substantially vertical plane when it is being opened and, naturally, maintaining the verticality also while the side door remains open. An advantage of such an effect is that it minimizes the load on the door hinge itself and the load on the body of the vehicle because of the center of gravity of the side door is aligned with the hinge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A mechanical linkage of the base, coupler, crank, and follower may, in some embodiments, define a double-rocker motion at a change of the state of the door hinge from closed to open. Such a mechanical linkage may be obtained by the first and third joints being spaced apart on the base, and the second and fourth joints being spaced apart on the coupler. For example, the separation between the centers of the first and third joints may be greater than the separation between the centers of the second and fourth joints, and the separation between the centers of the first and second joints may be greater than the separation between the centers of the third and fourth joints.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An advantage of such mechanical linkage is that it is a simple and compact construction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The door hinge may comprise a damper, and, in some embodiments, it may comprise an actuator. The damper, e.g. a linear damper, may be connected by a sixth joint to the base and a seventh joint to the crank and arranged to dampen relative movement between the base and the crank at a change of the state of the door hinge from open to closed. The actuator may be connected by an eighth joint to the base and a ninth joint to the crank and configured to change the state of the door hinge from closed to open.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An advantage of such embodiments is that they are simple and compact constructions that enable easy and safe opening and closing of the side door.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a second aspect, the above object is also achieved by a road vehicle comprising a body, a side door, and a door hinge according to the first aspect, wherein the door hinge connects the side door of the road vehicle to the body of the road vehicle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;The invention claimed is:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
