    "text": "KATE GARRAWAY wept today as she talked about her critically ill husband and\nsaid she does not know if he will recover from coronavirus.\n\nThe Good Morning Britain presenter, 53, said Derek Draper, to whom she has\nbeen married for 14 years, was \"still here and holding on\" after 10 weeks in\nhospital.\n\nShe confirmed the former political lobbyist, who is in an induced coma, is now\n\"Covid-free\" but said the virus had caused \"extraordinary damage\" to his body.\nShe said doctors were uncertain if he'd ever make a full recovery. Speaking\nthis morning to the ITV show, she said: \"He's still with us, he has fought the\nmost extraordinary battle, the fact that he's still here and holding on. It\nhas affected him from the top of his head to the toes.\"\n\nShe added: \"He has tested negative, the fight with the virus is over, but it's\nwreaked extraordinary damage on his body and we don't know if he can recover\nfrom that.\"\n\nGarraway, who has two children with Draper, daughter Darcey, 14, and son\nBilly, 10, continued: \"The fact that he is still here, I am so grateful ...\nthere seems to be a flicker of hope.\"\n\nThe presenter described how her husband was \"begging\" to be put in an induced\ncoma when he first went in to hospital because he felt like he was\n\"suffocating\". She said when they last spoke, \"he said: 'I love you, I'm sorry\nI have to leave you, you've saved my life.' I think he thought I had asked the\ndoctors to put him in a coma. He said: 'Being married to you, the children,\nyou saved my life.'\"",

    "html": "<p><person>KATE GARRAWAY</person> wept today as she talked about her critically ill husband and said she does not know if he will recover from coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The Good Morning Britain presenter, 53, said <person>Derek Draper</person>, to whom she has been married for 14 years, was \"still here and holding on\" after 10 weeks in hospital.</p>\n<p>She confirmed the former political lobbyist, who is in an induced coma, is now \"Covid-free\" but said the virus had caused \"extraordinary damage\" to his body. She said doctors were uncertain if he'd ever make a full recovery. Speaking this morning to the ITV show, she said: \"He's still with us, he has fought the most extraordinary battle, the fact that he's still here and holding on. It has affected him from the top of his head to the toes.\"</p>\n<p>She added: \"He has tested negative, the fight with the virus is over, but it's wreaked extraordinary damage on his body and we don't know if he can recover from that.\"</p>\n<p>Garraway, who has two children with Draper, daughter Darcey, 14, and son Billy, 10, continued: \"The fact that he is still here, I am so grateful ... there seems to be a flicker of hope.\"</p>\n<p>The presenter described how her husband was \"begging\" to be put in an induced coma when he first went in to hospital because he felt like he was \"suffocating\". She said when they last spoke, \"he said: 'I love you, I'm sorry I have to leave you, you've saved my life.' I think he thought I had asked the doctors to put him in a coma. He said: 'Being married to you, the children, you saved my life.'\"</p>",
