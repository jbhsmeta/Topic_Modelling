This included countless projects, experiments, labs,\ngames, and other activities. The one class that sticks out as being the most\nmemorable is probably my sophomore year biology class. I was already invested\nin the subject matter before the class even started due to my interest in\nbiology in regards to the medical field. As we all know biology can be a hard\nconcept to grasp due to its extensive involvement in life in general. The most\nmemorable activity in this class was when we got to dissect in the lab. How\nliving these are able to survive is a lot easier to understand when you see\nthem right in front of you rather than a diagram. Biology was probably one of\nthe hardest classes in my high school career, but also my most valuable.\n\nThe Arts\n\nAlexis Bueno, child of Buddy and Stacy Bueno, plans to major in Nursing at\nAurora University, Aurora, Ill.\n\nTop 3 accomplishments: National Choral Award, National Honors Society, and 1\nSuperior Rating at Solo Contest.\n\nWhat's something you learned that you will take with you after high school? I\nwill always remember the fun that was brought into learning during both band\nand choir. My director always made it fun and made sure that there was fun\ninvolved in learning and participating in class. He always had fun stories to\ntell us and life lessons to reach us.\n\nHumanities\n\nShelby Hodge, child of Steve and Melinda Hodge, plans to major in Elementary\nEducation at Kirkwood Community College.\n\nTop 3 achievements: 3.75 GPA Academic Excellence Award, National Honor Society\nMember, and Perfect Attendance\n\nWhat's something you learned that you will take with you after high school?\nThere have been many classroom learning experiences that have been impacting\nand memorable. One that especially comes to mind was in my Honors English\nclass sophomore year. That year we started to read The Tempest by William\nShakespeare.\n\nThe Tempest was a new and different type of literature for our class. So, my\nteacher had us act out the parts of the play. At first, our class was timid\nabout this new learning experience, but that quickly changed. Each student had\na character or would switch after so many lines. I especially remember playing\nthe part of Caliban and Trinculo.\n\nOn top of acting it out, we made character charts, answered questions, and\nlearned vocab. All of these ways helped my class understand The Tempest.\nHowever, I believe acting it out impacted me the most. I'm very thankful for\nmy English teacher for this memorable classroom experience.\n\nLeadership\n\nAdelie Mure-Ravaud, child of Julie and Philippe Mure-Ravaud, plans to major in\nPre-health professional at Clinton Community College.\n\nTop 3 achievements: Overall Steamer of the Month, 4-year Academic Excellence,\nand International Thespian\n\nWhat's something you learned that you will take with you after high school?\nOne of my most memorable classroom experiences was making Hamlet themed\nTikToks in my AP literature class. Our teacher gave us the opportunity to work\nwith our friends and use our creativity in the classroom. It allowed us to\ncombine our classwork with our out-of-school entertainment. The best part was\nwatching everyone's Hamlet version of popular TikToks.\n\nMath/The Sciences\n\nSara Norman, child of Keith and Vicki Norman, plans to major in Architectural\nEngineering at Olivet Nazarene University, Bourbonnais, Ill.\n\nTop 3 achievements: Illinois State Scholar, President of Student Council, and\nPresident of National Honor Society.\n\nWhat's something you learned that you will take with you after high school? I\ndecided to take a physics class during my junior year of high school. I\nremembered hearing about all of the fun projects that were involved, and the\nSix Flags trip at the end of the year was definitely a motivator for me to\njoin the class. However, I learned very quickly that designing and engineering\nthings were my dream. My most memorable learning experience was when we were\ngiven the assignment to create a hoverboard. Racing across a gym while sitting\non a piece of floating wood and holding a leaf blower definitely tops any\nother experience I had in school. Not only was it educational, but it was also\na fun competition. I will remember that physics class forever and am excited\nto continue my education by doing something I love: creating and building new\nthings.\n\nVocational Education\n\nKatie Grant, child of Sherrie and Chris Grant, will be enlisting in the U.S.\nArmy.\n\nTop 3 achievements: Being asked to volunteer to paint murals at the elementary\nschool in Fulton, Student of the Month for Band, and being chosen for the end\nof the year Art Award.\n\nWhat's something you learned that you will take with you after high school? My\nfavorite classroom learning experience is when we study for our history tests\nplaying a game like Jeopardy. It is a fun way to remember and study for your\ntest. You have to work as a team but you also need to know what you are doing\nindependently. I will remember this forever because there are moments when\nyour body is moving faster than your brain and you have no answer yet but you\nbuzzed in to answer anyway. Or when you have the answer on the tip of your\ntongue but it just won't come out. The final jeopardy can make you win or lose\nit all depending on if you are correct. I will always smile and laugh when I\nremember the game.",

Throughout my high school experience, I have been subject to many activities to further my education. This included countless projects, experiments, labs, games, and other activities. The one class that sticks out as being the most memorable is probably my sophomore year biology class. I was already invested in the subject matter before the class even started due to my interest in biology in regards to the medical field. As we all know biology can be a hard concept to grasp due to its extensive involvement in life in general. The most memorable activity in this class was when we got to dissect in the lab. How living these are able to survive is a lot easier to understand when you see them right in front of you rather than a diagram. Biology was probably one of the hardest classes in my high school career, but also my most valuable.</p>\n\n<p>The Arts</p>\n\n<p><person>Alexis Bueno</person>, child of Buddy and <person>Stacy Bueno</person>, plans to major in Nursing at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0733629567\">Aurora University</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.aurora\">Aurora, Ill.</location></p>\n\n<p>Top 3 accomplishments: National Choral Award, <org>National Honors Society</org>, and 1 Superior Rating at Solo Contest.</p>\n\n<p>What's something you learned that you will take with you after high school?

There have been many classroom learning experiences that have been impacting and memorable. One that especially comes to mind was in my Honors English class sophomore year. That year we started to read The Tempest by <person>William Shakespeare</person>.</p>\n\n<p>The Tempest was a new and different type of literature for our class. So, my teacher had us act out the parts of the play. At first, our class was timid about this new learning experience, but that quickly changed. Each student had a character or would switch after so many lines. I especially remember playing the part of Caliban and Trinculo.</p>\n\n<p>On top of acting it out, we made character charts, answered questions, and learned vocab. All of these ways helped my class understand The Tempest. However, I believe acting it out impacted me the most. I'm very thankful for my English teacher for this memorable classroom experience.</p>\n\n<p>Leadership</p>\n\n<p>Adelie Mure-Ravaud, child of Julie and <person>Philippe Mure-Ravaud</person>, plans to major in Pre-health professional at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1730626143\">Clinton Community College</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Top 3 achievements: Overall Steamer of the Month, 4-year Academic Excellence, and International Thespian</p>\n\n<p>What's something you learned that you will take with you after high school? One of my most memorable classroom experiences was making Hamlet themed TikToks in my AP literature class. Our teacher gave us the opportunity to work with our friends and use our creativity in the classroom. It allowed us to combine our classwork with our out-of-school entertainment. The best part was watching everyone's Hamlet version of popular TikToks.</p>\n\n<p>Math/The Sciences</p>\n\n<p><person>Sara Norman</person>, child of Keith and <person>Vicki Norman</person>, plans to major in Architectural Engineering at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2334972469\">Olivet Nazarene University</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.bouais\">Bourbonnais, Ill.</location></p>\n\n<p>Top 3 achievements: Illinois State Scholar, President of <org>Student Council</org>, and President of <org>National Honor Society</org>.</p>\n\n<p>What's something you learned that you will take with you after high school? I decided to take a physics class during my junior year of high school. I remembered hearing about all of the fun projects that were involved, and the Six Flags trip at the end of the year was definitely a motivator for me to join the class. However, I learned very quickly that designing and engineering things were my dream. My most memorable learning experience was when we were given the assignment to create a hoverboard. Racing across a gym while sitting on a piece of floating wood and holding a leaf blower definitely tops any other experience I had in school. Not only was it educational, but it was also a fun competition. I will remember that physics class forever and am excited to continue my education by doing something I love: creating and building new things.</p>\n\n<p>Vocational Education</p>\n\n<p><person>Katie Grant</person>, child of Sherrie and <person>Chris Grant</person>, will be enlisting in the <org>U.S. Army</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Top 3 achievements: Being asked to volunteer to paint murals at the elementary school in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.fulton\">Fulton</location>, Student of the Month for Band, and being chosen for the end of the year Art Award.</p>\n\n<p>What's something you learned that you will take with you after high school? My favorite classroom learning experience is when we study for our history tests playing a game like Jeopardy. It is a fun way to remember and study for your test. You have to work as a team but you also need to know what you are doing independently. I will remember this forever because there are moments when your body is moving faster than your brain and you have no answer yet but you buzzed in to answer anyway. Or when you have the answer on the tip of your tongue but it just won't come out. The final jeopardy can make you win or lose it all depending on if you are correct. I will always smile and laugh when I remember the game.</p>",
