He's been at every graduation from Pre-K\nto today.\n\n\"That's my baby, I got to support,\" said Kenny Edwards, father.\n\nThere is a more official graduation scheduled for next month. But a lung\ncancer diagnosis means Edwards will most likely not live to see it. Which\nprompted this special ceremony.\n\n\"He means everything. I call him my heart. I call him my world. He's truly,\ntruly, my everything to me,\" said Kenyette Edwards.\n\nAs Kenyette turns to a new chapter -- her dad has a message for what's next.\n\n\"Stay positive, if it's negative, stay away from it and keep on pushing.\nThere's still a long ways to go,\" said Kenny Edwards.\n\nKenyette hopes to study to become a nurse.\n\n43.178897 -88.117313",
