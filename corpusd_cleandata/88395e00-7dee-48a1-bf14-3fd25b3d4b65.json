Ron DeSantis and the Florida\nDepartment of Business and Professional Regulation \"for their leadership and\nquick response to our request to reopen our vacation rentals in a safe and\nresponsible manner.\"\n\nIndian River County's plan to reopen vacation rentals was approved Saturday.\nThe regulations set by that county include no more than 10 guests allowed and\na 24-hour period between guests to ensure enough time for proper cleaning.\n\nMax Chesnes is a TCPalm breaking news reporter.
