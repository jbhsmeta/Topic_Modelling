    "text": "Every Memorial Day, my longtime friend David would honor both his family and\nfellow Vietnam War veterans with a visit to his hometown cemetery, an hour's\ndrive west of St. Louis.\n\nWith the help of siblings and cousins, David would mow the grass in the family\nplot, scrub its granite and brass grave markers, and place colorful, fist-\nsized peonies on the graves of those he knew and those he didn't. Whether he\nwas living in Miami or Tokyo, David tried to spend every Memorial Day doing\nwhat he believed was his duty: remembering the dead and what they had\nsacrificed so he could stand that day, sweaty but free, in their collective,\nremembered presence.\n\nDavid had sacrificed to be there, also. Two tours of duty in Vietnam as an\naircraft carrier-based medic meant that he and his crew mates were always in\ndanger whenever they helicoptered to rescue downed pilots on land or sea. The\nhigh-risk escapades also gave him a saucy, lifelong swagger.\n\nThe war and its divisive effects on the U.S. never left him. In fact, he left\nthe U.S. and lived in Japan for nearly 20 years because of it. Japan brought\nhim peace, a family and a career as an international trade consultant. The\nmost lucrative, far-reaching American contacts he made were in the-then\nexploding U.S.-Asia grain trade. Investment money and U.S. ag exports were\nflooding Japan and South Korea and were about to get a toehold in China, and\nDavid was smack in the middle of it all.\n\nHe returned to America in the late 1980s when the grain giants expanded into\nethanol, fructose, and several never-heard-of-before biotech processes to\n\"engineer\" new items like lysine, a livestock feed supplement, and citric\nacid, a food additive.\n\nThen, in 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it was investigating\nArcher Daniels Midland for allegedly fixing prices in some of its markets.\nEven more incredible, the DOJ confirmed that its evidence included video and\naudio tapes made by an ADM insider, an executive named Mark Whitacre.\n\nWhitacre had two weaknesses no corporate mole should possess: He couldn't stop\ntalking and his best friend in the grain trade was David. Whatever Whitacre\nknew or learned, David soon would know or learn.\n\nAnd, soon thereafter, David's contacts at the New York Times, Washington Post,\nChicago Tribune and other outlets would know.\n\nThe ADM story, however, was a saga of power and corruption that claimed the\ncareers of both ADM executives who lived it and journalists who covered it\nbecause the truth was often hidden in a haystack of lies.\n\nOne of its biggest victims was David. He felt that the Justice Department had\nintentionally botched an even bigger case against ADM because of the company's\npolitical connections, and he sank into a sea of bitterness and paranoia. The\nlast time my family visited him before his 2015 death, I spotted a sawed-off,\n12-gauge shotgun painted to match the living room wall it was leaning against\nmaking it - in plain sight - all but invisible.\n\nWhy? I asked.\n\n\"Because,\" he said, \"you never know.\"\n\nMaybe not, but I do know that when his fear and anger at individuals replaced\nhis love and duty for his nation, this honorable lion became a gun-hiding\nmouse. It was a tragic unwinding; one that no one would wish on anyone or any\nfriend. Or any nation.\n\nMore information: [www.farmandfoodfile.com](http://www.farmandfoodfile.com).",

Whether he was living in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.miami\">Miami</location> or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/jp..tokyo\">Tokyo</location>, David tried to spend every <chron>Memorial Day</chron> doing what he believed was his duty: remembering the dead and what they had sacrificed so he could stand that day, sweaty but free, in their collective, remembered presence.</p>\n<p>David had sacrificed to be there, also. Two tours of duty in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/vn\">Vietnam</location> as an aircraft carrier-based medic meant that he and his crew mates were always in danger whenever they helicoptered to rescue downed pilots on land or sea. The high-risk escapades also gave him a saucy, lifelong swagger.</p>\n<p>The war and its divisive effects on the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> never left him. In fact, he left the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and lived in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> for nearly 20 years because of it. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> brought him peace, a family and a career as an international trade consultant. The most lucrative, far-reaching American contacts he made were in the-then exploding <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</location> grain trade. Investment money and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> ag exports were flooding <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location> and were about to get a toehold in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, and David was smack in the middle of it all.</p>\n<p>He returned to America in the late 1980s when the grain giants expanded into ethanol, fructose, and several never-heard-of-before biotech processes to \"engineer\" new items like lysine, a livestock feed supplement, and citric acid, a food additive.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1993, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0746094848\">U.S. Department of Justice</org> announced it was investigating <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:ADM\">Archer Daniels Midland</org> for allegedly fixing prices in some of its markets. Even more incredible, the DOJ confirmed that its evidence included video and audio tapes made by an ADM insider, an executive named <person>Mark Whitacre</person>.</p>\n<p>Whitacre had two weaknesses no corporate mole should possess: He couldn't stop talking and his best friend in the grain trade was David. Whatever Whitacre knew or learned, David soon would know or learn.</p>\n<p>And, soon thereafter, David's contacts at the New York Times, <org>Washington Post</org>, <org>Chicago Tribune</org> and other outlets would know.</p>\n<p>The ADM story, however, was a saga of power and corruption that claimed the careers of both ADM executives who lived it and journalists who covered it because the truth was often hidden in a haystack of lies.</p>\n<p>One of its biggest victims was David. He felt that the <org>Justice Department</org> had intentionally botched an even bigger case against ADM because of the company's political connections, and he sank into a sea of bitterness and paranoia. The last time my family visited him before his 2015 death, I spotted a sawed-off, 12-gauge shotgun painted to match the living room wall it was leaning against making it - in plain sight - all but invisible.</p>\n<p>Why? I asked.</p>\n<p>\"Because,\" he said, \"you never know.\"</p>\n<p>Maybe not, but I do know that when his fear and anger at individuals replaced his love and duty for his nation, this honorable lion became a gun-hiding mouse. It was a tragic unwinding; one that no one would wish on anyone or any friend. Or any nation.</p>\n<p>More information: <a href=\"http://www.farmandfoodfile.com\">www.farmandfoodfile.com</a>.</p>",
