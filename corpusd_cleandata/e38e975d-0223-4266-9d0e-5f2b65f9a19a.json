The cleanest city of the country, which\nis among 10 worst-hit districts due to Covid-19 in the country, on Thursday\npenalised people found to be violating social distancing norm and not wearing\nmasks while being at public places. This is perhaps first time in the country,\nany city imposed fine for violating Covid-19 guidelines.\n\nAs many as 28 people were slapped spot fine for not adhering to social\ndistancing norms and 29 for not wearing mask while being at public places.\nBesides, one person was fined for doing construction work and four for opening\nshops and other institutions without obtaining permission.\n\nMunicipal commissioner Pratibha Patil said, \"The crackdown has just begun. We\nare going to intensify the drive in days to come.\"\n\nThe district administration eased lockdown restrictions from June 1 but made\nmandatory for residents to follow social distancing norms while being in\npublic places. It has roped Indore Municipal Corporation into the task of\npenalizing people found to be violating the norms.\n\nActing on the directives, IMC slapped spot fine ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 1100\nfor not wearing masks or not following social distancing.\n\nFines were also slapped on the shopkeepers who were not ensuring social\ndistancing outside their shops.",
