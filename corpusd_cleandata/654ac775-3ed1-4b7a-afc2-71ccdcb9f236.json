    "text": "World-class fishing continues to exceed expectations on Lake Erie in 2020,\naccording to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife.\nWalleye harvest rates set records for the second straight year in 2019, and\nnumerous large hatches point to an increasingly bright future for the Walleye\nCapital of the World.\n\nThe top Lake Erie walleye catch rates from 2019 were in June, July and May,\nrespectively, according to surveys conducted by the Division of Wildlife, so\nthe best fishing this year is yet to come. An estimated 116 million walleye 2\nyears old and older are found in Lake Erie. Many of these 2-year old walleye\nwill reach the 15-inch minimum size length necessary to be included in the\ndaily bag limit during the summer.\n\n\"Lake Erie offers some of the best fishing opportunities in the nation,\" said\nDivision of Wildlife Chief Kendra Wecker. \"The outlook has never been brighter\nfor Lake Erie walleye fishing, with a strong future that has been built by\nconsistently successful hatches since 2014 and solid science-based\nmanagement.\"\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, fishing is a pursuit that can be enjoyed while\nsafely practicing social distancing. The Ohio Department of Health's COVID-19\nsafety rules and guidelines for fishing can be found at\n[coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/responsible/fishing.pdf](http://coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/responsible/fishing.pdf).\nFor more information on COVID-19 and the Ohio Department of Health's\nrecommendations on prevention and preparation, visit\n[coronavirus.ohio.gov](http://coronavirus.ohio.gov).\n\nThe walleye bag limit on Lake Erie is six fish per angler with a 15-inch\nminimum size length. Lake Erie walleye and yellow perch fisheries are managed\nthrough an interagency quota system. Each jurisdiction regulates its catches\nto comply with annually determined safe harvest levels that ensure\nsustainability.\n\nWalleye\n\nWalleye anglers will mostly catch abundant 3-, 5- and 6-year-old fish that\nshould average 20 inches and could be as large as 26 inches. Abundant young\nfish from the 2018 and 2019 hatches will show up in the catch and range from 9\nto 14 inches, with an increasing number of 2-year-olds reaching 15 inches as\nthe season progresses. Anglers are encouraged to release these sub-legal fish\nwith as little handling as possible so they can contribute to the future\nfishery.\n\nAdditional opportunities\n\nSmallmouth bass and largemouth bass fishing in 2020 should provide good\nfishing and trophy catches. Anglers may harvest one bass per day, with a\nminimum size limit of 18 inches from May 1 to June 26, 2020. The daily limit\nis five bass per day with a 14-inch minimum size limit from June 27, 2020, to\nApril 30, 2021.\n\nThe yellow perch daily bag limit is 30. Yellow perch fishing has been slower\nthan in previous years throughout the lake, and this pattern may continue. The\nwestern basin population is strong with an abundance of trophy-sized fish and\na promising future from an above-average 2018 hatch that is growing\nexceptionally fast. The central basin population density is less than that of\nthe western basin, but eastern Ohio's waters should yield above-average fish\nfrom the 2012 and 2014 hatches. Updated Lake Erie fishing reports are\navailable by calling 888-HOOKFISH (466-5347).\n\nJack Kiser is the host of \"Buckeye Angler\" and longtime outdoors columnist for\nthe Record-Courier and Midwest Outdoors magazine.

    "html": "<p>World-class fishing continues to exceed expectations on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> in 2020, according to the <org>Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife</org>. Walleye harvest rates set records for the second straight year in 2019, and numerous large hatches point to an increasingly bright future for the <org>Walleye Capital</org> of the World.</p>\n<p>The top <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> walleye catch rates from 2019 were in June, July and May, respectively, according to surveys conducted by the <org>Division of Wildlife</org>, so the best fishing this year is yet to come. An estimated 116 million walleye 2 years old and older are found in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location>. Many of these 2-year old walleye will reach the 15-inch minimum size length necessary to be included in the daily bag limit during the summer.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> offers some of the best fishing opportunities in the nation,\" said <org>Division of Wildlife Chief Kendra Wecker</org>. \"The outlook has never been brighter for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> walleye fishing, with a strong future that has been built by consistently successful hatches since 2014 and solid science-based management.\"</p>\n\n<p>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, fishing is a pursuit that can be enjoyed while safely practicing social distancing. <org>The Ohio Department of Health's</org> COVID-19 safety rules and guidelines for fishing can be found at <a href=\"http://coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/responsible/fishing.pdf\">coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/responsible/fishing.pdf</a>. For more information on COVID-19 and the <org>Ohio Department of Health's</org> recommendations on prevention and preparation, visit <a href=\"http://coronavirus.ohio.gov\">coronavirus.ohio.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The walleye bag limit on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> is six fish per angler with a 15-inch minimum size length. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> walleye and yellow perch fisheries are managed through an interagency quota system. Each jurisdiction regulates its catches to comply with annually determined safe harvest levels that ensure sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>Walleye</p>\n\n<p>Walleye anglers will mostly catch abundant 3-, 5- and 6-year-old fish that should average 20 inches and could be as large as 26 inches. Abundant young fish from the 2018 and 2019 hatches will show up in the catch and range from 9 to 14 inches, with an increasing number of 2-year-olds reaching 15 inches as the season progresses. Anglers are encouraged to release these sub-legal fish with as little handling as possible so they can contribute to the future fishery.</p>\n\n<p>Additional opportunities</p>\n\n<p>Smallmouth bass and largemouth bass fishing in 2020 should provide good fishing and trophy catches. Anglers may harvest one bass per day, with a minimum size limit of 18 inches from <chron>May 1 to June 26, 2020</chron>. The daily limit is five bass per day with a 14-inch minimum size limit from <chron>June 27, 2020</chron>, to <chron>April 30, 2021</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>The yellow perch daily bag limit is 30. Yellow perch fishing has been slower than in previous years throughout the lake, and this pattern may continue. The western basin population is strong with an abundance of trophy-sized fish and a promising future from an above-average 2018 hatch that is growing exceptionally fast. The central basin population density is less than that of the western basin, but eastern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio's</location> waters should yield above-average fish from the 2012 and 2014 hatches. Updated <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Erie</location> fishing reports are available by calling 888-HOOKFISH (466-5347).</p>\n\n<p><person>Jack Kiser</person> is the host of \"Buckeye Angler\" and longtime outdoors columnist for the <org>Record-Courier</org> and <org>Midwest Outdoors magazine</org>.
