    "text": "Editor's note: This article first appeared on [AMNY.com](http://AMNY.com)\n\nTuesday could provide a monumental moment in the arrival of Major League\nBaseball this summer.\n\nThe Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich reported that the league is\nexpected to offer an alternative compensation proposal to the player's union\nrather than the revenue-sharing plan that has created a prominent roadblock.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the owners approved MLB's plan for an early-July Opening Day to\nkick off an 82-game regular season that would see the players take an\nadditional pay cut based on revenue sharing.\n\nWith owners losing roughly 40% of their revenue with no fans in attendance,\nthe league's proposal would see the owners and players split the profits that\ncame in through television broadcasts and advertising.\n\nFor the players, it would be the equivalent of a salary cap during a season in\nwhich they already agreed to take a pay cut back in March when prorated\nsalaries were settled upon during baseball's hiatus.\n\nAn inability to agree on a salary structure will only postpone baseball's\nreturn, if not completely destroy it in 2020 - which makes Tuesday's\nalternative proposal so important.\n\nPer Rosenthal and Drellich, the player's union could choose between holding\nthe league to those prorated salaries agreed to two months ago or take a\nsemblance of a percentage-based pay cut to work with the owners.\n\nThose prorated salaries would provide a sizable hit on the wallets of all MLB\nteams.\n\nAccording to a report last week from the Associated Press, prorated salaries\ncould contribute to teams losing an average of $640,000 per game.\n\nThe Phillies are expected to lose $159 million, the 10th-most amongst MLB\nclubs - a ripple effect that could impact teams' spending during the\noffseason, especially in free agency.\n\nIt's something that could coax the players into agreeing to an additional\npercentage-based pay cut, which would avoid a stalemate that could wash the\n2020 season.\n\nThe post Tuesday's alternate salary meeting pivotal in MLB's 2020 start\nappeared first on Metro Philadelphia.",
