The article has also been updated to reflect the man has been\nidentified, according to police.*COLUMBUS, Ohio (WJW) - Columbus police were\nsearching for a person who was possibly involved in provoking violence during\nSaturday's protests.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the Ohio Statehouse and through downtown Columbus\nSaturday, demonstrating against police brutality after the death of 46-year-\nold George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody on Monday.\n\nAuthorities say that the majority of demonstrators remained peaceful, however,\nsome chose to act violently. Some individuals threw objects at police, break\nand vandalize city property, set fires to buildings and vehicles, and broke\ninto businesses.\n\n**See the video above for a look at the protest*According to the Columbus\nDivision of Police Facebook page, police were wanting to identify a man seen\nin a YouTube video.\n\nAccording to the post, social media users allege that the man photographed\nabove was \"paying people to riot and destroy public property\" during\nSaturday's event.\n\nThe Columbus Police Department updated the photo description Sunday morning\nsaying the man had been identified.\n\nTaylor Waters, an attorney who told NBC4 that she represents the man in the\nphoto, says the version of the photo and video shared by Columbus police was\nmisleading and from an unreliable source.\n\nThe photos and videos CPD previously shared regarding a person of interest\nwere inaccurate and reckless. CPD shared an edited video from an unreliable\nand heavily biased source. The poster removed the portion of the video which\nclearly demonstrates a request for supplies. My client was not inciting\nviolence, my client was seeking supplies to help people who had been injured\nby police officers. He did not pay anyone to cause property damage, break any\nlaw, or otherwise cause civil unrest. He is now the target of threats and\nfears for his and his family's safety. If CPD would like to discuss this\nfurther and view the whole video, they may contact me. I have already\nattempted to reach out.\n\nTAYLOR WATERS, WATERS LEGAL LLC\n\nColumbus police say 59 people were arrested after Saturday's protests and a\ncity-wide curfew has been enacted from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. It will remain in\neffect until Mayor Andrew Ginther chooses to rescind it.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine also activated the National Guard Saturday to assist\nColumbus police with the violence.\n\nAdditionally, all downtown streets are closed indefinitely and anyone who\nneeds to go downtown for work will be required to show ID. Anyone outside\nwithout authorization during the curfew window can be arrested.\n\nContinuing coverage, here.",

Some individuals threw objects at police, break and vandalize city property, set fires to buildings and vehicles, and broke into businesses.</p>\n\n<p>**See the video above for a look at the protest*According to the <org>Columbus Division of Police Facebook</org> page, police were wanting to identify a man seen in a YouTube video.</p>\n\n<p>According to the post, social media users allege that the man photographed above was \"paying people to riot and destroy public property\" during Saturday's event.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Columbus Police Department</org> updated the photo description Sunday morning saying the man had been identified.</p>\n\n<p><person>Taylor Waters</person>, an attorney who told NBC4 that she represents the man in the photo, says the version of the photo and video shared by Columbus police was misleading and from an unreliable source.</p>\n\n<p>The photos and videos CPD previously shared regarding a person of interest were inaccurate and reckless. CPD shared an edited video from an unreliable and heavily biased source. The poster removed the portion of the video which clearly demonstrates a request for supplies. My client was not inciting violence, my client was seeking supplies to help people who had been injured by police officers. He did not pay anyone to cause property damage, break any law, or otherwise cause civil unrest. He is now the target of threats and fears for his and his family's safety. If CPD would like to discuss this further and view the whole video, they may contact me. I have already attempted to reach out.</p>\n\n<p><person>TAYLOR WATERS</person>, <org>WATERS LEGAL LLC</org></p>\n\n<p>Columbus police say 59 people were arrested after Saturday's protests and a city-wide curfew has been enacted from <chron>10 p.m. until 6 a.m.</chron> It will remain in effect until Mayor <person>Andrew Ginther</person> chooses to rescind it.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> Governor <person>Mike DeWine</person> also activated the <org>National Guard</org>  Saturday to assist Columbus police with the violence.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, all downtown streets are closed indefinitely and anyone who needs to go downtown for work will be required to show ID. Anyone outside without authorization during the curfew window can be arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing coverage, here.</p>",
