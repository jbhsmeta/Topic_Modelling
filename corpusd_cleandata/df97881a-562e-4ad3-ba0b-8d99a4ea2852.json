    "text": "Former Jaguars safety Peyton Thompson spoke out on Twitter that the NFL and\nall of its organizations continue to release statements of fluff in the\naftermath of George Floyd's death.\n\nAnd Thompson, who played in Jacksonville from 2014-17, stated that former\nJaguars top executive Tom Coughlin and Coach Doug Marrone told players they\ncouldn't kneel during the playing of the national anthem in 2017.\n\n\"I specifically remember Tom Coughlin and Doug Marrone telling us we couldn't\nkneel,\" Thompson wrote. \"Thank God we had an owner [Shad Khan] of a minority\nwho weighed in and got us to kneel together. My job security was on the line\nif I supported my people.\"\n\nRELATED | See more Jacksonville Jaguars coverage\n\nWhen the Jaguars played the Baltimore Ravens in London in September 2017, at\nleast 15 players took a knee while owner Shad Khan and the rest of the team,\nincluding coaches and training staff, locked arms during the playing of the\nanthem.\n\nIt was a show of unity at the time to protest President Donald Trump's\ncontroversial remarks about firing NFL players that kneeled during the\nnational anthem that began in 2016 by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback\nColin Kaepernick's to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and\npolice brutality.\n\nThompson posted on Tuesday that he had a healthy conversation with Marrone\nMonday, stating that they spoke of his career's work on equality and his\nefforts to make his players feel supported as well as the need to separate his\nactions from others in the organization.\n\n''But, we also spoke of a time when the organization had a third party come in\nand speak to the team in an attempt to convince us to change our stance,''\nThompson wrote. ''The reality is - the environment that was created in our\nfacility wasn't safe for everyone to kneel peacefully in protest.\n\n''At least 60% of the team is of minority, including the owner, yet every\nplayer and coach across the league was scared to get 'Kaepernick'd, voices\nmuffled by fear.\n\nThompson stated the Jaguars now have the opportunity for a do-over, and he's\nhopeful Marrone's activism will lead the change for change this time around.\n\nThompson took exception to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's statement in the\nwake of Floyd's death, \"NFL family is greatly saddened by the tragic events\nacross our country and the protesters' reactions to these incidents reflect\nthe pain, anger, and frustration that so many of us feel.\"\n\nSeveral NFL players, including Eric Reed and Kenny Stills, along with\nThompson, criticized Goodell's statement as hypocrisy because of the way the\nleague handled Kaepernick's kneeling protests.\n\nA free agent, Kaepernick has remained unsigned since his final season with San\nFrancisco in 2016.",

    "html": "<p>Former Jaguars safety <person>Peyton Thompson</person> spoke out on Twitter that the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> and all of its organizations continue to release statements of fluff in the aftermath of <person>George Floyd's</person> death.</p>\n<p>And Thompson, who played in Jacksonville from 2014-17, stated that former Jaguars top executive <person>Tom Coughlin</person> and Coach <person>Doug Marrone</person> told players they couldn't kneel during the playing of the national anthem in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>\"I specifically remember <person>Tom Coughlin</person> and <person>Doug Marrone</person> telling us we couldn't kneel,\" Thompson wrote. \"Thank God we had an owner [<person>Shad Khan</person>] of a minority who weighed in and got us to kneel together. My job security was on the line if I supported my people.\"</p>\n\n<p>RELATED | See more <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131530\">Jacksonville Jaguars</org> coverage</p>\n\n<p>When the Jaguars played the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131525\">Baltimore Ravens</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> in <chron>September 2017</chron>, at least 15 players took a knee while owner <person>Shad Khan</person> and the rest of the team, including coaches and training staff, locked arms during the playing of the anthem.</p>\n\n<p>It was a show of unity at the time to protest President <person>Donald Trump's</person> controversial remarks about firing <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> players that kneeled during the national anthem that began in 2016 by former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> 49ers quarterback <person>Colin Kaepernick's</person> to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson posted on Tuesday that he had a healthy conversation with <person>Marrone Monday</person>, stating that they spoke of his career's work on equality and his efforts to make his players feel supported as well as the need to separate his actions from others in the organization.</p>\n\n<p>''But, we also spoke of a time when the organization had a third party come in and speak to the team in an attempt to convince us to change our stance,'' Thompson wrote. ''The reality is - the environment that was created in our facility wasn't safe for everyone to kneel peacefully in protest.</p>\n\n<p>''At least 60% of the team is of minority, including the owner, yet every player and coach across the league was scared to get 'Kaepernick'd, voices muffled by fear.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson stated the Jaguars now have the opportunity for a do-over, and he's hopeful Marrone's activism will lead the change for change this time around.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson took exception to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> Commissioner <person value=\"APIN:3944417093\">Roger Goodell's</person> statement in the wake of Floyd's death, \"<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> family is greatly saddened by the tragic events across our country and the protesters' reactions to these incidents reflect the pain, anger, and frustration that so many of us feel.\"</p>\n\n<p>Several <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> players, including <person>Eric Reed</person> and <person>Kenny Stills</person>, along with Thompson, criticized Goodell's statement as hypocrisy because of the way the league handled Kaepernick's kneeling protests.</p>\n\n<p>A free agent, Kaepernick has remained unsigned since his final season with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> in 2016.</p>",
