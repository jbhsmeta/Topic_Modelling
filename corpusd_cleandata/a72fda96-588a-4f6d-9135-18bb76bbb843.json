    "text": "BISMARCK, North Dakota, June 5 \\-- Gov. Doug Burgum, R-North Dakota, issued\nthe following news:\n\nGov. Doug Burgum accepted the resignation of Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation (DOCR) Director Leann Bertsch, thanking her for her 15 years of\ntransformational leadership as she leaves for the private sector, and\nappointed DOCR Director of Administration Dave Krabbenhoft as interim director\nof the department.\n\nBertsch was reappointed as DOCR director by Burgum in December 2016, having\nserved as director since first being appointed in 2005 by then-Gov. John\nHoeven. She has accepted the role of Senior Vice President-Corrections for\nUtah-based Management & Training Corporation (MTC), the nation's leading\noperator of federal Job Corps centers and one of the nation's leading\noperators of private correctional facilities. MTC operates 20 correctional\nfacilities and five detention centers in the United States, provides re-entry\nservices to approximately 30,000 probationers and parolees in the United\nKingdom, and operates, or partners in operating, 28 Job Corps centers across\nthe United States. MTC offers academic, vocational, substance abuse and social\nskills training.\n\nAs DOCR director, Bertsch has received national and international recognition\nfor her work to implement evidence-based practices throughout the North Dakota\ncorrections system, focusing resources on long-term offender behavior change.\nHer resignation is effective July 31.\n\n\"Leann has reshaped the corrections landscape in North Dakota and beyond with\ninnovative approaches and programs for youths and adults that focus on making\nbetter neighbors rather than better prisoners,\" Burgum said. \"We are saddened\nbut not surprised that the private sector has recruited her for her talents\nand transformational leadership. Leann has our deepest gratitude for her 15\nyears of exceptional leadership at DOCR, and we wish her all the best in this\nnext chapter of her career.\"\n\nIn her resignation letter, Bertsch thanked the governor for the opportunity to\nlead DOCR and said the department \"is well-positioned to continue the\ninnovative work that it has become known for.\"\n\n\"While this role has its challenges, I have had the opportunity to work with\nsome of the most talented corrections professionals in the nation,\" Bertsch\nstated. \"They are unsung heroes who perform demanding, sometimes dangerous,\nand always critical functions for the State of North Dakota. I will always be\ngrateful to have (led) such a remarkable agency.\"\n\nKrabbenhoft has served with DOCR since May 2002. As director of\nadministration, he has been highly involved in the state's criminal justice\nreforms and is responsible for business office operations, budgeting,\ninformation technology, plant services and medical services for all DOCR adult\nand juvenile services. He has served state government since 1985, including\nwith the State Auditor's Office, Department of Public Instruction and the\nOffice of Management and Budget.",
