    "text": "MUSCLE SHOALS \\- City Council members today are expected to approve the low\nbid for the purchase of a new fire boat that is being paid for through a U.S.\nDepartment of Homeland Security grant.\n\nFire Chief Shawn Malone drew up specifications for the vessel, which were\npublicly posted and sent to potential bidders.\n\nMalone described the boat as similar to a dive boat, but equipped with a 500\ngallon per minute pump and nozzle. It will be housed at Fire Station 3 near\nWilson Lake.\n\nThe Fire Department received a $48,000 grant to purchase the boat. No local\nmatch was needed, according to the chief.\n\nMalone said two bids were opened Friday.\n\nThe new vessel will give the city another tool to battle fires on the river,\nor homes and marinas on Wilson Lake. No emergency services agency in Colbert\nCounty has a fire boat.\n\nIf a bid is approved today, Malone said the new boat will likely arrive this\nsummer, depending on the manufacturer's timetable.\n\nMalone said the boat will have emergency lighting and a dive platform. In\naddition to fighting fires, Malone said the vessel can be used to set hazmat\nbooms, detect chemicals in the water or used in any type of water rescue\nsituation.\n\nThe council work session begins at 5:30 p.m. in the City Hall auditorium.",

It will be housed at <location>Fire Station</location> 3 near <location>Wilson Lake</location>.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Fire Department</org> received a <money>$48,000</money> grant to purchase the boat. No local match was needed, according to the chief.</p>\n\n<p>Malone said two bids were opened Friday.</p>\n\n<p>The new vessel will give the city another tool to battle fires on the river, or homes and marinas on <location>Wilson Lake</location>. No emergency services agency in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.al.colert\">Colbert County</location> has a fire boat.</p>\n\n<p>If a bid is approved today, Malone said the new boat will likely arrive this summer, depending on the manufacturer's timetable.</p>\n\n<p>Malone said the boat will have emergency lighting and a dive platform. In addition to fighting fires, Malone said the vessel can be used to set hazmat booms, detect chemicals in the water or used in any type of water rescue situation.</p>\n\n<p>The council work session begins at <chron>5:30 p.m.</chron> in the <location>City Hall</location> auditorium.</p>",
