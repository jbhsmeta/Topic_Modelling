    "text": "The global pandemic is on track to be the costliest event in insurance\nhistory. It's also a defining moment for the industry.\n\nPandemic topped the list of \"most extreme risks\" in a 2013 Towers Watson\nsurvey of insurance executives.\n\nIt never made the rankings again.\n\nSince then, cyberattacks have taken the lead as the most dangerous risk. But\nas the first five months of 2020 have proven, a computer virus has nothing on\na real one.\n\nKey Points I\n\nMaking History: The COVID-19 outbreak could dwarf other catastrophe losses\ninsurers have seen.\n\nSolid Ground: Even with the economic downturn, the insurance industry, on the\nwhole, is in a strong capital position.\n\nRise and Shine: Innovations in products and processes are expected to emerge\nfrom this catastrophe.\n\nCOVID-19 is like a hurricane that doesn't pass, a wildfire with no boundaries\nand a cyberattack that shuts down commerce. All at once. Crossing the globe.\nHitting the life, health, property, casualty and reinsurance sectors.\n\nIt's hard to quantify the full financial impact COVID-19 will have on the\nindustry. But one thing is certain: This pandemic is on track to become the\nlargest event in insurance history.\n\n\"It is truly a catastrophic event the proportion of which we have not seen\nbefore,\" Stefan Holzberger, chief rating officer for AM Best, said. \"The\nbreadth and depth of the event, how it is affecting multiple geographies and\nmultiple segments of the insurance market--this is really something that\ndwarfs the other major events in recent history.\n\n\"9/11, Katrina, going back a little further, Hurricane Andrew--those are the\nbig events that have shaped the industry. This will be another one.\"\n\nRobert Muir-Wood, the chief risk officer at modeling firm RMS, called COVID-19\n\"the biggest catastrophe we've seen in our lifetime.\" And John Head, the\npresident of national brokerage for Risk Placement Services, said, \"historic\nis absolutely the word I would use.\"\n\nThere is no shortage of superlatives to describe the widespread loss and\neconomic devastation caused by the COVID-19 catastrophe. As of early May, the\npandemic had touched 215 countries, taken more than a quarter-million lives,\nand caused a global recession.\n\n\"This was totally unanticipated,\" said Bob Hartwig, director of the Risk and\nUncertainty Management Center at the University of South Carolina's Darla\nMoore School of Business. \"The COVID-19 issue literally came upon the world\nthis year. There was no opportunity to react.\"\n\nAnd yet, the insurance industry has been prepared to handle this event.\n\nInsurers anticipate the worst and reassess after each significant event,\nlearning from their experiences. They added virus exclusions in response to\nthe 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. They adjusted\nfinancial strategies after the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\nThey may not have prepared specifically for a global pandemic, but their\nactions have left them well-positioned to absorb these losses on top of an\neconomic downturn.\n\n\"There are funds available to pay the claims, even with the unrealized losses\nacross multiple asset classes and the potential for further financial market\nvolatility,\" Holzberger said. \"The vast majority of companies in the U.S. are\nwell-positioned to ride out this period of volatility.\"\n\nThere is a caveat to this, however. The industry's ability to absorb the\nimpact of COVID-19 hinges on business interruption. As of early May, seven\nstates had introduced legislation requiring insurers to provide retroactive\nbusiness interruption coverage, in some cases regardless of whether policies\nincluded a virus exclusion, as most do.\n\nIf forced to pay retroactive BI, the insurance industry could be facing losses\nof $150 billion to $200 billion per month, according to the Best's Commentary,\nLegislation to Nullify BI Exclusions Poses Existential Threat to P/C Insurers.\nThe Insurance Information Institute's estimates are even higher. The III\nforecast costs of up to $380 billion per month, which it said would \"break\"\nthe insurance industry within months. That scenario, however, is unlikely (see\nsidebar page 54).\n\nIf you take business interruption out of the equation, the industry as a whole\nis on solid financial footing.\n\n\"We're built financially sound,\" James Lynch, chief actuary of the III, said.\n\"In the United States, we have $800 billion in surplus. Aside from the\nretroactive BI threat, it's clear the industry has the capacity to absorb the\nfinancial losses they're going to get from both directions--one direction\nbeing the losses they'll pay out and the other being the premium revenues they\nwon't receive.\"\n\nThat's no coincidence. Insurers got to this place because of past events.\n\nParallels from the Past\n\nDave Ingram, author of Willis Towers Watson's annual report on the most\ndangerous risks, understands why pandemic fell off the list.\n\nInsurers have experienced many health crises in the 21st century--SARS, avian\nflu, swine flu and the Ebola virus among them. But not since the 1918 Spanish\nflu has the world dealt with a pandemic of this magnitude.\n\n\"In the last 20 years, the danger of pandemic was always dissipated before it\nbecame an actual damaging event, at least to the insurance industry,\" said\nIngram, executive vice president in the enterprise risk management unit at\nWillis Re. \"In any management situation, you can be concerned about things,\nbut if they keep not happening, it's really hard to keep up intensity in\npreparing for them.\"\n\nBecause COVID-19 is unlike anything insurers have experienced, it's hard to\nfind parallels.\n\n\"There isn't a comparison to draw,\" said Simon Oddy, partner and forensic\naccountant for advisory firm Baker Tilly. \"There are only mini comparisons.\"\n\nThe 9/11 terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and the financial crisis of 2008-09\nare the most common ones.\n\n\"9/11 is the closest that the current generation of insurance professionals\nhas dealt with,\" Oddy said. \"But the magnitude is not the same. The issues\nfaced then were on a smaller level. ...I can't believe we're saying 9/11 was a\n'smaller level' than something.\"\n\nAccording to the III, the terrorist attacks led to $32.5 billion in insured\nlosses ($47 billion in today's money). It was the largest single event loss in\nhistory at the time, but has since been surpassed by 2005's Hurricane Katrina\n($52.8 billion today).\n\nIn early May, Willis Towers Watson estimated general insurance losses from\nCOVID-19 could reach $80 billion across key business classes in the United\nStates and United Kingdom. The company predicted the hardest-hit lines would\nbe workers' compensation in the United States and business\ninterruption/contingency in both countries. The latter, it said, could amount\nto $22.7 billion. The National Council on Compensation Insurance offered a\nstaggering range of losses--$2.7 billion to $81.5 billion\\--for U.S. workers'\ncompensation lines.\n\nThe similarities between COVID-19 and 9/11 extend beyond loss costs, however.\nThe biggest similarity is in the way both events have crossed business lines.\n\n\"9/11 had workers' compensation claims, liability claims, some directors and\nofficers claims, enormous property claims,\" the III's Lynch said. \"It was a\ntremendous business interruption event. Of all the lines that paid out, the\nlargest payout was business interruption claims, according to some\ncalculations III did at the time.\"\n\nThe pandemic also has been likened to a cyberattack, not only because of its\nability to reach across geographies and business lines but also because of its\npace.\n\n\"The pandemic is like a massively slow-moving cat,\" said Tom Johansmeyer, head\nof PCS, a Verisk business. \"Cyber can have a long development period up front\nuntil it becomes a cat. We see pandemic showing similar characteristics.\"\n\nPCS, which is the arbiter on catastrophes for the property sector, is not\ntracking COVID-19 losses. But it is watching them closely.\n\n\"We have a standard threshold that we use for determining whether or not\nsomething's a catastrophe in the United States,\" Johansmeyer said. \"That's a\n$25 million industrywide insured loss, a significant number of insurers and\ninsureds affected, and it's got to fit into one of our perils for storm\nfamilies that are predefined lists. We don't have a category for infectious\ndisease or virus. We're not going to add one on the fly.\"\n\nIn terms of its widespread economic impact, COVID-19 draws comparisons to the\nfinancial crisis of 2008-09.\n\n\"In the financial crisis, you had a tremendous market downturn, a period of\nfinancial volatility and a very hard-hit economy,\"AM Best's Holzberger\nsaid.\"But even that was not at the same magnitude. That was a Wall Street-type\nof issue with contagion into other financial markets.The way this pandemic is\nhitting businesses, local economies, state and national economies from the\nground up, truly is unprecedented.\n\n\"But a lot of the reason insurers are well-positioned right now is because of\nlessons learned in the 08-09 financial crisis,\" Holzberger said. \"'08-09 was\nin large part a liquidity event. Companies are more disciplined now in\nensuring they have appropriate access to liquidity to pay claims, to pay off\ndebt that might be maturing in their capital structure.\"\n\nFinancially Prepared\n\nOne of the first things AM Best did when COVID-19 hit was run a stress test.\nThe III did the same.\n\n\"We ran a stress test across all of our ratings globally, assuming a downturn\nin the financial market,\" Holzberger said. \"We wanted to see what risk-\nadjusted capital looked like based on some of the downward investment\nperformance that we had seen in the latter part of the first quarter and into\nthe second quarter.\n\n\"The early indications were that the P/C companies held up quite well to the\nstress test. The life and annuity and health care companies that we rate\nrequired more analysis and more conversation with companies to get comfort\nthat the rating was still appropriate. That's ongoing.\"\n\nThe III's approach was a bit different. It modeled coronavirus plus the worst\nnatural catastrophes on record. It wanted to know how the industry would fare\nif, on top of coronavirus, it suffered the worst hurricane ever (Katrina), the\nworst convective storm season ever (2011) and the worst wildfire season ever\n(2017). \"Even with all of those things put together, the industry would have\nplenty of capital,\" Lynch said. \"It can weather this storm.\"\n\nThat's not to say insurers aren't taking a big hit. First-quarter results\nshowed evidence they are, particularly in their investment portfolios.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, for example, posted a $49.7 billion net loss attributable\nto shareholders, which was driven by investment and derivative contract losses\nof $70.3 billion.\n\nHartford Financial's net income dropped 57%, a decrease it attributed to $231\nmillion in net realized capital losses.\n\n\"Many of the losses are being driven by realized losses on their investment\nportfolio,\" Hartwig said. \"That's because we entered the year on a bull market\nbut by early March the market had turned bearish. On March 23, which is very\nclose to the end of the quarter, we hit low points in the S&P and the Dow.\nBoth indexes shed one-third over their value in the span of a little more than\na month.\n\n\"At the same time, there were significant liquidity problems in the bond\nmarket, so bond values wound up plunging as well. These two factors drove the\nindustry to realize capital losses in the quarter. Fortunately, April was a\nstrong month for both stock and bond markets, so paper losses insurers\nsustained have been offset by recent gains.\"\n\nInsurers, however, are designed to withstand such volatility without any\ninterruption in their ability to pay claims or provide service.\n\n\"The industry's preference and, in fact, requirement to invest in high-grade\ncorporate and government bonds, meaning munis and Treasury securities, dates\nback decades,\" Hartwig said. \"This is why the industry will be able to\nwithstand the financial volatility from COVID-19, and why it was able to\nwithstand the global financial crisis in 2008 and '09, the economic turmoil\nthat surrounded 9/11 and other recessions that occurred in the 1990s.\"\n\nLessons Emerging\n\nThe full financial impact of COVID-19 may not be clear for a long time,\nlargely because insurers expect an onslaught of lawsuits relating to claims,\nbut also because we're still in the midst of it.\n\n\"Normally when we deal with a big cat, at some point it ends, usually\nrelatively quickly, and we can start the recovery process,\" Baker Tilly's Oddy\nsaid. \"The storm passes, you stand back and survey the damage, and you put\ninto operation your recovery effort. But here we are in a storm that will not\npass.\"\n\nStill, insurers already are thinking about the future.\n\n\"They're starting to talk about how we can be prepared for the next time,\"\nRPS's Head said. \"To me, this is a launching-off point for how to help\nourselves and our clients prepare for something similar in the future, much\nlike we did with terrorism after 9/11. This is going to change the way the\ninsurance industry does business in the future.\"\n\nThough it's still early days, some clear lessons already are taking shape. For\ninstance, the volume of claims from COVID-19, and the need to adjust them\nremotely in many cases, has brought insurtech into focus. The looming\nhurricane season will only exacerbate that. With above-average hurricane\nactivity predicted for this year and COVID-19 expected to continue\nindefinitely, insurers will be managing crises within a crisis while also\ntrying to meet policyholder expectations around customer service.\n\n\"The ability to deal with case volume, and the ability to deal with case\nvolume at an accelerated pace, is so important,\" Oddy said. \"The lives we lead\nare accelerated. It's a double-click mentality in most walks of life; the new\nexpectation is to have a massively accelerated process, whatever the process\nis. We're starting to see that in insurance, where there is a need for an\naccelerated response. This highlights that.\"\n\nTechnology and analytics also could allow commercial insurance to take more of\na usage-based approach, with policies audited regularly to ensure they reflect\ntrue exposure.\n\n\"We don't normally audit excess and umbrella policies,\" Head, of wholesale\nbroker RPS, said. \"They're agreed to at the beginning of the term, and no\nmatter what happens that premium stays the same. I believe insurance is going\nto be much better at using analytics to show what the true risk is.\n\n\"For example, if you're in the hospitality industry and you operate 12 months,\nand you're going to be down for three months due to this pandemic, your excess\nand umbrella policies should reflect that because exposure is down. Technology\nis going to allow us to do many more things on the spot.\"\n\nThe pandemic also spotlights the need for nimble underwriting that reflects\nnew risks. The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted business owners to adjust their\noperations, with sit-down restaurants becoming take-out restaurants and\nautomobile manufacturers shifting to producing medical supplies. Such changes\nalter exposures and risk profiles, particularly on the casualty side.\n\n\"If a restaurant is closed, we need to pivot and cover it as a vacant\nproperty,\" Head said. \"Or we have to consider whether a restaurant has new\nexposures, such as hired and non-owned auto, which we're seeing a lot of\nbecause restaurants are doing more delivery.\"\n\nBecause these shifts could be temporary, insurers need to be flexible in\ncrafting coverage. Head said many have been.\n\n\"A lot of our carrier partners have put some really good coverages together\nfor this hired or non-auto exposure that more than likely won't go on more\nthan six or nine months,\" Head said. \"So they're writing three-month policies\nfor folks.\n\n\"We're already starting to adapt, and I'm very proud of our industry.\"\n\nLook Ahead\n\nMuir-Wood, of RMS, expects to see a lot of creativity emerge from this period.\n\n\"It's always been the case that in the aftermath of the largest catastrophes,\nthe largest innovations occur and whole new lines of business for the\ninsurance sector turn up,\" he said. \"This is exactly that moment.\"\n\nOnce they catch their collective breath, insurers are likely to begin looking\nfor ways to address pandemic risk, both through some form of public-private\npartnership similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act and through new\nproducts. The latter will be more a dipping of the toe, experts said, as the\nindustry remains firm in its belief that pandemic risk is uninsurable on a\nbroad scale.\n\n\"I certainly expect, as there was after 9/11 and Katrina, an examination of\ncontract language,\" Hartwig said. \"You will see some adjustments to contract\nlanguage, which will be responsive to litigation against the industry, that\nwill seek to make the language even more crystal clear than it is today. Today\nwe might characterize exclusions for microorganisms such as viruses and\nbacteria to be ubiquitous. In the wake of this, they'll be universal.\n\n\"With a universal virus exclusion in place, you'll likely see insurers begin\nto experiment with coverages that would provide some limited amount of\ncoverage for pandemic events in the future,\" Hartwig said. \"In the same way\ninsurers have learned from past cyber events and developed products based on\ntheir understanding of those events, and worked very carefully to contain\ntheir exposure for those types of events, there is a possibility they could\nalso do that with respect to pandemic.\"\n\nParametric products are the early front-runner for doing so.\n\n\"With parametric triggers, you front-load the work,\" Baker Tilly's Oddy said.\n\"You've done your homework and preparation even before there's a loss event.\"\n\nJohansmeyer, of PCS, said industry loss warranties could be \"a very elegant\nsolution\" for business interruption.\n\n\"BI claims are fairly complex to adjust,\" he said. \"You need lawyers, you need\nforensic accountants, you need a lot of expert support. Those things take\ntime. Parametric works out really well because you don't need any of that. You\nuse some collection of authoritative data sources. Once the threshold is\nreached, payment is made, so loss adjustment expense goes way, way down. It\nbecomes a lot easier to manage.\"\n\nRMS created a pandemic model for business interruption in 2008, Muir-Wood\nsaid, but didn't bring it to market because demand for it at the time was\nlimited. There likely will be some interest now, and that model can serve as a\nskeleton for a new one.\n\n\"That 2008 model was built to the knowledge at the time,\" Muir-Wood said.\n\"That learning can be incorporated into what we offer. We will work closely\nwith sectors of the insurance and reinsurance market to find out what their\nappetite is.\"\n\nWhile Muir-Wood said there \"definitely will be\" interest in creating new\nparametric solutions, those conversations have remained on the margins thus\nfar.\n\n\"There's so much more for the industry to focus on right now,\" he said. \"We\nare like people in the middle of the hurricane. But a hurricane might take two\nor three days to go past, whereas COVID will take a year to go past. So we've\nhad some conversations, but it's not the priority right now.\n\n\"It will become the priority, though.\"\n\nGo to [bestreview.com](http://bestreview.com) to watch a video about this\nstory.\n\nby Kate Smith\n\nKate Smith is the managing editor of Best's Review.

    "html": "<p>The global pandemic is on track to be the costliest event in\ninsurance history. It's also a defining moment for the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Pandemic topped the list of \"most extreme risks\" in a\n2013 Towers Watson survey of insurance executives.</p>\n\n<p>It never made the rankings again.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, cyberattacks have taken the lead as the most dangerous\nrisk. But as the first five months of 2020 have proven, a computer virus\nhas nothing on a real one.</p>\n\n<p>Key Points I</p>\n\n<p>Making History: The COVID-19 outbreak could dwarf other catastrophe\nlosses insurers have seen.</p>\n\n<p>Solid Ground: Even with the economic downturn, the insurance\nindustry, on the whole, is in a strong capital position.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3912285876\">Rise and Shine</org>: Innovations in products and processes are expected\nto emerge from this catastrophe.</p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 is like a hurricane that doesn't pass, a wildfire\nwith no boundaries and a cyberattack that shuts down commerce. All at\nonce. Crossing the globe. Hitting the life, health, property, casualty\nand reinsurance sectors.</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to quantify the full financial impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the industry. But one thing is certain: This pandemic is on\ntrack to become the largest event in insurance history.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is truly a catastrophic event the proportion of which we\nhave not seen before,\" <person>Stefan Holzberger</person>, chief rating officer for\nAM Best, said. \"The breadth and depth of the event, how it is\naffecting multiple geographies and multiple segments of the insurance\nmarket--this is really something that dwarfs the other major events in\nrecent history.</p>\n\n<p>\"9/11, Katrina, going back a little further, Hurricane\nAndrew--those are the big events that have shaped the industry. This\nwill be another one.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Robert Muir-Wood</person>, the chief risk officer at modeling firm RMS,\ncalled COVID-19 \"the biggest catastrophe we've seen in our\nlifetime.\" And <person>John Head</person>, the president of national brokerage for\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2948742806\">Risk Placement Services</org>, said, \"historic is absolutely the word I\nwould use.\"</p>\n\n<p>There is no shortage of superlatives to describe the widespread\nloss and economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 catastrophe. As of\nearly May, the pandemic had touched 215 countries, taken more than a\nquarter-million lives, and caused a global recession.</p>\n\n<p>\"This was totally unanticipated,\" said <person>Bob Hartwig</person>,\ndirector of the Risk and Uncertainty Management Center at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1732644565\">University\nof South Carolina's</org> <org>Darla Moore School of Business</org>. \"The\nCOVID-19 issue literally came upon the world this year. There was no\nopportunity to react.\"</p>\n\n<p>And yet, the insurance industry has been prepared to handle this\nevent.</p>\n\n<p>Insurers anticipate the worst and reassess after each significant\nevent, learning from their experiences. They added virus exclusions in\nresponse to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak.\nThey adjusted financial strategies after the 2008-09 financial crisis.</p>\n\n<p>They may not have prepared specifically for a global pandemic, but\ntheir actions have left them well-positioned to absorb these losses on\ntop of an economic downturn.</p>\n\n<p>\"There are funds available to pay the claims, even with the\nunrealized losses across multiple asset classes and the potential for\nfurther financial market volatility,\" Holzberger said. \"The\nvast majority of companies in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> are well-positioned to ride out\nthis period of volatility.\"</p>\n\n<p>There is a caveat to this, however. The industry's ability to\nabsorb the impact of COVID-19 hinges on business interruption. As of\nearly May, seven states had introduced legislation requiring insurers to\nprovide retroactive business interruption coverage, in some cases\nregardless of whether policies included a virus exclusion, as most do.</p>\n\n<p>If forced to pay retroactive BI, the insurance industry could be\nfacing losses of <money>$150 billion</money> to <money>$200 billion</money> per month, according to\nthe Best's Commentary, Legislation to Nullify BI Exclusions Poses\nExistential Threat to P/C Insurers. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3472780265\">Insurance Information\nInstitute's</org> estimates are even higher. The III forecast costs of up\nto <money>$380 billion</money> per month, which it said would \"break\" the\ninsurance industry within months. That scenario, however, is unlikely\n(see sidebar page 54).</p>\n\n<p>If you take business interruption out of the equation, the industry\nas a whole is on solid financial footing.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're built financially sound,\" <person>James Lynch</person>, chief\nactuary of the III, said. \"In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, we have <money>$800\nbillion</money> in surplus. Aside from the retroactive BI threat, it's\nclear the industry has the capacity to absorb the financial losses\nthey're going to get from both directions--one direction being the\nlosses they'll pay out and the other being the premium revenues\nthey won't receive.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's no coincidence. Insurers got to this place because of\npast events.</p>\n\n<p>Parallels from the Past</p>\n\n<p><person>Dave Ingram</person>, author of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:WLTW\">Willis Towers Watson's</org> annual report on\nthe most dangerous risks, understands why pandemic fell off the list.</p>\n\n<p>Insurers have experienced many health crises in the 21st\ncentury--SARS, avian flu, swine flu and the Ebola virus among them. But\nnot since the 1918 Spanish flu has the world dealt with a pandemic of\nthis magnitude.</p>\n\n<p>\"In the last 20 years, the danger of pandemic was always\ndissipated before it became an actual damaging event, at least to the\ninsurance industry,\" said Ingram, executive vice president in the\nenterprise risk management unit at Willis Re. \"In any management\nsituation, you can be concerned about things, but if they keep not\nhappening, it's really hard to keep up intensity in preparing for\nthem.\"</p>\n\n<p>Because COVID-19 is unlike anything insurers have experienced,\nit's hard to find parallels.</p>\n\n<p>\"There isn't a comparison to draw,\" said <person>Simon Oddy</person>,\npartner and forensic accountant for advisory firm Baker Tilly.\n\"There are only mini comparisons.\"</p>\n\n<p>The 9/11 terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and the financial crisis\nof 2008-09 are the most common ones.</p>\n\n<p>\"9/11 is the closest that the current generation of insurance\nprofessionals has dealt with,\" Oddy said. \"But the magnitude\nis not the same. The issues faced then were on a smaller level. ...I\ncan't believe we're saying 9/11 was a 'smaller\nlevel' than something.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to the III, the terrorist attacks led to <money>$32.5 billion</money> in\ninsured losses (<money>$47 billion</money> in today's money). It was the largest\nsingle event loss in history at the time, but has since been surpassed\nby 2005's Hurricane Katrina (<money>$52.8 billion</money> today).</p>\n\n<p>In early May, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:WLTW\">Willis Towers Watson</org> estimated general insurance\nlosses from COVID-19 could reach <money>$80 billion</money> across key business classes\nin <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location>. The company predicted the\nhardest-hit lines would be workers' compensation in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United\nStates</location> and business interruption/contingency in both countries. The\nlatter, it said, could amount to <money>$22.7 billion</money>. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1193959330\">National Council on\nCompensation Insurance</org> offered a staggering range of losses--<money>$2.7\nbillion</money> to <money>$81.5 billion</money>--for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> workers' compensation lines.</p>\n\n<p>The similarities between COVID-19 and 9/11 extend beyond loss\ncosts, however. The biggest similarity is in the way both events have\ncrossed business lines.</p>\n\n<p>\"9/11 had workers' compensation claims, liability claims,\nsome directors and officers claims, enormous property claims,\" the\nIII's Lynch said. \"It was a tremendous business interruption\nevent. Of all the lines that paid out, the largest payout was business\ninterruption claims, according to some calculations III did at the\ntime.\"</p>\n\n<p>The pandemic also has been likened to a cyberattack, not only\nbecause of its ability to reach across geographies and business lines\nbut also because of its pace.</p>\n\n<p>\"The pandemic is like a massively slow-moving cat,\" said\n<person>Tom Johansmeyer</person>, head of PCS, a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1961958698\">Verisk</org> business. \"Cyber can have a\nlong development period up front until it becomes a cat. We see pandemic\nshowing similar characteristics.\"</p>\n\n<p>PCS, which is the arbiter on catastrophes for the property sector,\nis not tracking COVID-19 losses. But it is watching them closely.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have a standard threshold that we use for determining\nwhether or not something's a catastrophe in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United\nStates</location>,\" Johansmeyer said. \"That's a <money>$25 million</money>\nindustrywide insured loss, a significant number of insurers and insureds\naffected, and it's got to fit into one of our perils for storm\nfamilies that are predefined lists. We don't have a category for\ninfectious disease or virus. We're not going to add one on the\nfly.\"</p>\n\n<p>In terms of its widespread economic impact, COVID-19 draws\ncomparisons to the financial crisis of 2008-09.</p>\n\n<p>\"In the financial crisis, you had a tremendous market\ndownturn, a period of financial volatility and a very hard-hit\neconomy,\"AM Best's Holzberger said.\"But even that was not\nat the same magnitude. That was a <location>Wall Street</location>-type of issue with\ncontagion into other financial markets.The way this pandemic is hitting\nbusinesses, local economies, state and national economies from the\nground up, truly is unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>\"But a lot of the reason insurers are well-positioned right\nnow is because of lessons learned in the 08-09 financial crisis,\"\nHolzberger said. \"'08-09 was in large part a liquidity event.\nCompanies are more disciplined now in ensuring they have appropriate\naccess to liquidity to pay claims, to pay off debt that might be\nmaturing in their capital structure.\"</p>\n\n<p>Financially Prepared</p>\n\n<p>One of the first things AM Best did when COVID-19 hit was run a\nstress test. The III did the same.</p>\n\n<p>\"We ran a stress test across all of our ratings globally,\nassuming a downturn in the financial market,\" Holzberger said.\n\"We wanted to see what risk-adjusted capital looked like based on\nsome of the downward investment performance that we had seen in the\nlatter part of the first quarter and into the second quarter.</p>\n\n<p>\"The early indications were that the P/C companies held up\nquite well to the stress test. The life and annuity and health care\ncompanies that we rate required more analysis and more conversation with\ncompanies to get comfort that the rating was still appropriate.\nThat's ongoing.\"</p>\n\n<p>The III's approach was a bit different. It modeled coronavirus\nplus the worst natural catastrophes on record. It wanted to know how the\nindustry would fare if, on top of coronavirus, it suffered the worst\nhurricane ever (Katrina), the worst convective storm season ever (2011)\nand the worst wildfire season ever (2017). \"Even with all of those\nthings put together, the industry would have plenty of capital,\"\nLynch said. \"It can weather this storm.\"</p>\n\n<p>That's not to say insurers aren't taking a big hit.\nFirst-quarter results showed evidence they are, particularly in their\ninvestment portfolios.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BRK.B\">Berkshire Hathaway</org>, for example, posted a <money>$49.7 billion</money> net loss\nattributable to shareholders, which was driven by investment and\nderivative contract losses of <money>$70.3 billion</money>.</p>\n\n<p>Hartford Financial's net income dropped 57%, a decrease it\nattributed to <money>$231 million</money> in net realized capital losses.</p>\n\n<p>\"Many of the losses are being driven by realized losses on\ntheir investment portfolio,\" Hartwig said. \"That's\nbecause we entered the year on a bull market but by early March the\nmarket had turned bearish. On <chron>March 23</chron>, which is very close to the end\nof the quarter, we hit low points in the S&amp;P and the Dow. Both\nindexes shed one-third over their value in the span of a little more\nthan a month.</p>\n\n<p>\"At the same time, there were significant liquidity problems\nin the bond market, so bond values wound up plunging as well. These two\nfactors drove the industry to realize capital losses in the quarter.\nFortunately, April was a strong month for both stock and bond markets,\nso paper losses insurers sustained have been offset by recent\ngains.\"</p>\n\n<p>Insurers, however, are designed to withstand such volatility\nwithout any interruption in their ability to pay claims or provide\nservice.</p>\n\n<p>\"The industry's preference and, in fact, requirement to\ninvest in high-grade corporate and government bonds, meaning munis and\n<org>Treasury</org> securities, dates back decades,\" Hartwig said. \"This\nis why the industry will be able to withstand the financial volatility\nfrom COVID-19, and why it was able to withstand the global financial\ncrisis in 2008 and '09, the economic turmoil that surrounded 9/11\nand other recessions that occurred in the 1990s.\"</p>\n\n<p>Lessons Emerging</p>\n\n<p>The full financial impact of COVID-19 may not be clear for a long\ntime, largely because insurers expect an onslaught of lawsuits relating\nto claims, but also because we're still in the midst of it.</p>\n\n<p>\"Normally when we deal with a big cat, at some point it ends,\nusually relatively quickly, and we can start the recovery process,\"\n<person>Baker Tilly's</person> Oddy said. \"The storm passes, you stand back and\nsurvey the damage, and you put into operation your recovery effort. But\nhere we are in a storm that will not pass.\"</p>\n\n<p>Still, insurers already are thinking about the future.</p>\n\n<p>\"They're starting to talk about how we can be prepared\nfor the next time,\" RPS's Head said. \"To me, this is a\nlaunching-off point for how to help ourselves and our clients prepare\nfor something similar in the future, much like we did with terrorism\nafter 9/11. This is going to change the way the insurance industry does\nbusiness in the future.\"</p>\n\n<p>Though it's still early days, some clear lessons already are\ntaking shape. For instance, the volume of claims from COVID-19, and the\nneed to adjust them remotely in many cases, has brought insurtech into\nfocus. The looming hurricane season will only exacerbate that. With\nabove-average hurricane activity predicted for this year and COVID-19\nexpected to continue indefinitely, insurers will be managing crises\nwithin a crisis while also trying to meet policyholder expectations\naround customer service.</p>\n\n<p>\"The ability to deal with case volume, and the ability to deal\nwith case volume at an accelerated pace, is so important,\" Oddy\nsaid. \"The lives we lead are accelerated. It's a double-click\nmentality in most walks of life; the new expectation is to have a\nmassively accelerated process, whatever the process is. We're\nstarting to see that in insurance, where there is a need for an\naccelerated response. This highlights that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Technology and analytics also could allow commercial insurance to\ntake more of a usage-based approach, with policies audited regularly to\nensure they reflect true exposure.</p>\n\n<p>\"We don't normally audit excess and umbrella\npolicies,\" Head, of wholesale broker RPS, said. \"They're\nagreed to at the beginning of the term, and no matter what happens that\npremium stays the same. I believe insurance is going to be much better\nat using analytics to show what the true risk is.</p>\n\n<p>\"For example, if you're in the hospitality industry and\nyou operate 12 months, and you're going to be down for three months\ndue to this pandemic, your excess and umbrella policies should reflect\nthat because exposure is down. Technology is going to allow us to do\nmany more things on the spot.\"</p>\n\n<p>The pandemic also spotlights the need for nimble underwriting that\nreflects new risks. The COVID-19 outbreak has prompted business owners\nto adjust their operations, with sit-down restaurants becoming take-out\nrestaurants and automobile manufacturers shifting to producing medical\nsupplies. Such changes alter exposures and risk profiles, particularly\non the casualty side.</p>\n\n<p>\"If a restaurant is closed, we need to pivot and cover it as a\nvacant property,\" Head said. \"Or we have to consider whether a\nrestaurant has new exposures, such as hired and non-owned auto, which\nwe're seeing a lot of because restaurants are doing more\ndelivery.\"</p>\n\n<p>Because these shifts could be temporary, insurers need to be\nflexible in crafting coverage. Head said many have been.</p>\n\n<p>\"A lot of our carrier partners have put some really good\ncoverages together for this hired or non-auto exposure that more than\nlikely won't go on more than six or nine months,\" Head said.\n\"So they're writing three-month policies for folks.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're already starting to adapt, and I'm very proud\nof our industry.\"</p>\n\n<p>Look Ahead</p>\n\n<p>Muir-Wood, of RMS, expects to see a lot of creativity emerge from\nthis period.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's always been the case that in the aftermath of the\nlargest catastrophes, the largest innovations occur and whole new lines\nof business for the insurance sector turn up,\" he said. \"This\nis exactly that moment.\"</p>\n\n<p>Once they catch their collective breath, insurers are likely to\nbegin looking for ways to address pandemic risk, both through some form\nof public-private partnership similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance\nAct and through new products. The latter will be more a dipping of the\ntoe, experts said, as the industry remains firm in its belief that\npandemic risk is uninsurable on a broad scale.</p>\n\n<p>\"I certainly expect, as there was after 9/11 and Katrina, an\nexamination of contract language,\" Hartwig said. \"You will see\nsome adjustments to contract language, which will be responsive to\nlitigation against the industry, that will seek to make the language\neven more crystal clear than it is today. Today we might characterize\nexclusions for microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria to be\nubiquitous. In the wake of this, they'll be universal.</p>\n\n<p>\"With a universal virus exclusion in place, you'll likely\nsee insurers begin to experiment with coverages that would provide some\nlimited amount of coverage for pandemic events in the future,\"\nHartwig said. \"In the same way insurers have learned from past\ncyber events and developed products based on their understanding of\nthose events, and worked very carefully to contain their exposure for\nthose types of events, there is a possibility they could also do that\nwith respect to pandemic.\"</p>\n\n<p>Parametric products are the early front-runner for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>\"With parametric triggers, you front-load the work,\"\n<person>Baker Tilly's</person> Oddy said. \"You've done your homework and\npreparation even before there's a loss event.\"</p>\n\n<p>Johansmeyer, of PCS, said industry loss warranties could be \"a\nvery elegant solution\" for business interruption.</p>\n\n<p>\"BI claims are fairly complex to adjust,\" he said.\n\"You need lawyers, you need forensic accountants, you need a lot of\nexpert support. Those things take time. Parametric works out really well\nbecause you don't need any of that. You use some collection of\nauthoritative data sources. Once the threshold is reached, payment is\nmade, so loss adjustment expense goes way, way down. It becomes a lot\neasier to manage.\"</p>\n\n<p>RMS created a pandemic model for business interruption in 2008,\nMuir-Wood said, but didn't bring it to market because demand for it\nat the time was limited. There likely will be some interest now, and\nthat model can serve as a skeleton for a new one.</p>\n\n<p>\"That 2008 model was built to the knowledge at the time,\"\nMuir-Wood said. \"That learning can be incorporated into what we\noffer. We will work closely with sectors of the insurance and\nreinsurance market to find out what their appetite is.\"</p>\n\n<p>While Muir-Wood said there \"definitely will be\" interest\nin creating new parametric solutions, those conversations have remained\non the margins thus far.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's so much more for the industry to focus on right\nnow,\" he said. \"We are like people in the middle of the\nhurricane. But a hurricane might take two or three days to go past,\nwhereas COVID will take a year to go past. So we've had some\nconversations, but it's not the priority right now.</p>\n\n<p>\"It will become the priority, though.\"</p>\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://bestreview.com\">bestreview.com</a> to watch a video about this story.</p>\n\n<p>by <person>Kate Smith</person></p>\n\n<p><person>Kate Smith</person> is the managing editor of Best's Review.
