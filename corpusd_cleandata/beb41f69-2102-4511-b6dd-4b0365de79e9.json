The Pilot has organized the data to first show ZIP codes primarily located in Moore County, followed by ZIP codes that include Moore but are primarily based in different counties.</p>\n\n<p>The primary municipality for each ZIP code is listed, while the accompanying maps show the actual area covered by a particular ZIP code.</p>\n\n<p>Some cases may be reassigned to a different ZIP code by NCDHHS after an infected individual's residence has been verified. Because the agency does not report data for ZIP codes with fewer than 500 residents and less than five cases, the Lakeview community, population 305, is not included here.</p>\n\n<p>ZIP Codes Primarily Located in Moore County</p>\n\n<p>28374 (Pinehurst):</p>\n\n<p>86 Cases; Five Deaths</p>\n\n<p>27325 (Robbins):</p>\n\n<p>44 Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>28315 (Aberdeen):</p>\n\n<p>40 Cases: One Death</p>\n\n<p>28327 (Carthage):</p>\n\n<p>29 Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>28387 (Southern Pines):</p>\n\n<p>22 Cases; Two Deaths</p>\n\n<p>27376 (<location>West End</location>):</p>\n\n<p>17 Cases; One Death</p>\n\n<p>27281 (<location>Jackson Springs</location>):</p>\n\n<p>16 Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>28394 (Vass):</p>\n\n<p>Eight Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>28373 (Pinebluff):</p>\n\n<p>Six Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>27242 (<location>Eagle Springs</location>):</p>\n\n<p>Two Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>ZIP Codes Partially Located in Moore County</p>\n\n<p>27209 (Biscoe):</p>\n\n<p>61 Cases; Two Deaths</p>\n\n<p>28326 (Cameron):</p>\n\n<p>40 Cases; One Death</p>\n\n<p>27356 (Star):</p>\n\n<p>26 Cases; One Death</p>\n\n<p>27341 (Seagrove):</p>\n\n<p>16 Cases; No Deaths</p>\n\n<p>28347 (Hoffman):</p>\n\n<p>Four Cases; No Deaths</p>",
