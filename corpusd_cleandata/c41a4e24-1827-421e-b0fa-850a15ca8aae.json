    "text": "CAMBRIDGE \\- As many established businesses begin to reopen and reestablish\nthemselves in Illinois, two new shops opened Friday, May 29, in the Cambridge\narea: Excelsior Studio and Galleria and Fira du Boutique.\n\nExcelsior Studio and Galleria was supposed to open to the public in April, but\nthat was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe studio features 32 artists and includes stained glass, books, music,\ncrafts, soaps, lanterns, magnets, jewelry, garden art and all natural gels.\nMore artists will come in June.\n\nMelody Sloat and her husband, Jacob, bought the property last May. She said\nsome people thought they were crazy and that the property should have been\ntorn down because it was in such bad shape.\n\n\"We were literally out here working every single day - Christmas Day,\nChristmas Eve, Thanksgiving,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nShe said they knew it was a former one-room schoolhouse, and that's what they\ntook the name Excelsior from. They had had their own remodeling business, and\na friend, Marilyn Nelson, of the former quilt shop in Bishop Hill, told them\nthe building was actually two former schoolhouses that in the 1940s had been\nmerged together - Excelsior with the former Mount Pleasant outside Bishop\nHill.\n\n\"It was like a bonus. We got two historical buildings,\" Sloat said. \"It's a\nbeautiful space. I nicknamed it an art oasis in the middle of a cornfield.\"\n\nRegular hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Fridays, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays and 11\na.m.-4 p.m. Sundays. However, Sloat said she will open during the week by\nappointment, 309-945-7585. The galleria is located south of Cambridge at 13013\nN. 700th Avenue, Cambridge, at the intersection of Rt. 82 South and 700th\nAvenue.\n\n\"I know some people are not ready to be out, so I am more than willing to be\nopen during the week by appointment,\" Sloat said.\n\nFira du Boutique had been slated for a mid-March opening, but the coronavirus\nput that off. The store features women's clothing in longer-length, looser-fit\nstyles.\n\n\"I never got to open,\" owner Lynn Willis said. \"I didn't qualify for any\nfinancial assistance. I wasn't in business long enough or didn't have any\nemployees.\"\n\nWillis' grandparents were Swedish and grew up in the Bishop Hill-Galva area.\nThe name \"Fira du\" means \"celebrate you\" in Swedish.\n\n\"I'm ready to open,\" she said. \"I have precautions in place, and I even took\nsome extra precautions that weren't necessary.\"\n\nShe said she had a table set up with wet wipes, spray and hand disinfectant,\nand she uses a handheld UV light to go over the clothes to kill germs after\npeople have tried them on.\n\nWillis buys in small batches from 10 to 15 suppliers. Right now she has a\njewelry consignor, and she's planning to add more, as well as health and\nbeauty products.\n\n\"Almost all my merchandise is from a woman-based business and made in the\nUSA,\" she said. \"I always wanted my own business. I've been in retail my whole\nworking life. I lived in Bentonville, Arkansas \\- the home of Walmart \\- for\nabout 12 years and then came back to Galva.\"\n\nShe said she closed on the building at 115 N. Prospect in Cambridge on Dec.\n30, 2019, and remodeled it herself with the help of her son, Nicholas.\n\n\"It was definitely a labor of love,\" she noted.\n\nFira du's hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m.-3 p.m.\nSaturday and noon-4 p.m. Sunday. If people want to meet privately, they can\ncall to make an appointment during off hours at 309-937-1150. The website is\n[FiraduBoutique.com](http://FiraduBoutique.com).",

More artists will come in June.</p>\n\n<p><person>Melody Sloat</person> and her husband, Jacob, bought the property last May. She said some people thought they were crazy and that the property should have been torn down because it was in such bad shape.</p>\n\n<p>\"We were literally out here working every single day - <chron>Christmas Day</chron>, <chron>Christmas Eve</chron>, <chron>Thanksgiving</chron>,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of work to do.\"</p>\n\n<p>She said they knew it was a former one-room schoolhouse, and that's what they took the name Excelsior from. They had had their own remodeling business, and a friend, <person>Marilyn Nelson</person>, of the former quilt shop in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.bisill\">Bishop Hill</location>, told them the building was actually two former schoolhouses that in the 1940s had been merged together - Excelsior with the former <location>Mount Pleasant</location> outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.bisill\">Bishop Hill</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was like a bonus. We got two historical buildings,\" Sloat said. \"It's a beautiful space. I nicknamed it an art oasis in the middle of a cornfield.\"</p>\n\n<p>Regular hours are <chron>10 a.m.-6 p.m. Fridays</chron>, <chron>10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays</chron> and <chron>11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sundays</chron>. However, Sloat said she will open during the week by appointment, 309-945-7585. The galleria is located south of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.cambri\">Cambridge</location> at <location>13013 N. 700th Avenue</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.cambri\">Cambridge</location>, at the intersection of Rt. 82 South and <location>700th Avenue</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"I know some people are not ready to be out, so I am more than willing to be open during the week by appointment,\" Sloat said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Fira du Boutique</person> had been slated for a mid-March opening, but the coronavirus put that off. The store features women's clothing in longer-length, looser-fit styles.</p>\n\n<p>\"I never got to open,\" owner <person>Lynn Willis</person> said. \"I didn't qualify for any financial assistance. I wasn't in business long enough or didn't have any employees.\"</p>\n\n<p>Willis' grandparents were Swedish and grew up in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.bisill\">Bishop Hill</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.galva\">Galva</location> area. The name \"Fira du\" means \"celebrate you\" in Swedish.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm ready to open,\" she said. \"I have precautions in place, and I even took some extra precautions that weren't necessary.\"</p>\n\n<p>She said she had a table set up with wet wipes, spray and hand disinfectant, and she uses a handheld UV light to go over the clothes to kill germs after people have tried them on.</p>\n\n<p>Willis buys in small batches from 10 to 15 suppliers. Right now she has a jewelry consignor, and she's planning to add more, as well as health and beauty products.</p>\n\n<p>\"Almost all my merchandise is from a woman-based business and made in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">USA</location>,\" she said. \"I always wanted my own business. I've been in retail my whole working life. I lived in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ar.benlle\">Bentonville, Arkansas</location> - the home of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:WMT\">Walmart</org> - for about 12 years and then came back to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.galva\">Galva</location>.\"</p>\n\n<p>She said she closed on the building at 115 N. Prospect in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.cambri\">Cambridge</location> on <chron>Dec. 30, 2019</chron>, and remodeled it herself with the help of her son, Nicholas.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was definitely a labor of love,\" she noted.</p>\n\n<p><person>Fira du's</person> hours are <chron>10 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday</chron>, <chron>10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday</chron> and <chron>noon-4 p.m. Sunday</chron>. If people want to meet privately, they can call to make an appointment during off hours at 309-937-1150. The website is <a href=\"http://FiraduBoutique.com\">FiraduBoutique.com</a>.</p>",
