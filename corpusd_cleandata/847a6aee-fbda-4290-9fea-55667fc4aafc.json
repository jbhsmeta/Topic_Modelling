    "text": "The Associated Press\n\nHONG KONG \\- Thousands of people in Hong Kong defied a police ban Thursday\nevening, breaking through barricades to hold a candlelight vigil on the 31st\nanniversary of China's crushing of a democracy movement centered on Beijing's\nTiananmen Square.\n\nWith democracy snuffed out in the mainland, the focus has shifted increasingly\nto semi-autonomous Hong Kong, where authorities for the first time banned the\nannual vigil that remembers victims of the 1989 crackdown.\n\nBeijing is taking a tougher stance following months of anti-government\nprotests last year, in what activists see as an accelerating erosion of the\ncity's rights and liberties. Earlier Thursday, the Hong Kong legislature\npassed a law making it a crime to disrespect China's national anthem. Pro-\ndemocracy lawmakers disrupted proceeding twice to try to prevent the vote.\n\nDespite the police ban, crowds poured into Victoria Park to light candles and\nobserve a minute of silence. Many chanted \"Democracy now\"and \"Stand for\nfreedom, stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nWhile police played recordings warning people not to participate in the\nunauthorized gathering, they did little to stop people from entering the park.\nAuthorities had cited the need for social distancing during the coronavirus\npandemic in barricading the sprawling park, but activists saw the outbreak as\na convenient excuse.\n\n\"If we don't come out today, we don't even know if we can still come out next\nyear,\" said participant Serena Cheung.\n\nPolice said they made arrests in the city's Mongkok district, where large\ncrowds also rallied. When several protesters tried to block a road, officers\nrushed to detain them, using pepper spray and raising a blue flag to warn them\nto disperse or they would use force on the unauthorized gathering. On Twitter,\nthey urged people not to gather in groups because of the coronavirus.\n\nHundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed when tanks and troops\nmoved in on Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4, 1989, to break up weeks of\nstudent-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat\nto Communist Party rule.\n\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson offered the government's standard\ndefense of the 1989 crackdown.\n\n\"The Chinese government has made a clear conclusion about the political\ndisturbance that occurred in the late 1980s,\" Zhao Lijian said. \"The great\nachievements that we have achieved ... have fully demonstrated that the\ndevelopment path China has chosen is completely correct.\"",

Earlier Thursday, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> legislature passed a law making it a crime to disrespect <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location> national anthem. Pro-democracy lawmakers disrupted proceeding twice to try to prevent the vote.</p>\n<p>Despite the police ban, crowds poured into <location>Victoria Park</location> to light candles and observe a minute of silence. Many chanted \"Democracy now\"and \"Stand for freedom, stand with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location>.\"</p>\n<p>While police played recordings warning people not to participate in the unauthorized gathering, they did little to stop people from entering the park. Authorities had cited the need for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic in barricading the sprawling park, but activists saw the outbreak as a convenient excuse.</p>\n<p>\"If we don't come out today, we don't even know if we can still come out next year,\" said participant <person>Serena Cheung</person>.</p>\n<p>Police said they made arrests in the city's Mongkok district, where large crowds also rallied. When several protesters tried to block a road, officers rushed to detain them, using pepper spray and raising a blue flag to warn them to disperse or they would use force on the unauthorized gathering. On Twitter, they urged people not to gather in groups because of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed when tanks and troops moved in on <location>Tiananmen Square</location> the night of <chron>June 3-4, 1989</chron>, to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to <org>Communist Party</org> rule.</p>\n<p>A <org>Chinese Foreign Ministry</org> spokesperson offered the government's standard defense of the 1989 crackdown.</p>\n<p>\"The Chinese government has made a clear conclusion about the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s,\" Zhao Lijian said. \"The great achievements that we have achieved ... have fully demonstrated that the development path <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> has chosen is completely correct.\"</p>",
