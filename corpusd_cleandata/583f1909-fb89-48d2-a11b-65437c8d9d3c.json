    "text": "Editor's note: The above video may be disturbing to some. Viewer discretion is\nadvised.\n\nATLANTA (WSAV) - Atlanta's mayor says two city police investigators have been\nfired and three officers are on desk duty following an arrest Saturday\ninvolving two college students.\n\nMayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the police used excessive force while\narresting Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim, students at Morehouse College and\nSpelman College respectively.\n\nThe investigators, identified as Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter, were part of\nthe Atlanta Police Department's (APD) Fugitive Unit. On Saturday, they were\nassisting with civil disturbances in the city when the incident involving\nYoung and Pilgrim occurred.\n\nGardner served APD for 22 years and Streeter had been with the department\nsince 2003.\n\nVideo of the incident, that first gained attention online and on local news,\nshows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surrounding a car\nbeing driven by the students. The officers pulled Pilgrim out of the vehicle\nand appeared to use a stun gun on the vehicle's occupants.\n\nThe two students did not appear to be fighting the police. Bottoms said\nPilgrim was released without charges. She also said she was ordering the\ncharges against Young be dropped.\n\nThe mayor said she and APD Chief Erika Shields made the decision to fire the\nofficers after reviewing body-camera footage.\n\n\"Use of excessive force is never acceptable,\" Bottoms told reporters Sunday.\nShields called the footage \"really shocking to watch\" and apologized to the\nstudents.\n\nSaturday night, more than 150 people were arrested for various violations\nduring the protest, according to the mayor.\n\nShields praised other officers, many who are having knives and rocks thrown at\nthem. One is in intensive care following a collision with an ATV.\n\nThe city remains under a curfew from 9 p.m. until Monday morning. Bottoms said\nit may be extended.",

Viewer discretion is advised.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">ATLANTA</location> (WSAV) - <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">Atlanta's</location> mayor says two city police investigators have been fired and three officers are on desk duty following an arrest Saturday involving two college students.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor <person>Keisha Lance Bottoms</person> said the police used excessive force while arresting <person>Messiah Young</person> and <person>Taniyah Pilgrim</person>, students at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0449282962\">Morehouse College</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2596235010\">Spelman College</org> respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The investigators, identified as <person>Mark Gardner</person> and <person>Ivory Streeter</person>, were part of the <org>Atlanta Police Department's</org> (APD) Fugitive Unit. On Saturday, they were assisting with civil disturbances in the city when the incident involving Young and Pilgrim occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Gardner served APD for 22 years and Streeter had been with the department since 2003.</p>\n\n<p>Video of the incident, that first gained attention online and on local news, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surrounding a car being driven by the students. The officers pulled Pilgrim out of the vehicle and appeared to use a stun gun on the vehicle's occupants.</p>\n\n<p>The two students did not appear to be fighting the police. Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges. She also said she was ordering the charges against Young be dropped.</p>\n\n<p>The mayor said she and APD Chief <person>Erika Shields</person> made the decision to fire the officers after reviewing body-camera footage.</p>\n\n<p>\"Use of excessive force is never acceptable,\" Bottoms told reporters Sunday. Shields called the footage \"really shocking to watch\" and apologized to the students.</p>\n\n<p>Saturday night, more than 150 people were arrested for various violations during the protest, according to the mayor.</p>\n\n<p>Shields praised other officers, many who are having knives and rocks thrown at them. One is in intensive care following a collision with an ATV.</p>\n\n<p>The city remains under a curfew from <chron>9 p.m.</chron> until Monday morning. Bottoms said it may be extended.</p>",
