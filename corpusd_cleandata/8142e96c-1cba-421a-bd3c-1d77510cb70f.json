    "text": "DR. FAUCI HAS gone Hollywood!\n\nThe infectious disease expert - a prominent member of the White House's\ncoronavirus task force - may have fallen out of favor with our pandemic-\nclueless president, but he's a huge hit with the entertainment community.\n\nJulia Roberts went gaga over the esteemed doctor with the raspy voice last\nweek in a virtual chat she had with him on her Instagram page. \"You truly have\nemerged as a personal hero for me,\" the star gushed. \"Just to have this little\ncorner of your time ... is such a joy.\"\n\nRoberts was among a throng of celebrities, including Millie Bobby Brown,\nPenelope Cruz, David Oyelowo, Shailene Woodley, Robin Wright, Danai Gurira and\nSarah Jessica Parker, to hand over their Instagram accounts to global health\nleaders and experts as part of the #PasstheMic campaign to raise COVID-19\nawareness.\n\nSpeaking to Roberts' 8 million followers, Fauci shared his views on the\npandemic and treatment research and urged the public to be \"cautiously\noptimistic\" as the country reopens public spaces and businesses.\n\nThis was a great megaphone for the doctor, who has been weirdly MIA from TV\nnews programs after having dominated the airwaves early in the crisis, and it\nwas good for the public to hear from someone who actually knows what he's\ntalking about from a medical and scientific standpoint.\n\nFauci has infuriated Trump with his truth-telling remarks about COVID-19,\nflying in the face of the president's misleading propaganda. Trump slammed the\ndoctor's recent testimony at a Senate hearing where he warned about the risks\nof lifting pandemic restrictions too soon.\n\nI think the president is just plain jealous of Fauci's popularity and the\nlovefest he's enjoying from Hollywood. The good doctor even got his wish\nfulfilled when his favorite actor did a spot-on impression of him on \"Saturday\nNight Live.\" Fauci's review: \"I'm a great fan of Brad Pitt, and that's the\nreason why when people ask me who I would like to play me, I mention Brad\nPitt. I think he did a great job.\"\n\nNaturally, Trump was much less gracious about Alec Baldwin's \"terrible\"\nimpression of him on \"SNL.\" Who could forget his embarrassing tweet about the\nactor, misspelling \"dieing career.\" Perhaps he was comparing his own prospects\nwith Dr. Fauci's?\n\nMy note to Trump: Fauci upstages you in every regard.\n\nClaudia Eller\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n\"I think the president is just plain jealous of Fauci's popularity and the\nlovefest he's enjoying from Hollywood.\"",

Trump slammed the doctor's recent testimony at a <org>Senate</org> hearing where he warned about the risks of lifting pandemic restrictions too soon.</p>\n<p>I think the president is just plain jealous of Fauci's popularity and the lovefest he's enjoying from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.hollyw\">Hollywood</location>. The good doctor even got his wish fulfilled when his favorite actor did a spot-on impression of him on \"<org>Saturday Night Live</org>.\" Fauci's review: \"I'm a great fan of <person>Brad Pitt</person>, and that's the reason why when people ask me who I would like to play me, I mention <person>Brad Pitt</person>. I think he did a great job.\"</p>\n<p>Naturally, Trump was much less gracious about <person>Alec Baldwin's</person> \"terrible\" impression of him on \"<org>SNL</org>.\" Who could forget his embarrassing tweet about the actor, misspelling \"dieing career.\" Perhaps he was comparing his own prospects with <person>Dr. Fauci's</person>?</p>\n<p>My note to Trump: Fauci upstages you in every regard.</p>\n<p><person>Claudia Eller</person></p>\n<p>Editor-in-Chief</p>\n<p>\"I think the president is just plain jealous of Fauci's popularity and the lovefest he's enjoying from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.hollyw\">Hollywood</location>.\"</p>",
