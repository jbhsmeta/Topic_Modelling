    "text": "By Joanne ChiuInternational markets were little changed, with persistent\nconcerns over the pace of economic recovery tempering investor appetite after\na recent rally.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced slightly in Friday-morning\ntrading. E-mini S&P 500 futures rose 0.3%, suggesting U.S. stocks could rise\nFriday. Benchmarks in mainland China, Japan and Australia pulled back\nmodestly. South Korea's Kospi Composite rose more than half a percent.On\nThursday the S&P 500 broke a four-session winning streak as disappointing\ntrade and job data showed the coronavirus pandemic's continued toll on the\neconomy.Equity markets and the broader economy are disconnected, said Daryl\nLiew, chief investment officer at REYL Singapore.The recent stock-market surge\nwas partly driven by massive stimulus, plus optimism over \"the loosening of\nrestrictions across the world and the expectations that we could see a\nV-shaped recovery,\" he said.\"However, we haven't really seen that in the\nbroader economy yet,\" Mr. Liew said. He said if business activity doesn't\nrebound by the third quarter, \"governments might have to do more because\notherwise you're going to see a flood of bankruptcies and insolvencies.\"Mr.\nLiew said he is holding more cash after reducing his holdings of shares\nbecause of uncertainties including potential new waves of coronavirus\ninfections in some countries, and escalating U.S.-China tension ahead of the\nU.S. presidential election in November.Lewis Wan, chief investment officer at\nPride Investments Group, said he is cautious on equities following a global\nrebound. In dollar terms, the MSCI All Country World Index had jumped 37.5% as\nof Thursday, compared with its low on March 23, according to FactSet.\"We're\nprobably going to see more volatility in equities until there's more certainty\nover the development of vaccines,\" and the U.S.-China relationship stabilizes,\nhe said. Mr. Wan said any resurgence of new coronavirus infections could\ndamage already fragile investor confidence.The WSJ Dollar Index, which\nmeasures the U.S. currency against 16 others, was little changed at 91.22 on\nFriday in Asian trading hours. As measured by this index, the dollar has\nweakened for eight of the last 9 trading sessions to Thursday, and has\nretreated nearly 6% from a peak in late March, according to Dow Jones Market\nData.Write to Joanne Chiu at\n[joanne.chiu@wsj.com](mailto:joanne.chiu@wsj.com)(END) Dow Jones NewswiresJune\n05, 2020 00:46 ET (04:46 GMT)",

    "html": "<p>By <person>Joanne ChiuInternational</person> markets were little changed, with persistent concerns over the pace of economic recovery tempering investor appetite after a recent rally.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced slightly in Friday-morning trading. E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.3%, suggesting <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> stocks could rise Friday. Benchmarks in mainland <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> pulled back modestly. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea's</location> Kospi Composite rose more than half a percent.On Thursday the S&amp;P 500 broke a four-session winning streak as disappointing trade and job data showed the coronavirus pandemic's continued toll on the economy.Equity markets and the broader economy are disconnected, said <person>Daryl Liew</person>, chief investment officer at REYL Singapore.The recent stock-market surge was partly driven by massive stimulus, plus optimism over \"the loosening of restrictions across the world and the expectations that we could see a V-shaped recovery,\" he said.\"However, we haven't really seen that in the broader economy yet,\" <person>Mr. Liew</person> said. He said if business activity doesn't rebound by the third quarter, \"governments might have to do more because otherwise you're going to see a flood of bankruptcies and insolvencies.\"<person>Mr. Liew</person> said he is holding more cash after reducing his holdings of shares because of uncertainties including potential new waves of coronavirus infections in some countries, and escalating <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> tension ahead of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> presidential election in November.<person>Lewis Wan</person>, chief investment officer at <org>Pride Investments Group</org>, said he is cautious on equities following a global rebound. In dollar terms, the MSCI All Country World Index had jumped 37.5% as of Thursday, compared with its low on <chron>March 23</chron>, according to FactSet.\"We're probably going to see more volatility in equities until there's more certainty over the development of vaccines,\" and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> relationship stabilizes, he said. <person>Mr. Wan</person> said any resurgence of new coronavirus infections could damage already fragile investor confidence.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> currency against 16 others, was little changed at 91.22 on Friday in Asian trading hours. As measured by this index, the dollar has weakened for eight of the last 9 trading sessions to Thursday, and has retreated nearly 6% from a peak in late March, according to Dow Jones Market Data.Write to <person>Joanne Chiu</person> at <a href=\"mailto:joanne.chiu@wsj.com\">joanne.chiu@wsj.com</a>(END) Dow Jones NewswiresJune 05, 2020 <chron>00:46 ET</chron> (<chron>04:46 GMT</chron>)</p>",
