    "text": "GRANTS - The United States currently has two defense needs for domestically\nmined uranium: low-enriched uranium to produce tritium for nuclear weapons,\nand highly-enriched uranium to fuel nuclear reactors in Navy submarines and\naircraft carriers.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration has\nsufficient stockpiles of unobligated uranium to support tritium production\nuntil 2041 and Navy fuel until the 2050s, according to the U.S. Nuclear Fuel\nWorking Group, established in 2019 by President Donald Trump.\n\nWith uranium supplies available to meet the country's needs for the next two\nto three decades, why would the Working Group recommend creating a second\nuranium reserve?\n\n\"The coronavirus pandemic has reminded us that foreign nations do not\nnecessarily have America's best interests in mind,\" Energy Secretary Dan\nBrouillette wrote in a May 28 letter regarding what must be done to revive\nAmerica's nuclear energy industry and restore the United States' competitive\nadvantage.\n\nThe country's long-term ability to build new nuclear warheads and fuel its\nsubmarines and aircraft carriers depends on the domestic production of\nuranium, as civil nuclear-cooperation agreements prevent foreign suppliers\nfrom providing the element for military purposes, he said.\n\nCreating a reserve\n\nThe Working Group strategy calls for funding advanced research, development,\nand deployment of America's next generation of nuclear energy technologies to\nensure the country's long-term global competitiveness and maintain its non-\nproliferation leadership.\n\n\"From health care to energy, the global battle for supremacy and influence\ncontinues unabated. If we are to remain a safe, secure, and prosperous country\nin an increasingly hostile world, we must take these important steps to\nprotect Americans at home and our interests abroad,\" Brouillette wrote.\n\nThe Strategy to Restore American Nuclear Energy Leadership, a report released\nin April by the Working Group, and the President's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget\nRequest, published in February, propose establishing a uranium reserve for the\nUnited States to \"provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in\nthe event of a market disruption.\"\n\nIt is expected that the reserve would directly support the operation of at\nleast two U.S. uranium mines and the reestablishment of active domestic\nconversion capabilities.\n\nEnergy Fuels Inc.'s White Mesa Mill near Blanding, Utah, produces two minerals\non the U.S. government's list of minerals deemed critical to national and\neconomic security \u0096 uranium and vanadium. As the country's top uranium\nproducer, having overtaken Cameco, Energy Fuels is hoping to have an active\nrole in supplying the new uranium reserve.\n\n\u0091Next giant leap'\n\nIn addition to energy and defense applications for uranium on Earth, as part\nof a broader strategy to regain American global leadership in nuclear energy,\nthe Department of Energy is leading efforts with the private sector to promote\nthe development and deployment of small modular reactors and microreactors\nwith its sights set on the \"final frontier.\"\n\nThose reactor technologies could be modified to provide sustainable power\nsources for space applications such as surface power and nuclear thermal\npropulsion. DOE already is working with colleagues at NASA and the Department\nof Defense on applications of those technologies, Brouillette stated in\nremarks to the National Space Council May 19.\n\nUnder the new lunar exploration program \"Artemis,\" named in 2019 for the\ngoddess of the Moon and twin sister of Apollo, NASA will send new science\ninstruments and technology demonstrations to study the Moon, accelerate plans\nto send astronauts to the Moon by 2024, and establish sustainable lunar\nexploration by 2028.\n\nDOE has been meeting regularly with colleagues at NASA \"to better align space\nprogram activities to support America's return to the Moon, its next giant\nleap to Mars, and its future beyond,\" Brouillette said.\n\n\"In particular, we are partnering with NASA to demonstrate nuclear thermal\npropulsion and surface fission reactors, which will support power requirements\nfor crew transportation to the Moon and eventually Mars, as well as help power\nour envisioned outposts there,\" Brouillette said.\n\n\"With nuclear propulsion, we can potentially cut the time of space travel to\nMars by half, while offering increased mission flexibility,\" he said.",

If we are to remain a safe, secure, and prosperous country in an increasingly hostile world, we must take these important steps to protect Americans at home and our interests abroad,\" Brouillette wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The Strategy to Restore American Nuclear Energy Leadership, a report released in April by the <org>Working Group</org>, and the President's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Request, published in February, propose establishing a uranium reserve for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> to \"provide additional assurances of availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is expected that the reserve would directly support the operation of at least two <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> uranium mines and the reestablishment of active domestic conversion capabilities.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"AMEX:UUUU\">Energy Fuels Inc.'s</org> <location>White Mesa Mill</location> near <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.blaing\">Blanding, Utah</location>, produces two minerals on the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> government's list of minerals deemed critical to national and economic security &#150; uranium and vanadium. As the country's top uranium producer, having overtaken <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:CCJ\">Cameco</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"AMEX:UUUU\">Energy Fuels</org> is hoping to have an active role in supplying the new uranium reserve.</p>\n\n<p>&#145;Next giant leap'</p>\n\n<p>In addition to energy and defense applications for uranium on Earth, as part of a broader strategy to regain American global leadership in nuclear energy, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0144036385\">Department of Energy</org> is leading efforts with the private sector to promote the development and deployment of small modular reactors and microreactors with its sights set on the \"final frontier.\"</p>\n\n<p>Those reactor technologies could be modified to provide sustainable power sources for space applications such as surface power and nuclear thermal propulsion. <org>DOE</org> already is working with colleagues at NASA and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4095884156\">Department of Defense</org> on applications of those technologies, Brouillette stated in remarks to the <org>National Space Council</org> <chron>May 19</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Under the new lunar exploration program \"Artemis,\" named in 2019 for the goddess of the Moon and twin sister of Apollo, NASA will send new science instruments and technology demonstrations to study the Moon, accelerate plans to send astronauts to the Moon by 2024, and establish sustainable lunar exploration by 2028.</p>\n\n<p><org>DOE</org> has been meeting regularly with colleagues at NASA \"to better align space program activities to support America's return to the Moon, its next giant leap to Mars, and its future beyond,\" Brouillette said.</p>\n\n<p>\"In particular, we are partnering with NASA to demonstrate nuclear thermal propulsion and surface fission reactors, which will support power requirements for crew transportation to the Moon and eventually Mars, as well as help power our envisioned outposts there,\" Brouillette said.</p>\n\n<p>\"With nuclear propulsion, we can potentially cut the time of space travel to Mars by half, while offering increased mission flexibility,\" he said.</p>",
