    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy\nand Law Daily \\-- Fresh data on environmental research and public health are\npresented in a new report. According to news originating from Seoul, South\nKorea, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The study provides evidence\nof the governance and its context according to the introduction of the New\nDiagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs)-based payment system in Korea. In-depth\ninterviews with 14 core policy elites from four health areas were conducted.\"\n\nOur news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Seoul Institute:\n\"As governance is a multidimensional concept, interviewees were asked to\nevaluate different dimensions based on the World Bank's five elements\n(Coherent decision-making structures, Consistency and Stability, Stakeholder\nparticipation, Supervision and Regulation, and Transparency and Information).\nOverall, the new payment system was perceived as poorly governed. Since its\nintroduction, it has not offered a new governance perspective because it used\na conventional top-down approach, while political windows for cooperation were\nnot wide open. Of the five governance dimensions, the scores were lowest in\nStakeholder participation. There was a large perception gap between physicians\nand government officers here. Participants from academia perceived Consistency\nand Stability as ineffectively governed. In the meantime, the government has\nmainly created health policy in Korea.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"As a result,\nstakeholder participation, especially the participation of medical personnel,\nhas been insufficient in the process of health policy formulation. The study\nsuggests that the decision-making process in health policy needs to be more\nparticipatory and reliable, with governance regarded as a high priority.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Evaluation of Health Policy\nGovernance in the Introduction of the New DRG-Based Hospital Payment System\nfrom Interviews with Policy Elites in South Korea. _International Journal of\nEnvironmental Research and Public Health_ , 2020,17(3757):3757.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Health Policy and Law Daily</org> -- Fresh data on environmental research and public health are presented in a new report. According to news originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/kr..seoul\">Seoul, South Korea</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;The study provides evidence of the governance and its context according to the introduction of the New Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs)-based payment system in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">Korea</location>. In-depth interviews with 14 core policy elites from four health areas were conducted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from <org>Seoul Institute</org>: &#8220;As governance is a multidimensional concept, interviewees were asked to evaluate different dimensions based on the World Bank&#8217;s five elements (Coherent decision-making structures, Consistency and Stability, Stakeholder participation, Supervision and Regulation, and Transparency and Information). Overall, the new payment system was perceived as poorly governed. Since its introduction, it has not offered a new governance perspective because it used a conventional top-down approach, while political windows for cooperation were not wide open. Of the five governance dimensions, the scores were lowest in Stakeholder participation. There was a large perception gap between physicians and government officers here. Participants from academia perceived Consistency and Stability as ineffectively governed. In the meantime, the government has mainly created health policy in Korea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;As a result, stakeholder participation, especially the participation of medical personnel, has been insufficient in the process of health policy formulation. The study suggests that the decision-making process in health policy needs to be more participatory and reliable, with governance regarded as a high priority.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Evaluation of Health Policy Governance in the Introduction of the New DRG-Based Hospital Payment System from Interviews with Policy Elites in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location>. <em><org>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</org></em>, 2020,17(3757):3757.
