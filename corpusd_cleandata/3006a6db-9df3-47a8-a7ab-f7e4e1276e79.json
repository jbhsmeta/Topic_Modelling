    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily India\nReport -- Data detailed on Materials Research have been presented. According\nto news reporting out of Kerala, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated,\n\"Magnesium and its alloys are suitable candidates for developing biodegradable\nmetallic implants. However, the rapid degradation of these alloys in the\nphysiological environment is a major limitation for such applications.\"\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the National\nInstitute of Technology Calicut, \"In this work, Mg-Ca alloy was chemically\ntreated with acetic acid and its effects on degradation behaviour were studied\nusing simulated body fluid (SBF). The surface morphology and composition of\nthe acid pickled samples were investigated using a scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The degradation rate was\nanalysed by conducting potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and immersion tests.\nThe results show that optimum acetic acid treatment improved the corrosion\nresistance by acid etching and formation of magnesium acetate layer. The\ntreated samples also exhibited enhanced biomineralization and developed\ncalcium phosphate layer on the surfaces during immersion tests.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It is proposed that\nacetic acid pickling can be used as a reliable technique for surface\nmodification as well as for pre-treatment of magnesium alloys to make them\nsuitable for degradable metallic implant applications.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Tailoring biomineralization and\nbiodegradation of Mg-Ca alloy by acetic acid pickling. _Materials Research\nExpress_ , 2020;7(5):054002. _Materials Research Express_ can be contacted at:\nIop Publishing Ltd, Temple Circus, Temple Way, Bristol BS1 6BE, England.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting T. Hanas, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Dept. of\nMechanical Engineering, Calicut 673601, Kerala, India. Additional authors for\nthis research include S.A. Rahim and M.A. Joseph.\n\nThe direct object identifier (DOI) for that additional information is:\n<https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab8d5f>.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at Daily India Report -- Data detailed on <org>Materials Research</org> have been presented. According to news reporting out of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.kl\">Kerala, India</location>, by NewsRx editors, research stated, &#8220;Magnesium and its alloys are suitable candidates for developing biodegradable metallic implants. However, the rapid degradation of these alloys in the physiological environment is a major limitation for such applications.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the <org>National Institute of Technology Calicut</org>, &#8220;In this work, Mg-Ca alloy was chemically treated with acetic acid and its effects on degradation behaviour were studied using simulated body fluid (SBF). The surface morphology and composition of the acid pickled samples were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The degradation rate was analysed by conducting potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and immersion tests. The results show that optimum acetic acid treatment improved the corrosion resistance by acid etching and formation of magnesium acetate layer. The treated samples also exhibited enhanced biomineralization and developed calcium phosphate layer on the surfaces during immersion tests.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;It is proposed that acetic acid pickling can be used as a reliable technique for surface modification as well as for pre-treatment of magnesium alloys to make them suitable for degradable metallic implant applications.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Tailoring biomineralization and biodegradation of Mg-Ca alloy by acetic acid pickling. <em>Materials Research Express</em>, 2020;7(5):054002. <em>Materials Research Express</em> can be contacted at: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0832757723\">Iop Publishing Ltd</org>, <org>Temple Circus</org>, <location>Temple Way</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.bristl\">Bristol</location> BS1 6BE, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.eng\">England</location>.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>T.
