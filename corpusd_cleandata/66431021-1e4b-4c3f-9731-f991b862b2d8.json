    "text": "Over Memorial Day weekend, hundreds of runners participated in the annual Run\nof Remembrance typically hosted in American Fork, although many of the runners\nnever stepped foot on the course.\n\nLike many races since the coronavirus pandemic began, the Run of Remembrance\nwas held virtually this year, allowing for the over 2,000 runners that\nregistered for the race to participate in the one-mile run, 5K or 10K runs on\ntheir own.\n\n\"When the governor changed things from orange to yellow in Utah County, we\nwere pretty excited and thinking OK, maybe this is enough to make the race\npossible,\" said David Wylie, event operations manager for Runtastic Events.\nRuntastic Events is an organization based in American Fork that puts on the\nRun of Remembrance and 10 races in other locations each year, ranging from\none-mile runs and kid runs to full marathons. \"But, everyone involved felt\nthat it was too soon to really host something that could potentially be have\n1000, 1500 or even 2000 people, especially with all these other races\ncanceling,\" explained Wylie.\n\n\"Obviously, it's impacting the running community because they look forward to\nthese events,\" said Wylie. \"They train for these events and seeing them cancel\njust kind of is just another blow on top of all this stuff that's going on.\"\n\nWith the Run of Remembrance being a free race with early registration, Wylie\nexplained that the move to a virtual race fortunately hasn't had too severe of\nan impact on Runtastic Events \u0096 aside from the company having a stock of\nroughly 700 t-shirts that typically sell out, but likely won't do so this\nyear. Nevertheless, races getting cancelled have a broader impact than many\nmight anticipate. To orchestrate a race, it takes a lot of permits and\ncollaborating with various groups and organizations \u0096 like those that provide\nbarricades and porta-potties.\n\n\"So now the barricade company didn't have income from this race, the porta-\npotty company didn't have income from this race,\" said Wylie. \"Yes, we're the\nupfront ones, but the impact is definitely spread out among various groups and\nareas.\"\n\nAlthough the Run of Remembrance was not able to be held officially \u0096 meaning\nno group start, no crowds to cheer runners on, no aid stations along the\ncourse, no runners behind or in front to motivate personal-record efforts, or\nmedals at the finish line \u0096 the virtual race still allowed for a wide spectrum\nof participation and also some race-day validation.\n\n\"People can run it anywhere; We've had someone from New York that signed up\nand bought a shirt,\" said Wylie. \"People can run any distance, we've just made\nsure that we are providing the opportunity for them to run the official course\nunofficially so that they can maybe try to simulate a similar race experience\nfor themselves.\"\n\nOne runner who opted to run the official course unofficially was Nathan\nGarner, a Taylorsville resident who grew up in American Fork.\n\n\"It's good to have something to do, and something to come out and train for,\"\nexplained Garner after finishing the 5K course and cooling down at Robinson\nPark. Despite the course not having its usual signage to direct runners, there\nwere still arrows spray-painted to show runners the way, and Garner felt the\nrun was still pretty seamless.\n\nHaving run four virtual races before the Run of Remembrance, Garner has been\ngetting used to racing amid COVID-19. \"I think it's an interesting time,\" said\nGarner. \"Some people are getting into it more so now simply because there's\nnothing else to do. I've seen people who have started running who have never\nrun before.\"\n\nHowever, Garner did admit that his time wasn't as fast as it would've been\nduring a typical location race. He missed the spirited atmosphere of running\namong people, but was glad to be able to feed his competitive nature by\ncomparing times virtually.\n\nWylie explained, \"We encourage people to use Strava and other different\nrunning apps that they can track, and they're welcome to submit their times\nonline.\" However, with no timing chips or way to vet times, and people\nchoosing to run routes besides the unofficial courses in American Fork, the\nrace had no official winners or prizes. \"Runners are doing it for their own\nenjoyment and their own purposes,\" said Wylie.\n\nWith the race being titled the Run of Remembrance and being typically held on\nMemorial Day, a general purpose to many of those running the race is to honor\nmembers of the military who have perished defending the freedoms guaranteed by\nthe United State of America.\n\n\"We ran it in remembrance of obviously Memorial Day, but also of both our\nkids' grandparents, who were World War II veterans,\" said Rhandi Orme, a\nKaysville resident that ran her own 5K route near her home, with her husband\nand children joining in during the last mile. One fought in the Battle of the\nBulge, and received a Purple Heart after being injured, while the other served\na less combat-oriented role in Brazil.\n\nA self-proclaimed running junkie, Orme is an athletic coach and has run\nseveral ultra-marathons as well as the Boston Marathon a few times. She is\ncurrently training to run 100 miles in a single day. \"I love what running adds\nto my life,\" said Orme. \"I feel like it makes me a better mom and a better\nperson because it's a great way for me to enjoy nature, relieve stress and\nmany other things. It's been a great piece of solace for me because running is\nsomething we can still safely and regularly do while there are so many regular\nthings that we can't do.\"\n\nOrme, too, has run several virtual races since COVID-19 began its rapid\nspread, and has been thankful to be able to connect virtually with fellow\nrunners when physical races aren't allowed due to restrictions.\n\n\"I definitely miss the running community,\" said Orme. \"It's been a hard couple\nof months to not be able to run with friends, but in the grand scheme of\nthings, that's a very small sacrifice to make in order to keep people safe.\"\n\nGoing forward, it's uncertain when in-person location races will be feasible\nagain, but in the meantime, virtual races are helping bridge the gap between\nrunners and race companies like Runtastic Events, and they may also expand the\npossibilities of running races.\n\n\"There's kind of been this big change and those who are doing it, I think, are\nseeing some success, but it's still sad to see all these different races,\nlarge races, small races getting canceled and delayed till next year,\"\nexplained Wylie.\n\nHowever, after seeing the success of a \"Conquer Covid-19 Virtual Run\"\nRuntastic held, Wylie believes that virtual races can grow the running\ncommunity. \"We had about 30% participants in Utah and 70% across the United\nStates, so it allows us to reach new and different audiences than location\nraces,\" said Wylie. Virtual challenges, such as running a certain distance\nover a period of time, are also popular running community fruits borne of the\ndigitally-savvy side of running that Runtastic looks forward to continue\nimplementing.\n\nBoth the Heber Half Run for Autism and Timpanogos Half races are upcoming\nevents for Runtastic, and they plan to do everything they can to make the in-\nperson location races happen, but are also monitoring expert health\nrecommendations. \"As things move forward, we'll look at contingency plans if\nthings aren't improving,\" said Wylie.\n\nFor the time being, virtual races are the new norm.\n\n\"We're going to keep going even after the COVID stuff is over and things are\nreopened,\" said Wylie. \"We'll be having virtual races in addition to our\nlocation races going forward. Whenever we can hold our first location race\nagain, it's going to give people that hope again that things are really going\nto go back to normal.\"",

    "html": "<p>Over <chron>Memorial Day</chron> weekend, hundreds of runners participated in the annual Run of Remembrance typically hosted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.ameork\">American Fork</location>, although many of the runners never stepped foot on the course.</p>\n<p>Like many races since the coronavirus pandemic began, the Run of Remembrance was held virtually this year, allowing for the over 2,000 runners that registered for the race to participate in the one-mile run, 5K or 10K runs on their own.</p>\n\n<p>\"When the governor changed things from orange to yellow in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.utanty\">Utah County</location>, we were pretty excited and thinking OK, maybe this is enough to make the race possible,\" said <person>David Wylie</person>, event operations manager for Runtastic Events. Runtastic Events is an organization based in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.ameork\">American Fork</location> that puts on the Run of Remembrance and 10 races in other locations each year, ranging from one-mile runs and kid runs to full marathons. \"But, everyone involved felt that it was too soon to really host something that could potentially be have 1000, 1500 or even 2000 people, especially with all these other races canceling,\" explained Wylie.</p>\n\n<p>\"Obviously, it's impacting the running community because they look forward to these events,\" said Wylie. \"They train for these events and seeing them cancel just kind of is just another blow on top of all this stuff that's going on.\"</p>\n\n<p>With the Run of Remembrance being a free race with early registration, Wylie explained that the move to a virtual race fortunately hasn't had too severe of an impact on Runtastic Events &#150; aside from the company having a stock of roughly 700 t-shirts that typically sell out, but likely won't do so this year. Nevertheless, races getting cancelled have a broader impact than many might anticipate. To orchestrate a race, it takes a lot of permits and collaborating with various groups and organizations &#150; like those that provide barricades and porta-potties.</p>\n\n<p>\"So now the barricade company didn't have income from this race, the porta-potty company didn't have income from this race,\" said Wylie. \"Yes, we're the upfront ones, but the impact is definitely spread out among various groups and areas.\"</p>\n\n<p>Although the Run of Remembrance was not able to be held officially &#150; meaning no group start, no crowds to cheer runners on, no aid stations along the course, no runners behind or in front to motivate personal-record efforts, or medals at the finish line &#150; the virtual race still allowed for a wide spectrum of participation and also some race-day validation.</p>\n\n<p>\"People can run it anywhere; We've had someone from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location> that signed up and bought a shirt,\" said Wylie. \"People can run any distance, we've just made sure that we are providing the opportunity for them to run the official course unofficially so that they can maybe try to simulate a similar race experience for themselves.\"</p>\n\n<p>One runner who opted to run the official course unofficially was <person>Nathan Garner</person>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.taylle\">Taylorsville</location> resident who grew up in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.ameork\">American Fork</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's good to have something to do, and something to come out and train for,\" explained Garner after finishing the 5K course and cooling down at <location>Robinson Park</location>. Despite the course not having its usual signage to direct runners, there were still arrows spray-painted to show runners the way, and Garner felt the run was still pretty seamless.</p>\n\n<p>Having run four virtual races before the Run of Remembrance, Garner has been getting used to racing amid COVID-19. \"I think it's an interesting time,\" said Garner. \"Some people are getting into it more so now simply because there's nothing else to do. I've seen people who have started running who have never run before.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, Garner did admit that his time wasn't as fast as it would've been during a typical location race. He missed the spirited atmosphere of running among people, but was glad to be able to feed his competitive nature by comparing times virtually.</p>\n\n<p>Wylie explained, \"We encourage people to use Strava and other different running apps that they can track, and they're welcome to submit their times online.\" However, with no timing chips or way to vet times, and people choosing to run routes besides the unofficial courses in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.ameork\">American Fork</location>, the race had no official winners or prizes. \"Runners are doing it for their own enjoyment and their own purposes,\" said Wylie.</p>\n\n<p>With the race being titled the Run of Remembrance and being typically held on <chron>Memorial Day</chron>, a general purpose to many of those running the race is to honor members of the military who have perished defending the freedoms guaranteed by the United State of America.</p>\n\n<p>\"We ran it in remembrance of obviously <chron>Memorial Day</chron>, but also of both our kids' grandparents, who were World War II veterans,\" said <person>Rhandi Orme</person>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ut.kaylle\">Kaysville</location> resident that ran her own 5K route near her home, with her husband and children joining in during the last mile. One fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and received a Purple Heart after being injured, while the other served a less combat-oriented role in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>.</p>\n\n<p>A self-proclaimed running junkie, Orme is an athletic coach and has run several ultra-marathons as well as the <org>Boston Marathon</org> a few times. She is currently training to run 100 miles in a single day. \"I love what running adds to my life,\" said Orme. \"I feel like it makes me a better mom and a better person because it's a great way for me to enjoy nature, relieve stress and many other things. It's been a great piece of solace for me because running is something we can still safely and regularly do while there are so many regular things that we can't do.\"</p>\n\n<p>Orme, too, has run several virtual races since COVID-19 began its rapid spread, and has been thankful to be able to connect virtually with fellow runners when physical races aren't allowed due to restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>\"I definitely miss the running community,\" said Orme. \"It's been a hard couple of months to not be able to run with friends, but in the grand scheme of things, that's a very small sacrifice to make in order to keep people safe.\"</p>\n\n<p>Going forward, it's uncertain when in-person location races will be feasible again, but in the meantime, virtual races are helping bridge the gap between runners and race companies like Runtastic Events, and they may also expand the possibilities of running races.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's kind of been this big change and those who are doing it, I think, are seeing some success, but it's still sad to see all these different races, large races, small races getting canceled and delayed till next year,\" explained Wylie.</p>\n\n<p>However, after seeing the success of a \"Conquer Covid-19 Virtual Run\" Runtastic held, Wylie believes that virtual races can grow the running community. \"We had about 30% participants in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ut\">Utah</location> and 70% across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, so it allows us to reach new and different audiences than location races,\" said Wylie. Virtual challenges, such as running a certain distance over a period of time, are also popular running community fruits borne of the digitally-savvy side of running that Runtastic looks forward to continue implementing.</p>\n\n<p>Both the Heber Half Run for Autism and Timpanogos Half races are upcoming events for Runtastic, and they plan to do everything they can to make the in-person location races happen, but are also monitoring expert health recommendations. \"As things move forward, we'll look at contingency plans if things aren't improving,\" said Wylie.</p>\n\n<p>For the time being, virtual races are the new norm.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're going to keep going even after the COVID stuff is over and things are reopened,\" said Wylie. \"We'll be having virtual races in addition to our location races going forward. Whenever we can hold our first location race again, it's going to give people that hope again that things are really going to go back to normal.\"</p>",
