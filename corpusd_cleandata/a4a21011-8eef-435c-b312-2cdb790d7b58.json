Just 523 U.S. health care organizations out of more than 6,300\nU.S. hospitals have achieved Magnet recognition.\n\n\"Magnet recognition provides our community with the ultimate benchmark to\nmeasure the quality of patient care,\" said Beth Bartlett, vice president of\nSt. Francis Patient Care Services. \"Achieving Magnet recognition reinforces\nthe culture of excellence that is a cornerstone of how we serve our community.\nIt's also tangible evidence of our nurses' commitment to providing the very\nbest care to our patients, of which we are extremely proud.\"\n\nResearch demonstrates that Magnet recognition provides specific benefits to\nhealth care organizations and their communities, such as Lower risk of 30-day\nmortality and lower failure-to-rescue rates.\n\nTo achieve Magnet recognition, organizations must pass a rigorous and lengthy\nprocess that includes an electronic application, written patient care\ndocumentation, an on-site visit and a review by the Commission on Magnet\nRecognition.\n\nMary Lanning honored by safety council for 21st year in a row\n\nHASTINGS - Mary Lanning Healthcare in Hastings recently was honored for\nexceptional performance with the Platinum Award from the National Safety\nCouncil, Greater Omaha Chapter.\n\nFor the past 21 years, Mary Lanning has maintained above-standard performance\nin the number of work-related injuries and has implemented effective\nstrategies to prevent injuries, according to the council.\n\n\"Our tradition of excellence in the area of safety is due to the dedication\nand commitment shown by everyone within the hospital family,\" said Karee\nDvorak, facilities compliance manager.\n\nThe National Safety Council, Greater Omaha Chapter, is a nonprofit\norganization that provides programs in occupational safety, community safety,\ntraffic safety, behind-the-wheel driver education and personal accountability\nof individual behavior choices that impact safety.",
