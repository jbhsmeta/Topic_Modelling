    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) \u0096 A popular charter school in downtown Oklahoma City is\nworking to raise money to complete a series of renovations at a historic\ncenter.\n\nJohn Rex Charter School announced that it has launched a capital campaign to\ncomplete renovations of the historic McAlpine Center.\n\nThe center will be transformed into a new learning space for the growing\nstudent body.\n\nOrganizers say they plan to raise $400,000 by August 1 in order to complete\nthe project. So far, the school has already received $825,000 from a federal\ngrant, support from the Inasmuch Foundation, and donations from the John Rex\nfamily.\n\n\"We're bursting at the seams, and we need more space to accommodate the influx\nof students in downtown Oklahoma City,\" said Heather Zacarias, interim\nsuperintendent and director of elementary education. \"Rather than constructing\na brand-new building, we're refurbishing an older facility to help improve our\ncommunity. Long-time donors have already helped us get to this point, and\nwe're calling on our neighbors, partners and school community to help get us\nover the finish line.\"\n\nIn addition to primarily serving fifth through eighth grade students,\norganizers say the McAlpine Center will benefit all grade levels with art and\nmusic classes.\n\n\"We continue to support downtown Oklahoma City's growing population and\nprovide a quality education to children of all backgrounds, which we believe\nshould involve studying the arts and music,\" Zacarias said. \"Families are\nmoving downtown because of the opportunities at John Rex, and the McAlpine\nCenter will allow us to instill a love of learning in even more children.\"",

So far, the school has already received <money>$825,000</money> from a federal grant, support from the <org>Inasmuch Foundation</org>, and donations from the John Rex family.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're bursting at the seams, and we need more space to accommodate the influx of students in downtown <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.oklcty\">Oklahoma City</location>,\" said <person>Heather Zacarias</person>, interim superintendent and director of elementary education. \"Rather than constructing a brand-new building, we're refurbishing an older facility to help improve our community. Long-time donors have already helped us get to this point, and we're calling on our neighbors, partners and school community to help get us over the finish line.\"</p>\n\n<p>In addition to primarily serving fifth through eighth grade students, organizers say the McAlpine Center will benefit all grade levels with art and music classes.</p>\n\n<p>\"We continue to support downtown <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.oklcty\">Oklahoma City's</location> growing population and provide a quality education to children of all backgrounds, which we believe should involve studying the arts and music,\" Zacarias said. \"Families are moving downtown because of the opportunities at John Rex, and the McAlpine Center will allow us to instill a love of learning in even more children.\"</p>",
