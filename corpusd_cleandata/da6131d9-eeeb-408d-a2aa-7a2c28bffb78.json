    "text": "Scott Beck's blog post (2020) is the inspiration for this month's column and\nthe Teacher Librarian poster (see pages 32-33). Beck is the director of\nStudent Services for Secondary School for Norman Public Schools in Norman,\nOklahoma. In Most Likely to Succeed, Dintersmith and Wagner (as cited in Beck,\n2020) provide a list of skills that \"students--and educators--will continue to\nneed as they progress forward in their personal, civic, and professional\nlives.\" These include:\n\n* Critical thinking and problem-solving\n\n* Collaboration across networks\n\n* Agility and adaptability\n\n* Initiative and entrepreneurship\n\n* Effective oral, written, and multimedia communication\n\n* Accessing and analyzing information\n\n* Curiosity and imagination\n\nAll of the above are skills taught, supported, and promoted by school\nlibrarians and accomplished in an information-rich setting--the library--with\nthe unique abilities of a certified librarian. The school librarian provides\nequitable access to information in all formats within the context of teaching\ninformation literacy skills. This, in turn, prepares students to be capable\nlearners, users of information, and communicators for life.\n\nBeck's insight provides inspiration for the creation of the top 11+ reasons\nschools need school librarians. The list was created to reflect how librarians\nfulfill each role in a distinctive way, differentiating them from other\neducators and capturing their unique expertise. School librarians are needed\nbecause they:\n\n1\\. Advocate for inquiry, critical thinking, and problem-solving\n\n2\\. Curate print, virtual, and multimedia resources\n\n3\\. Link resources to literary and learning needs\n\n4\\. Model collaboration with teachers & students\n\n5\\. Teach information literacy to access, analyze, and apply\n\n6\\. Embrace curiosity and welcome change\n\n7\\. Create safe, welcoming spaces\n\n8\\. Herald the tenets of information citizenship\n\n9\\. Specialize in student choice & voice\n\n10\\. Put the \"make\" in makerspace.\n\n11\\. Enable online learnng and access 24/7. (see pages 32-33)\n\nBeck (2020) challenges all educators to,\n\n    \n    \n    Take a moment to sit down with your\n       teacher librarian to dream together\n       and to chart a course. Unlock the\n       power of your library to drive a culture\n       of deep learning in your school,\n       and always remember, school is not\n       preparation for real life, school is real\n       life. At least, it should be--and your\n       school librarians can help with that.\n\nThis is a call to school librarians to embody what Beck describes as the\nnonnegotiable role of school librarians, which are reflected in the Teacher\nLibrarian poster. Remember: One of the strongest elements of school library\nadvocacy is when \"others will act for and with you\" (AASL, 2007), so recruit\nyour advocacy stakeholders to use and share the poster as they support you and\nthe school library.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAmerican Association of School Librarians (AASL).

    "html": "<p><person>Scott Beck's</person> blog post (2020) is the inspiration for this\nmonth's column and the Teacher Librarian poster (see pages 32-33).\nBeck is the director of Student Services for <org>Secondary School for Norman\nPublic Schools</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.norman\">Norman, Oklahoma</location>. In Most Likely to Succeed,\nDintersmith and Wagner (as cited in Beck, 2020) provide a list of skills\nthat \"students--and educators--will continue to need as they\nprogress forward in their personal, civic, and professional lives.\"\nThese include:</p>\n\n<p>* Critical thinking and problem-solving</p>\n\n<p>* Collaboration across networks</p>\n\n<p>* Agility and adaptability</p>\n\n<p>* Initiative and entrepreneurship</p>\n\n<p>* Effective oral, written, and multimedia communication</p>\n\n<p>* Accessing and analyzing information</p>\n\n<p>* Curiosity and imagination</p>\n\n<p>All of the above are skills taught, supported, and promoted by\nschool librarians and accomplished in an information-rich setting--the\nlibrary--with the unique abilities of a certified librarian. The school\nlibrarian provides equitable access to information in all formats within\nthe context of teaching information literacy skills. This, in turn,\nprepares students to be capable learners, users of information, and\ncommunicators for life.</p>\n\n<p>Beck's insight provides inspiration for the creation of the\ntop 11+ reasons schools need school librarians. The list was created to\nreflect how librarians fulfill each role in a distinctive way,\ndifferentiating them from other educators and capturing their unique\nexpertise. School librarians are needed because they:</p>\n\n<p>1. Advocate for inquiry, critical thinking, and problem-solving</p>\n\n<p>2. Curate print, virtual, and multimedia resources</p>\n\n<p>3. Link resources to literary and learning needs</p>\n\n<p>4. Model collaboration with teachers &amp; students</p>\n\n<p>5. Teach information literacy to access, analyze, and apply</p>\n\n<p>6. Embrace curiosity and welcome change</p>\n\n<p>7. Create safe, welcoming spaces</p>\n\n<p>8. Herald the tenets of information citizenship</p>\n\n<p>9. Specialize in student choice &amp; voice</p>\n\n<p>10. Put the \"make\" in makerspace.</p>\n\n<p>11. Enable online learnng and access 24/7. (see pages 32-33)</p>\n\n<p>Beck (2020) challenges all educators to,</p>\n\n<pre>Take a moment to sit down with your\n   teacher librarian to dream together\n   and to chart a course. Unlock the\n   power of your library to drive a culture\n   of deep learning in your school,\n   and always remember, school is not\n   preparation for real life, school is real\n   life. At least, it should be--and your\n   school librarians can help with that.</pre>\n\n<p>This is a call to school librarians to embody what Beck describes\nas the nonnegotiable role of school librarians, which are reflected in\nthe Teacher Librarian poster. Remember: One of the strongest elements of\nschool library advocacy is when \"others will act for and with\nyou\" (AASL, 2007), so recruit your advocacy stakeholders to use and\nshare the poster as they support you and the school library.</p>\n\n<p>REFERENCES</p>\n\n<p><org>American Association of School Librarians</org> (AASL).
