    "text": "CHEYENNE \\- The Tax Reform 2000 report will soon be getting the full attention\nit deserved but didn't receive when it was published more than two decades\nago.\n\nThe Legislature's Joint Revenue Committee last week made plans for a full-\nscale discussion of the report - a \"deep dive\" - at a later meeting this\nsummer.\n\nThe committee chairs, Sen. Cale Case of Lander, and Rep. Dan Zwonitzer of\nCheyenne, intend to invite some of the major players involved in that report.\n\nThe list includes former Gov. Jim Geringer, along with former senators John\nHines of Gillette and Dan Sullivan of Casper, among others.\n\nThe plan is to hold a two-day session outside the normal interim schedule\ndevoted to the study, including the circumstances that prompted it and the\nfinal recommendations.\n\nThe reform report is most noted for its recommendation that the state adopt an\nincome tax.\n\nThat recommendation alone was enough to insure a ton of opposition.\n\nAs a result, the report was set aside on a shelf somewhere alongside a large\nnumber of other abandoned government studies.\n\nWhat helped make it irrelevant was the coal methane boom which started in\n2001, as Zwonitzer noted during the committee meeting last week.\n\nThe 1997 Legislature authorized the tax reform task force at a time when the\nstate was facing a budget deficit of nearly $200 million.\n\nOne of the opponents to the income tax recommendation was former Gov. Jim\nGeringer, who had appointed the task force members.\n\nA report from a Cheyenne broadcaster said Geringer replied \"hell no\" when\nasked if he would support the income tax recommendation.\n\nIt also was opposed by former House Speaker Nels Smith of Sundance. In 1973,\nSmith was the sponsor of the constitutional amendment that allows residents to\nreceive credit for other taxes they pay if the state ever adopts an income\ntax.\n\nThe tax reform report said that even with the amendment's restrictions, the\nincome tax would raise an estimated $153 million per year.\n\nSmith called the amendment, which voters endorsed enthusiastically,\n\"preventive medicine\" in a telephone interview several years ago.\n\nIf the state ever adopted an income tax, he said, it would be a desperate move\ntriggered by a real crisis.\n\nThat was prophetic.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nThe $200 million deficit that prompted the tax reform study was a mere\npittance compared to the state's current revenue shortfall that is creeping\ninto the billions.\n\nThe task force made two other recommendations - broadening the state sales tax\nand passing a real estate transfer tax.\n\nThe task force wanted to extend the sales tax to services used mostly by\nhigher income families.\n\nThe revenue committee is also looking at a sales tax increase, expansion or\nboth.\n\nAnother item for the next agenda is a proposal from Rep. Tim Hallinan,\nR-Gillette, to bond for $500 million to weather the financial hit from the\ncoronavirus pandemic and mineral revenues problems, which he believes are\nlikely to be resolved in four to five years.\n\nWith the current climate of low interest rates, the state might get the money\nfor 1 percent interest, he said.\n\n\"I think that's the ideal solution to our problem.\"\n\nHallinan's plan would do nothing to solve Wyoming's decades-old financial\nstructural problem, which was the core reason for the tax reform report.\n\nBut it could tide the state over until some serious tax changes would go into\neffect.\n\nIn any case, at least the 2000 tax reform report - the product of 18-plus\nmonths of work - will get read.\n\nPhil Noble, a former Cheyenne businessman and state agency head, was vice\nchairman of the tax reform task force.\n\n\"The only option in Wyoming for longtime growth is an income tax - corporate\nand personal,\" Noble said during an interview four years ago. \"Otherwise we're\nnot going to have enough money for services - ever.\"\n\nThe reason Wyoming will never prosper without an income tax is because the\nstate is too small to attract major businesses, he added.\n\nAs the tired old joke said, \"We tried to diversify but Toyota never came.\"",

    "title": "Barron: Tax reform report to get 'deep dive' study",
    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.cheyen\">CHEYENNE</location> - The Tax Reform 2000 report will soon be getting the full attention it deserved but didn't receive when it was published more than two decades ago.</p>\n<p><org>The Legislature's</org> <org>Joint Revenue Committee</org> last week made plans for a full-scale discussion of the report - a \"deep dive\" - at a later meeting this summer.</p>\n\n<p>The committee chairs, Sen. <person>Cale Case</person> of Lander, and Rep. <person>Dan Zwonitzer</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.cheyen\">Cheyenne</location>, intend to invite some of the major players involved in that report.</p>\n\n<p>The list includes former Gov. <person>Jim Geringer</person>, along with former senators <person>John Hines</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.giltte\">Gillette</location> and <person>Dan Sullivan</person> of Casper, among others.</p>\n\n<p>The plan is to hold a two-day session outside the normal interim schedule devoted to the study, including the circumstances that prompted it and the final recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>The reform report is most noted for its recommendation that the state adopt an income tax.</p>\n\n<p>That recommendation alone was enough to insure a ton of opposition.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the report was set aside on a shelf somewhere alongside a large number of other abandoned government studies.</p>\n\n<p>What helped make it irrelevant was the coal methane boom which started in 2001, as Zwonitzer noted during the committee meeting last week.</p>\n\n<p>The 1997 Legislature authorized the tax reform task force at a time when the state was facing a budget deficit of nearly <money>$200 million</money>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the opponents to the income tax recommendation was former Gov. <person>Jim Geringer</person>, who had appointed the task force members.</p>\n\n<p>A report from a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.cheyen\">Cheyenne</location> broadcaster said Geringer replied \"hell no\" when asked if he would support the income tax recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>It also was opposed by former House Speaker <person>Nels Smith</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.sunnce\">Sundance</location>. In 1973, Smith was the sponsor of the constitutional amendment that allows residents to receive credit for other taxes they pay if the state ever adopts an income tax.</p>\n\n<p>The tax reform report said that even with the amendment's restrictions, the income tax would raise an estimated <money>$153 million</money> per year.</p>\n\n<p>Smith called the amendment, which voters endorsed enthusiastically, \"preventive medicine\" in a telephone interview several years ago.</p>\n\n<p>If the state ever adopted an income tax, he said, it would be a desperate move triggered by a real crisis.</p>\n\n<p>That was prophetic.</p>\n\n<p>So here we are.</p>\n\n<p>The <money>$200 million</money> deficit that prompted the tax reform study was a mere pittance compared to the state's current revenue shortfall that is creeping into the billions.</p>\n\n<p>The task force made two other recommendations - broadening the state sales tax and passing a real estate transfer tax.</p>\n\n<p>The task force wanted to extend the sales tax to services used mostly by higher income families.</p>\n\n<p>The revenue committee is also looking at a sales tax increase, expansion or both.</p>\n\n<p>Another item for the next agenda is a proposal from Rep. <person>Tim Hallinan</person>, R-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.giltte\">Gillette</location>, to bond for <money>$500 million</money> to weather the financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic and mineral revenues problems, which he believes are likely to be resolved in four to five years.</p>\n\n<p>With the current climate of low interest rates, the state might get the money for 1 percent interest, he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think that's the ideal solution to our problem.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hallinan's plan would do nothing to solve <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wy\">Wyoming's</location> decades-old financial structural problem, which was the core reason for the tax reform report.</p>\n\n<p>But it could tide the state over until some serious tax changes would go into effect.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, at least the 2000 tax reform report - the product of 18-plus months of work - will get read.</p>\n\n<p><person>Phil Noble</person>, a former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wy.cheyen\">Cheyenne</location> businessman and state agency head, was vice chairman of the tax reform task force.</p>\n\n<p>\"The only option in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wy\">Wyoming</location> for longtime growth is an income tax - corporate and personal,\" Noble said during an interview four years ago. \"Otherwise we're not going to have enough money for services - ever.\"</p>\n\n<p>The reason <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wy\">Wyoming</location> will never prosper without an income tax is because the state is too small to attract major businesses, he added.</p>\n\n<p>As the tired old joke said, \"We tried to diversify but <org>Toyota</org> never came.\"</p>",
