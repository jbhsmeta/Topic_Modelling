    "text": "Demonstrators gathered in downtown Columbia Sunday, adding to protests that\ntook place in Springfield and Boonville, with no immediate reports of\nviolence.\n\nThe Missouri cities joined dozens around the country where protests were held\nover the death Monday of Floyd, who was black and handcuffed when a white\nMinneapolis police officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground\nduring an arrest as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. The\nofficer, Derek Chauvin, and three others who took part in the arrest were\nfired, and Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and\nmanslaughter. The other three officers haven't been charged.\n\nThose at the front of Sunday's demonstration in downtown Columbia declined to\ngive their names.\n\n\"George Floyd,\" one said.\n\n\"Breonna Taylor,\" said another.\n\nThe event was organized Sunday morning in the span of about four or five\nhours. A couple hundred residents met in downtown Columbia, marching down\nNinth Street, Broadway and later heading south on College Avenue.\n\nMarchers chanted, \"No justice, no peace, prosecute the police!\"\n\nSydney Brooks was sitting in a car following the protesters, offering them\nwater as they went. She's a college student.\n\n\"We have a statue of Thomas Jefferson,\" she said. Jefferson was a slave owner,\nand his statue is located on the University of Missouri quadrangle. \"How do we\nhave peace for that? There's no peace for that.\"\n\nConfederate statues have been vandalized in many cities amid protests.\n\nThere was no police presence at Sunday's event. Several passing vehicles\nhonked in support.\n\nKansas City officials imposed a partial curfew and pleaded for calm on Sunday\nafter overnight protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and law\nenforcement's treatment of blacks devolved into violence that left several\nbusinesses damaged and at least 10 people injured.\n\nMayor Quinton Lucas said the curfew would last from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m.\nMonday for city parks, downtown, the Westport entertainment district and the\nCounty Club Plaza, where officers responded with tear gas Saturday night after\nprotesters smashed windows, burned a police car and threw rocks and bottles at\npolice. People will be subject to arrest if they violate the curfew, which has\nnot been extended beyond Monday morning.\n\nMore than 1,000 people participated in Saturday's protest and hundreds more,\nincluding U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, gathered Sunday afternoon for\nanother protest.\n\nLucas and Police Chief Rick Smith vowed to protect peaceful participants, but\nthey said local police, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Missouri\nNational Guard would be on hand to try to prevent further violence.\n\n\"Peaceful demonstration is not breaking a bunch of windows at a cupcake shop,\nor raiding through a Gucci store,\" Lucas said, adding that he had talked to a\nblack businessman who was among owners trying to assess damage to their\nbusinesses on Sunday. \"That's not what this is about. What this is about is\nmaking sure we can find justice and finding a way to build justice in our\ncommunity.\"\n\nPolice arrested 85 people and at least 10 people were injured, including two\nofficers who remained hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries Sunday.\nSmith said every officer on the front lines during the violence was struck by\nsome type of object. A spokesperson for the city's municipal court said 22\ncitations involving 19 people were issued between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. Sunday\nnear the Country Club Plaza.\n\nOluwatoyin Keji Akinmoladun, 22, of Grandview, an organizer of the protests,\nsaid she urged people in the crowds to remain peaceful Saturday but some\nprotesters began throwing objects when police began using tear gas. She also\nclaimed police arrested people who weren't throwing objects, including a man\nplaying a trumpet and another person who was not part of the protest.\n\n\"I blame police for the damage,\" she said. \"No one wants to damage Kansas\nCity, damage a beautiful spot like the Country Club Plaza. But (police) cared\na lot more about the Plaza than they do about black people. They didn't want\nto let us have our First Amendment rights, just worried about getting us off\nthe street. I really wanted a peaceful protest but I can't control everyone.\"\n\nPolice spokesman Sgt. Jake Becchina said flash bangs were used, but he could\nnot confirm reports from some protesters that rubber bullets also were used.\n\nGov. Mike Parson called up the National Guard on Saturday to respond to\nviolence throughout the state, if needed. Smith said he asked for National\nGuard troops for Kansas City to help officers who are stretched thin by the\nprotests.\n\nViolence also erupted overnight Saturday in Ferguson, the St. Louis suburb\nthat's name has been synonymous with the police treatment of blacks since the\n2014 fatal shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police\nofficer. Seven officers were injured after being hit with rocks, bottles or\nfireworks and at least 11 police and fire vehicles were damaged, as was the\nFerguson police headquarters and many businesses, said Sgt. Benjamin Granda of\nthe St. Louis County police department.\n\nA \"significant amount\" of gunfire was heard in the area of the protests\nthroughout the night, but no arrests were made, Granda said.\n\nAkinmoladun said many black residents believe Kansas City police wrongfully\nshot and killed three black men in recent months and they want such shootings\nto end.\n\n\"We want (police) to understand that we will keep protesting,\" she said. \"We\nare here and we are watching and if these shootings continue, we will be\nback.\"\n\nThe Tribune's Anna Brugmann contributed to this report.",

    "html": "<p>Demonstrators gathered in downtown <person>Columbia Sunday</person>, adding to protests that took place in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.sprgfd\">Springfield</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.boolle\">Boonville</location>, with no immediate reports of violence.</p>\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mo\">Missouri</location> cities joined dozens around the country where protests were held over the death Monday of Floyd, who was black and handcuffed when a white <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground during an arrest as Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. The officer, <person>Derek Chauvin</person>, and three others who took part in the arrest were fired, and Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three officers haven't been charged.</p>\n\n<p>Those at the front of Sunday's demonstration in downtown Columbia declined to give their names.</p>\n\n<p>\"<person>George Floyd</person>,\" one said.</p>\n\n<p>\"<person>Breonna Taylor</person>,\" said another.</p>\n\n<p>The event was organized Sunday morning in the span of about four or five hours. A couple hundred residents met in downtown Columbia, marching down <location>Ninth Street</location>, <location>Broadway</location> and later heading south on <location>College Avenue</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Marchers chanted, \"No justice, no peace, prosecute the police!\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Sydney Brooks</person> was sitting in a car following the protesters, offering them water as they went. She's a college student.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have a statue of <person>Thomas Jefferson</person>,\" she said. Jefferson was a slave owner, and his statue is located on the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2711166225\">University of Missouri</org> quadrangle. \"How do we have peace for that? There's no peace for that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Confederate statues have been vandalized in many cities amid protests.</p>\n\n<p>There was no police presence at Sunday's event. Several passing vehicles honked in support.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.kancty\">Kansas City</location> officials imposed a partial curfew and pleaded for calm on Sunday after overnight protests over the death of <person>George Floyd</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> and law enforcement's treatment of blacks devolved into violence that left several businesses damaged and at least 10 people injured.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor <person>Quinton Lucas</person> said the curfew would last from <chron>8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday</chron> for city parks, downtown, the Westport entertainment district and the <org>County Club Plaza</org>, where officers responded with tear gas Saturday night after protesters smashed windows, burned a police car and threw rocks and bottles at police. People will be subject to arrest if they violate the curfew, which has not been extended beyond Monday morning.</p>\n\n<p>More than 1,000 people participated in Saturday's protest and hundreds more, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Rep. <person>Emanuel Cleaver</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mo\">Missouri</location>, gathered Sunday afternoon for another protest.</p>\n\n<p>Lucas and Police Chief <person>Rick Smith</person> vowed to protect peaceful participants, but they said local police, the <org>Missouri State Highway Patrol</org> and the <org>Missouri National Guard</org> would be on hand to try to prevent further violence.</p>\n\n<p>\"Peaceful demonstration is not breaking a bunch of windows at a cupcake shop, or raiding through a Gucci store,\" Lucas said, adding that he had talked to a black businessman who was among owners trying to assess damage to their businesses on Sunday. \"That's not what this is about. What this is about is making sure we can find justice and finding a way to build justice in our community.\"</p>\n\n<p>Police arrested 85 people and at least 10 people were injured, including two officers who remained hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries Sunday. Smith said every officer on the front lines during the violence was struck by some type of object. A spokesperson for the city's municipal court said 22 citations involving 19 people were issued <chron>between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. Sunday</chron> near the <org>Country Club Plaza</org>.</p>\n\n<p><person>Oluwatoyin Keji Akinmoladun</person>, 22, of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.graiew\">Grandview</location>, an organizer of the protests, said she urged people in the crowds to remain peaceful Saturday but some protesters began throwing objects when police began using tear gas. She also claimed police arrested people who weren't throwing objects, including a man playing a trumpet and another person who was not part of the protest.</p>\n\n<p>\"I blame police for the damage,\" she said. \"No one wants to damage <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.kancty\">Kansas City</location>, damage a beautiful spot like the <org>Country Club Plaza</org>. But (police) cared a lot more about the Plaza than they do about black people. They didn't want to let us have our First Amendment rights, just worried about getting us off the street. I really wanted a peaceful protest but I can't control everyone.\"</p>\n\n<p>Police spokesman Sgt. <person>Jake Becchina</person> said flash bangs were used, but he could not confirm reports from some protesters that rubber bullets also were used.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. <person>Mike Parson</person> called up the <org>National Guard</org> on Saturday to respond to violence throughout the state, if needed. Smith said he asked for <org>National Guard</org> troops for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.kancty\">Kansas City</location> to help officers who are stretched thin by the protests.</p>\n\n<p>Violence also erupted overnight Saturday in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.ferson\">Ferguson</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.stluis\">St. Louis</location> suburb that's name has been synonymous with the police treatment of blacks since the 2014 fatal shooting of a black teenager, <person>Michael Brown</person>, by a white police officer. Seven officers were injured after being hit with rocks, bottles or fireworks and at least 11 police and fire vehicles were damaged, as was the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.ferson\">Ferguson</location> police headquarters and many businesses, said Sgt. <person>Benjamin Granda</person> of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.stluis\">St. Louis County</location> police department.</p>\n\n<p>A \"significant amount\" of gunfire was heard in the area of the protests throughout the night, but no arrests were made, Granda said.</p>\n\n<p>Akinmoladun said many black residents believe <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.kancty\">Kansas City</location> police wrongfully shot and killed three black men in recent months and they want such shootings to end.</p>\n\n<p>\"We want (police) to understand that we will keep protesting,\" she said. \"We are here and we are watching and if these shootings continue, we will be back.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Tribune's <person>Anna Brugmann</person> contributed to this report.</p>",
