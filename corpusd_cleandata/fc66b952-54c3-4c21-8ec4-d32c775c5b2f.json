    "text": "The American Red Cross has an urgent need for blood donations to prevent\nanother blood shortage as hospitals resume surgical procedures and patient\ntreatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHealthy individuals who are feeling well are asked to make an appointment to\ndonate in the weeks and months ahead by downloading the free Red Cross Blood\nDonor App, visiting [RedCrossBlood.org](http://RedCrossBlood.org), calling\n1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any\nAlexa Echo device.\n\nIn recent weeks, hospital demand for blood products has grown by 30 percent\nafter sharply declining in early April amid this rapidly changing and complex\npublic health crisis.\n\nAt the same time, blood drives continue to be canceled as many businesses and\ncommunity organizations remain closed.\n\nDonors are needed to make and keep scheduled appointments to help meet the\ncurrent need.\n\nAll those who come to give through May 31 will receive a special Red Cross\nT-shirt by mail, while supplies last.\n\nAnd thanks to Amazon, all those who come to give June 1-30 will receive a $5\n[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) gift card via email. Restrictions apply.\nAdditional information and details are available at\n[RedCrossBlood.org/Together](http://RedCrossBlood.org/Together).\n\nIt's important to remember that red blood cells must be transfused within 42\ndays of donation and platelets within just five days. So, they must constantly\nbe replenished.\n\nThere is no known end date in this fight against coronavirus, and the Red\nCross urgently needs the help of donors and blood drive hosts to ensure blood\nproducts are readily available for patients.\n\nUpcoming blood donation opportunities include:\n\n\u0095 June 4 from 1 to 6 p.m. at First Presbyterian Church, 27 Albany St.,\nCazenovia.\n\n\u0095 June 12 from 1 to 6 p.m. at St Paul's United Methodist Church, 551 Sayles\nSt., Oneida.\n\nAll blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients.\n\nA blood donor card or driver's license or two other forms of identification\nare required at check-in.\n\nIndividuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent\nwhere allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally\ngood health may be eligible to donate blood.\n\nHigh school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to\nmeet certain height and weight requirements.\n\nFor more information, visit [redcross.org](http://redcross.org) or\n[cruzrojaamericana.org](http://cruzrojaamericana.org).",

Restrictions apply. Additional information and details are available at <a href=\"http://RedCrossBlood.org/Together\">RedCrossBlood.org/Together</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to remember that red blood cells must be transfused within 42 days of donation and platelets within just five days. So, they must constantly be replenished.</p>\n\n<p>There is no known end date in this fight against coronavirus, and the <org>Red Cross</org> urgently needs the help of donors and blood drive hosts to ensure blood products are readily available for patients.</p>\n\n<p>    Upcoming blood donation opportunities include:</p>\n\n<p>&#149; <chron>June 4</chron> from <chron>1 to 6 p.m.</chron> at <org>First Presbyterian Church</org>, <location>27 Albany St.</location>, Cazenovia.</p>\n\n<p>&#149; <chron>June 12</chron> from <chron>1 to 6 p.m.</chron> at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.stpaul\">St Paul's</location> <org>United Methodist Church</org>, <location>551 Sayles St.</location>, Oneida.</p>\n\n<p>All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients.</p>\n\n<p>A blood donor card or driver's license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood.</p>\n\n<p>High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://redcross.org\">redcross.org</a> or <a href=\"http://cruzrojaamericana.org\">cruzrojaamericana.org</a>.</p>",
