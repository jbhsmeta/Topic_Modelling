(WKRN) - Tennessee Highway Patrol tells our sister station,\nWKRN News 2 at least 10,000 people marched through the streets of Nashville on\nThursday afternoon demanding racial justice.\n\nFranklin teenagers Jade Fuller and Emma Rose Smith, both 15, founded the\ncoalition, Teens 4 Equality, with three other teenagers, hoping to create a\nconversation of unity in Tennessee.\n\nThe coalition planned the march with the support of Black Lives Matter\nNashville. The rally started at Bicentennial Mall at 4 p.m. and ended with a\nmarch to the State Capitol.\n\nFuller and Smith said they were motivated after the death of George Floyd.\n\nAt Thursday's march, News 2's CB Cotton spoke with Smith who said, \" we're the\nface of tomorrow and if we don't start changing things today, there won't be a\nbetter future tomorrow.\"\n\nFuller said she hoped people could shift their focus to the peaceful protests,\nin a previous interview with News 2 both Fuller and Smith said they always\nanticipated for Thursday's planned march to be peaceful.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fuller said, \"The protest I went to on Saturday [the 'I Will\nBreathe' rally]  for the first four hours of it, and even when it ended was\ncompletely peaceful. People are saying peaceful protesters, are riot-ers. They\naren't, they're separate.\"",
