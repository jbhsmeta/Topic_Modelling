    "text": "Neighbors Spokane, Cd'A so close, yet so far away with COVID-19\n\nWhile a state line and COVID-19 precautions separate eastern Washington and\nNorth Idaho, the divide is porous. Thousands of people stream across it every\nday to work, live and play.\n\nOn a bright evening last week, a family walked with their two young children\nto pick up take-out food in Spokane's Kendall Yards. They had the extra money\nto spend, in some ways, because of that divide.\n\nThe husband, who asked to remain anonymous, works for a roofing supply company\nin Washington. Because construction remained essential in Idaho during the\nearly weeks of the pandemic, he was able to continue working.\n\nHe said traveling across the state line every day during the stay-at-home\norder felt like traveling into a world where the pandemic didn't exist.\nTraffic stayed the same.\n\n\"Idaho's not dangerous,\" he said, moving to stand in front of his children's\nstroller to block the late-May sun. \"Masses of people are dangerous, but you\ncan't really put a line and say this is safe and this is not.\"\n\nIn September 2014, Spokane County employers attracted an estimated 7,500\nworkers residing in Kootenai County, according to a Pew Research Center study.\n\nA 2005 study found that about 15,000 Spokane workers earn at least part of\ntheir salaries in Kootenai County.\n\nAs Idaho entered stage three of Gov. Brad Little's rebound order Saturday,\nallowing bars and movie theaters to reopen and gatherings of up to 50 people,\nSpokane residents were still under Gov. Jay Inslee's stay-at-home order. With\na county-by-county approach to reopening, Spokane County is in phase two, with\nsome restaurants opening last week for dine-in service.\n\n\"Idaho is considered one of the three least-regulated states because of the\npandemic,\" Kootenai County Commissioner Chris Fillios said.\n\nWhile people in both states are encouraged to wear face masks in public to\nprevent the spread of the virus, in Kootenai County a majority of masked\npopulace can usually only be found in Costco.\n\nSpokane resident Maggie Dale said she recently saw a photograph from 1919 with\neveryone wearing masks.\n\n\"They learned how to take the pandemic seriously,\" Dale said. \"I'm concerned\nwe may not be taking it as seriously.\"\n\nIdaho announced 41 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the third\nstraight day the state had reported 30 or more cases for a single date. The\nIdaho Statesman reported the rise had not happened since a streak of five\nconsecutive days of 30 or more reported cases April 6-10.\n\nAccording to the Panhandle Health District, Kootenai County had only one new\nCOVID-19 case in the past week, only three since restaurants, salons and gyms\nreopened on May 15, and just 67 total. Spokane County, however, reported 30\nnew cases Friday, bringing the county total to 570. Based on total confirmed\ncases, Spokane County has an infection rate of 0.1%, while Kootenai County\nsits at 0.04%.\n\nFillios said that while Idaho has not been as stringent as Washington, it is\nimpossible to pinpoint the reason behind the state's lower infection rate.\n\n\"Maybe we did a better job of social distancing, I can only speculate,\"\nFillios said.\n\nPHD officials previously told The Press that North Idaho's relatively low\npopulation density could play a part in its low case count. They also said the\ncommunity has done an excellent job in adhering to social-distancing\nguidelines.\n\nAs Little pushed the state through the rebound phases, communities in North\nIdaho were eager to get back to normal life.\n\nBonner County commissioners rejected the governor's stay-at-home order\nThursday, calling it unconstitutional, even as residents throughout the five\nnorthern counties celebrated the summer weather.\n\nFamilies gathered Friday with friends at City Beach, while children huddled\ntogether to purchase a treat from the ice cream man. Young adults played\nvolleyball in McEuen Park while toddlers flocked to the water play area\ndespite play structures remaining closed. Restaurant balconies throughout\ndowntown overflowed with hungry customers. It felt, as the man in Kendall\nYards said, like any summer evening outside, the pandemic a world away.\n\nOn North Monroe Street in Spokane, the door to Giant Nerd Books was plastered\nin jovial, handwritten signs reading: \"Limit 5 people max, including staff\"\nand \"No mask? No Entry. No Exceptions!\"\n\nNathan Huston has owned and operated the quirky bookstore for almost seven\nyears.\n\n\"I'm high risk for respiratory illness and so are a couple of people in my\nfamily,\" Huston said. \"As a small business owner, I'm not just responsible for\nmyself and my family, but the safety of the people who walk through my door\nand their families.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a young woman tried to come inside the bookstore without a mask.\nHuston told her he was sorry, but that without a mask he would have to ask her\nto leave. At the time, a gentleman in his 70s was in the store, selling used\nbooks. As the young woman refused to don a mask and left, the man thanked\nHuston.\n\n\"People for the most part have been really supportive,\" Huston said.\n\nBusiness owners and elected officials in both states admitted there will be\nsome awkwardness as the states reopen at different paces. The father in\nKendall Yards said it's up to the people crossing that line to follow what is\ngoing on in each state.\n\nIn Idaho, nonessential travel resumed Saturday. The 14-day self-quarantine for\npeople entering the state has been discontinued, opening the Gem State's\ntourist doors just in time for summer.\n\nA group of 30-somethings drinking cocktails at the Moose Lounge on a sun\ndappled Thursday evening on Sherman Avenue said they weren't worried about the\ncoronavirus at all.\n\n\"The danger here isn't comparable to Spokane,\" one man said.\n\nAnother young woman said her stepmother has cancer, so she tries to distance\nherself from her but doesn't take precautions to distance herself from others.\nHer friend, a few drinks in, said the pandemic ruined his life. As he\ndescribed how he lost his contract with the U.S. Army, tears welled. He had a\nfresh haircut that glistened in the sun.\n\n\"I won't get it back,\" he said, anger in his voice.\n\nThat same golden evening 30 miles away in downtown Spokane, the Peace Pie\nPizzeria and Black Label Brewing reopened for dine-in service to a modest\ncrowd. Co-owner Josh Fox asked patrons to use hand sanitizer upon entry. Fox\nsaid those going out know the rules regarding COVID-19 precautions and are\nabiding by them.\n\n\"It's just a matter of time until we get back to normal,\" Fox said.",

    "html": "<p>Neighbors Spokane, Cd'A so close, yet so far away with COVID-19</p>\n<p>While a state line and COVID-19 precautions separate eastern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">North Idaho</location>, the divide is porous. Thousands of people stream across it every day to work, live and play.</p>\n\n<p>On a bright evening last week, a family walked with their two young children to pick up take-out food in Spokane's Kendall Yards. They had the extra money to spend, in some ways, because of that divide.</p>\n\n<p>The husband, who asked to remain anonymous, works for a roofing supply company in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington</location>. Because construction remained essential in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location> during the early weeks of the pandemic, he was able to continue working.</p>\n\n<p>He said traveling across the state line every day during the stay-at-home order felt like traveling into a world where the pandemic didn't exist. Traffic stayed the same.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho's</location> not dangerous,\" he said, moving to stand in front of his children's stroller to block the late-May sun. \"Masses of people are dangerous, but you can't really put a line and say this is safe and this is not.\"</p>\n\n<p>In <chron>September 2014</chron>, Spokane County employers attracted an estimated 7,500 workers residing in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.koonai\">Kootenai County</location>, according to a <org>Pew Research Center</org> study.</p>\n\n<p>A 2005 study found that about 15,000 Spokane workers earn at least part of their salaries in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.koonai\">Kootenai County</location>.</p>\n\n<p>As <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location> entered stage three of Gov. <person>Brad Little's</person> rebound order Saturday, allowing bars and movie theaters to reopen and gatherings of up to 50 people, Spokane residents were still under Gov. <person>Jay Inslee's</person> stay-at-home order. With a county-by-county approach to reopening, Spokane County is in phase two, with some restaurants opening last week for dine-in service.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location> is considered one of the three least-regulated states because of the pandemic,\" <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.koonai\">Kootenai County</location> Commissioner <person>Chris Fillios</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>While people in both states are encouraged to wear face masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.koonai\">Kootenai County</location> a majority of masked populace can usually only be found in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:COST\">Costco</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Spokane resident <person>Maggie Dale</person> said she recently saw a photograph from 1919 with everyone wearing masks.</p>\n\n<p>\"They learned how to take the pandemic seriously,\" Dale said. \"I'm concerned we may not be taking it as seriously.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location> announced 41 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the third straight day the state had reported 30 or more cases for a single date. <org>The Idaho Statesman</org> reported the rise had not happened since a streak of five consecutive days of 30 or more reported cases <chron>April 6-10</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <location>Panhandle Health District</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.koonai\">Kootenai County</location> had only one new COVID-19 case in the past week, only three since restaurants, salons and gyms reopened on <chron>May 15</chron>, and just 67 total. Spokane County, however, reported 30 new cases Friday, bringing the county total to 570. Based on total confirmed cases, Spokane County has an infection rate of 0.1%, while <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.koonai\">Kootenai County</location> sits at 0.04%.</p>\n\n<p>Fillios said that while <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location> has not been as stringent as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington</location>, it is impossible to pinpoint the reason behind the state's lower infection rate.</p>\n\n<p>\"Maybe we did a better job of social distancing, I can only speculate,\" Fillios said.</p>\n\n<p>PHD officials previously told The Press that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">North Idaho's</location> relatively low population density could play a part in its low case count. They also said the community has done an excellent job in adhering to social-distancing guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>As Little pushed the state through the rebound phases, communities in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">North Idaho</location> were eager to get back to normal life.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.bonner\">Bonner County</location> commissioners rejected the governor's stay-at-home order Thursday, calling it unconstitutional, even as residents throughout the five northern counties celebrated the summer weather.</p>\n\n<p>Families gathered Friday with friends at City Beach, while children huddled together to purchase a treat from the ice cream man. Young adults played volleyball in <location>McEuen Park</location> while toddlers flocked to the water play area despite play structures remaining closed. Restaurant balconies throughout downtown overflowed with hungry customers. It felt, as the man in Kendall Yards said, like any summer evening outside, the pandemic a world away.</p>\n\n<p>On <location>North Monroe Street</location> in Spokane, the door to <org>Giant Nerd Books</org> was plastered in jovial, handwritten signs reading: \"Limit 5 people max, including staff\" and \"No mask? No Entry. No Exceptions!\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Nathan Huston</person> has owned and operated the quirky bookstore for almost seven years.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm high risk for respiratory illness and so are a couple of people in my family,\" Huston said. \"As a small business owner, I'm not just responsible for myself and my family, but the safety of the people who walk through my door and their families.\"</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, a young woman tried to come inside the bookstore without a mask. Huston told her he was sorry, but that without a mask he would have to ask her to leave. At the time, a gentleman in his 70s was in the store, selling used books. As the young woman refused to don a mask and left, the man thanked Huston.</p>\n\n<p>\"People for the most part have been really supportive,\" Huston said.</p>\n\n<p>Business owners and elected officials in both states admitted there will be some awkwardness as the states reopen at different paces. The father in Kendall Yards said it's up to the people crossing that line to follow what is going on in each state.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location>, nonessential travel resumed Saturday. The 14-day self-quarantine for people entering the state has been discontinued, opening the Gem State's tourist doors just in time for summer.</p>\n\n<p>A group of 30-somethings drinking cocktails at the <org>Moose Lounge</org> on a sun dappled Thursday evening on <location>Sherman Avenue</location> said they weren't worried about the coronavirus at all.</p>\n\n<p>\"The danger here isn't comparable to Spokane,\" one man said.</p>\n\n<p>Another young woman said her stepmother has cancer, so she tries to distance herself from her but doesn't take precautions to distance herself from others. Her friend, a few drinks in, said the pandemic ruined his life. As he described how he lost his contract with the <org>U.S. Army</org>, tears welled. He had a fresh haircut that glistened in the sun.</p>\n\n<p>\"I won't get it back,\" he said, anger in his voice.</p>\n\n<p>That same golden evening 30 miles away in downtown Spokane, the <org>Peace Pie Pizzeria</org> and Black Label Brewing reopened for dine-in service to a modest crowd. Co-owner <person>Josh Fox</person> asked patrons to use hand sanitizer upon entry. Fox said those going out know the rules regarding COVID-19 precautions and are abiding by them.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's just a matter of time until we get back to normal,\" Fox said.</p>",
