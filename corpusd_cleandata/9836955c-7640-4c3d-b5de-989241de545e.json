    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Agriculture\nDaily \\-- Researchers detail new data in Environment - Environmental Impact.\nAccording to news reporting originating from Milan, Italy, by NewsRx\ncorrespondents, research stated, \"Among the different agricultural activities,\nthe livestock is one of the most impacting on the environment. The feeding of\nanimals is often the main responsible of the adverse environmental impact\nrelated to animal productions.\"\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of\nMilan, \"Above all for intensive production, the consumption of protein feed is\na key aspect for the achievement of sustainable production processes. The\nactual consumption of soybean meal and fish meal is not sustainable due to the\nrelated environmental impact and to the increasing prices. Among the different\nalternative protein sources, in the last 20 years, the attention of research\ncentres and private companies focused on insects, algae and other\ninvertebrates but, up to now, little consideration was paid to the use of\nfresh earthworm or earthworm meal as a protein feed for monogastric animals.\nThe use of earthworms as an alternative protein source for fish and poultry\nfeeding is an opportunity for providing environmental services via cleaner\ntechnologies. Thanks to earthworms, organic wastes and by-products generated\nby livestock activities can be valorised and become a resource for animal\nfeeding in a circular perspective. In this context, this manuscript was\ndesigned to summarize the productivity, suitability and effectiveness issues\nconnected with the utilization of earthworms as alternative protein feed in\npoultry production as well as in aquaculture. The studies investigating the\nearthworm meal use are quite old above all those carried out in Europe;\nhowever, some general indications can be drawn: both for broiler and fish, the\nparameters usually evaluated are body weight gain, growth rate, feed intake\nand feed conversion rate, the acceptability level of earthworm meal in broiler\ndiet is lower than 15% while in trout diet ranges between 25 and 30%.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The inclusion of\nearthworm meal in diets with an inclusion level lower than the acceptability\nthreshold allows good productive performances without affecting the quality of\nthe final food products.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Earthworm as an alternative protein\nsource in poultry and fish farming: Current applications and future\nperspectives. _The Science of the Total Environment_ , 2020;734():139460. _The\nScience of the Total Environment_ can be contacted at: Elsevier Science BV, PO\nBox 211, 1000 AE Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nThe news editors report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting A.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Agriculture Daily</org> -- Researchers detail new data in Environment - Environmental Impact. According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/it..milan\">Milan, Italy</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Among the different agricultural activities, the livestock is one of the most impacting on the environment. The feeding of animals is often the main responsible of the adverse environmental impact related to animal productions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the <org>University of Milan</org>, &#8220;Above all for intensive production, the consumption of protein feed is a key aspect for the achievement of sustainable production processes. The actual consumption of soybean meal and fish meal is not sustainable due to the related environmental impact and to the increasing prices. Among the different alternative protein sources, in the last 20 years, the attention of research centres and private companies focused on insects, algae and other invertebrates but, up to now, little consideration was paid to the use of fresh earthworm or earthworm meal as a protein feed for monogastric animals. The use of earthworms as an alternative protein source for fish and poultry feeding is an opportunity for providing environmental services via cleaner technologies. Thanks to earthworms, organic wastes and by-products generated by livestock activities can be valorised and become a resource for animal feeding in a circular perspective. In this context, this manuscript was designed to summarize the productivity, suitability and effectiveness issues connected with the utilization of earthworms as alternative protein feed in poultry production as well as in aquaculture. The studies investigating the earthworm meal use are quite old above all those carried out in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>; however, some general indications can be drawn: both for broiler and fish, the parameters usually evaluated are body weight gain, growth rate, feed intake and feed conversion rate, the acceptability level of earthworm meal in broiler diet is lower than 15% while in trout diet ranges between 25 and 30%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;The inclusion of earthworm meal in diets with an inclusion level lower than the acceptability threshold allows good productive performances without affecting the quality of the final food products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Earthworm as an alternative protein source in poultry and fish farming: Current applications and future perspectives. <em>The Science of the Total Environment</em>, 2020;734():139460. <em>The Science of the Total Environment</em> can be contacted at: <org>Elsevier Science BV</org>, PO Box 211, 1000 AE <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/nl..amster\">Amsterdam, Netherlands</location>.</p>\n<p>The news editors report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.
