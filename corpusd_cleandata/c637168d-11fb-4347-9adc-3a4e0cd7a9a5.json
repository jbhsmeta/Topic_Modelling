    "text": "HENDERSON \\- Nebraska State Troopers arrested a Lincoln man who was wanted in\nconnection with a shooting that occurred just after midnight Thursday in Grand\nIsland.\n\nThe arrest is the result of an 18-hour search for the suspect between Aurora\nand Henderson.\n\nAt approximately 12:50 a.m., Thursday, a trooper observed a Chevrolet\nTrailblazer traveling eastbound on Interstate 80 near Aurora. The vehicle\nmatched the description of one being sought by the Grand Island Police\nDepartment in connection with a shooting that occurred approximately 30\nminutes earlier, according to the Nebraska State Patrol.\n\nThe trooper initiated a traffic stop near mile marker 335. Two occupants of\nthe vehicle were quickly taken into custody, but a third occupant fled the\ntraffic stop on foot. Additional troopers and Hamilton County Sheriff's\nDeputies arrived on scene to search the area. The person who fled the traffic\nstop was identified as the suspect of the shooting currently under\ninvestigation by Grand Island Police.\n\nLaw enforcement continued searching the area throughout the day. Thursday\nafternoon, an arrest warrant was issued in Hall County for Antoine Johnson,\n33, of Lincoln, on charges of attempt of a Class I/1A/1B/1C/1D felony, use of\na firearm to commit a felony, assault in the first degree, and use of a\nfirearm to commit a felony.\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, NSP received information that Johnson may be in the\narea just south of Interstate 80 at the Henderson exit at mile marker 342.\nTroopers proceeded to the scene and were able to locate Johnson hiding in a\nditch approximately one mile south of I-80. Johnson was taken into custody at\napproximately 6:45 p.m. without incident.\n\nAssisting with the situation, including the day-long manhunt, were the\nHamilton County Sheriff's Department, the York County Sheriff's Department and\nthe Henderson Police Department.\n\nJohnson has been transported to Hall County Jail. The Grand Island Police\nDepartment is the lead investigating agency of the shooting that took place\nearly Thursday morning.",
