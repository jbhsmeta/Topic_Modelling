    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Drug\nDaily \\-- Current study results on Drugs and Therapies - Benzodiazepine\nAnticonvulsants have been published. According to news reporting from\nGuanajuato, Mexico, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Under certain\nconditions many pharmaceuticals can accumulate in organic phases due to their\nlow polarity. It is possible that with such drugs in the presence of other\nsubstances, like surfactants, an accumulation phenomenon may occur.\"\n\nFinancial supporters for this research include National Council of Science and\nTechnology (CONACYT), University of Guanajuato.\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University\nof Guanajuato, \"In this work, a study has been performed in order to determine\nthe influence of surfactants, like soy lecithin, on the behavior of diazepam\nand chlorpheniramine distribution between an organic and an aqueous phase.\nFirst, the extraction of CPM and DZP without soy lecithin was evaluated. As\nexpected, the molecular form (non-charged) were the best extracted. The\nextraction of CPM and DZP were close to 100% at pH 8.7 and pH 5, respectively.\nOn the other hand, the results show that the presence of a surfactant\nincreases the drug accumulation into the organic phase towards lower values of\npH, where the predominated forms of drugs are the protonated for\nchlorpheniramine (CPMH+) and neutral for diazepam (DZP), this being more\nimportant in the chlorpheniramine case which is extracted as CPMH+.SL-. A\nmodel for extraction of both drugs was developed and tested: in absence of soy\nlecithin partition coefficients of 181.7 and 19.1 were obtained for\nchlorpheniramine and diazepam, respectively. In presence of soy lecithin, the\nmodel considers the presence of CPME+ and (CPMH2) (2+) in the aqueous phase,\nmeanwhile in the organic phase the model takes into account as extracted\nspecies CPMH+.SL- and CPM.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The extraction\nconstants values obtained were K-ext(,CPMH)+ = 0. 20 L.mol(-1) and\nK-ext(,(CPMH2))2+ = 1.89*10(-6).\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Distribution Modeling of Diazepam\nand Chlorpheniramine Between Aqueous and Non-polar Phases In the Presence of\nSoy Lecithin. _Journal of Molecular Liquids_ , 2020;303():. _Journal of\nMolecular Liquids_ can be contacted at: Elsevier, Radarweg 29, 1043 Nx\nAmsterdam, Netherlands.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>NewsRx Drug Daily</org> -- Current study results on Drugs and Therapies - Benzodiazepine Anticonvulsants have been published. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/mx.gu\">Guanajuato, Mexico</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Under certain conditions many pharmaceuticals can accumulate in organic phases due to their low polarity. It is possible that with such drugs in the presence of other substances, like surfactants, an accumulation phenomenon may occur.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Financial supporters for this research include <org>National Council</org> of Science and Technology (CONACYT), <org>University of Guanajuato</org>.</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the <org>University of Guanajuato</org>, &#8220;In this work, a study has been performed in order to determine the influence of surfactants, like soy lecithin, on the behavior of diazepam and chlorpheniramine distribution between an organic and an aqueous phase. First, the extraction of CPM and DZP without soy lecithin was evaluated. As expected, the molecular form (non-charged) were the best extracted. The extraction of CPM and DZP were close to 100% at pH 8.7 and pH 5, respectively. On the other hand, the results show that the presence of a surfactant increases the drug accumulation into the organic phase towards lower values of pH, where the predominated forms of drugs are the protonated for chlorpheniramine (CPMH+) and neutral for diazepam (DZP), this being more important in the chlorpheniramine case which is extracted as CPMH+.SL-. A model for extraction of both drugs was developed and tested: in absence of soy lecithin partition coefficients of 181.7 and 19.1 were obtained for chlorpheniramine and diazepam, respectively. In presence of soy lecithin, the model considers the presence of CPME+ and (CPMH2) (2+) in the aqueous phase, meanwhile in the organic phase the model takes into account as extracted species CPMH+.SL- and CPM.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;The extraction constants values obtained were K-ext(,CPMH)+ = 0. 20 L.mol(-1) and K-ext(,(CPMH2))2+ = 1.89*10(-6).&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Distribution Modeling of Diazepam and Chlorpheniramine Between Aqueous and Non-polar Phases In the Presence of Soy Lecithin. <em><org>Journal of Molecular Liquids</org></em>, 2020;303():. <em><org>Journal of Molecular Liquids</org></em> can be contacted at: <org>Elsevier</org>, Radarweg 29, 1043 Nx <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/nl..amster\">Amsterdam, Netherlands</location>.
