    "text": "India, June 5 \\-- State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday said its board will\nmeet next week to consider raising up to USD 1.5 billion (about Rs 11,330\ncrore) through a public offer and/or private placement of bonds. The Executive\nCommittee of the Central Board is scheduled to meet on June 11 to consider\nlong-term fund raising, the country\"s largest lender said in a regulatory\nfiling.\n\nThe committee will \"examine the status and decide on long term fund raising in\nsingle/ multiple tranches up to USD 1.5 billion through a public offer and/or\nprivate placement of senior unsecured notes in US Dollar or any other\nconvertible currency during FY 2020-21,\" the filing said.\n\nEarlier in November, SBI had raised Rs 3,813.60 crore through perpetual bonds\nto fund its business growth.\n\nIt had allotted 38,136 non-convertible, taxable, subordinated, unsecured\nBasel-III compliant AT-1 bonds in the nature of debentures to raise the funds.\n\nUnder the Basel-III norms, AT-1 bonds come with loss absorbency features,\nmeaning that in case of stress, banks can write off such investments or\nconvert them into common equity if approved by the Reserve Bank of India.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dion Global\nSolutions Limited.
