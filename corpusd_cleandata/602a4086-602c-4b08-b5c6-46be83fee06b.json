    "text": "Senator Christopher Bong Go welcomed state media company Intercontinental\nBroadcasting Corporations (IBC-13) offer to use its television facilities as a\nremote learning platform. The proposal should enable the Department of\nEducation to air curriculum-based programs when schools reopen on August 24,\n2020.\n\nSenator Go previously urged the education department to explore alternative\nmeans to ensure continued learning process of students amid COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch alternative modes should ensure the safety of the students and without\nunnecessarily putting additional burden on the part of their parents.\n\nUse the technology available for distance learning such as having virtual\nclassrooms. There are also airtime allotted for educational programs legally,\nwhich can be used as an alternative mode of teaching and learning, he stated.\n\nThe Senator cited Republic Act No. 8370, also known as the Childrens\nTelevision Act of 1997, which requires a minimum of 15% of a networks daily\ntotal air time to programs that further childrens positive development.\n\nGo also called for a review of teaching strategies that were based on new\ntechnology whilst taking into consideration the availability of the internet.\nThe use of broadcast media would ensure a more inclusive access to learning by\nallowing students without internet access to participate.\n\nNot all teens have access to the internet or smart phones. It would be a great\nhelp to use 'free TV' for education, he said.\n\nIn his latest report to Congress, President Rodrigo Duterte revealed that the\nsatellite television industry is in active dialogue with the government\nregarding remote learning opportunities.\n\nThe government also aims to use the state-owned IBC-13 to air curriculum-based\ntelevision programs to students in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon.\nPresidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Martin Andanar said\nthe network, currently underutilized, would require a P100-million investment\nto widen its reach.\n\n\"We do not want to delay the class, but we always prioritize the safety and\nhealth of Filipinos,\" said Go, who is also chair of the Senate Committee on\nHealth and Demography. The Senator has staunchly backed President Duterte's\ncall to not permit face-to-face learning until a vaccine for COVID-19 is\navailable.\n\nWe will take this one step at a time so that we can slowly, but surely,\nprotect the safety of our students. 'Let's not go too far. Let's assess first\nwhat happens in the coming days. Different weeks, different days may happen.\nAlthough we do not want to delay their class, they are important, Go\ncautioned.\n\nHe noted that the use of broadcast media would enable rural schools, which\noften lacked an adequate supply of teachers and classrooms, to accommodate\nmore students, including the beneficiaries of the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-\nasa program.\n\nLet's look at how our lives can continue in the 'new normal' era. Let's put in\nplace the necessary policies and protocols. We will make sure that young\npeople get their education as we continue to fight COVID-19, he said.\n\nEarlier, Go filed Senate Bill No. 396 months after being elected as Senator in\n2019, which seeks to amend the Local Government Code of 1991 by expanding the\napplication of the Special Education Fund (SEF) taken from the additional 1%\non real property tax. The bill will enable local government units to the SEF\nto operate Alternative Learning System programs as well as provide the\nsalaries, allowances and other benefits of ALS facilitators.",

    "title": "Philippines : Bong Go welcomes use of IBC-13 as remote learning platform; sees broadcast medias potential to provide continued learning opportunities under the new normal [Al Bawaba Business]",
    "html": "<p>Senator <person>Christopher Bong Go</person> welcomed state media company Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporations (IBC-13) offer to use its television facilities as a remote learning platform. The proposal should enable the <org>Department of Education</org> to air curriculum-based programs when schools reopen on <chron>August 24, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p><person>Senator Go</person> previously urged the education department to explore alternative means to ensure continued learning process of students amid COVID-19 pandemic. Such alternative modes should ensure the safety of the students and without unnecessarily putting additional burden on the part of their parents.</p>\n<p>Use the technology available for distance learning such as having virtual classrooms. There are also airtime allotted for educational programs legally, which can be used as an alternative mode of teaching and learning, he stated.</p>\n<p>The Senator cited Republic Act No. 8370, also known as the Childrens Television Act of 1997, which requires a minimum of 15% of a networks daily total air time to programs that further childrens positive development.</p>\n<p>Go also called for a review of teaching strategies that were based on new technology whilst taking into consideration the availability of the internet. The use of broadcast media would ensure a more inclusive access to learning by allowing students without internet access to participate.</p>\n<p>Not all teens have access to the internet or smart phones. It would be a great help to use 'free TV' for education, he said.</p>\n<p>In his latest report to <org>Congress</org>, President <person>Rodrigo Duterte</person> revealed that the satellite television industry is in active dialogue with the government regarding remote learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>The government also aims to use the state-owned IBC-13 to air curriculum-based television programs to students in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon. Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary <person>Martin Andanar</person> said the network, currently underutilized, would require a P100-million investment to widen its reach.</p>\n<p>\"We do not want to delay the class, but we always prioritize the safety and health of Filipinos,\" said Go, who is also chair of the <org>Senate Committee on Health and Demography</org>. The Senator has staunchly backed <person>President Duterte's</person> call to not permit face-to-face learning until a vaccine for COVID-19 is available.</p>\n<p>We will take this one step at a time so that we can slowly, but surely, protect the safety of our students. 'Let's not go too far. Let's assess first what happens in the coming days. Different weeks, different days may happen. Although we do not want to delay their class, they are important, Go cautioned.</p>\n<p>He noted that the use of broadcast media would enable rural schools, which often lacked an adequate supply of teachers and classrooms, to accommodate more students, including the beneficiaries of the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa program.</p>\n<p>Let's look at how our lives can continue in the 'new normal' era. Let's put in place the necessary policies and protocols. We will make sure that young people get their education as we continue to fight COVID-19, he said.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Go filed Senate Bill No. 396 months after being elected as Senator in 2019, which seeks to amend the Local Government Code of 1991 by expanding the application of the <org>Special Education Fund</org> (SEF) taken from the additional 1% on real property tax. The bill will enable local government units to the SEF to operate Alternative Learning System programs as well as provide the salaries, allowances and other benefits of ALS facilitators.</p>",
