    "text": "AUTHENTICATED U.S. GOVERNMENT INFORMATION\n\nAdministration of Donald J. Trump, 2020\n\nApril 30, 2020\n\nThe President. Okay, thank you very much. It's an honor to be with Governor\nPhil Murphy of a wonderful State known as New Jersey. I spend a lot of time in\nNew Jersey. It's a beautiful State. People don't realize how dense it is,\nright?\n\nGov. Murphy. That's right.\n\nThe President. They keep saying, I guess, you're number two? And I've even\nheard number, right?\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes, I think number one.\n\nThe President. Nobody would think that about New Jersey. But it's a great\nplace and a great State. And they have a wonderful man that's running it,\nwho's-he runs it with heart and with brains, and he's done a terrific job. We\nare together. We are working closely. I think we- somebody said we got you\nmore ventilators maybe than any other State, which surprised me also.\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes.\n\nThe President. But you've used them well.\n\nGov. Murphy. Thank you.\n\nThe President. And your numbers are headed in the right direction. And I just\nwant to thank the Governor and his very capable people. The relationship has\nbeen a very good one.\n\nGov. Murphy. Thank you, sir.\n\nThe President. And we're working very hard with New Jersey. We're working hard\nwith everybody. But we're working hard with this Governor. He's one of the\nGovernors that's really done a job. He's stepped up to the plate, and he has-\nand he swung, and he's just-you're going to see the results very soon.\n\nSo, with that, I'd like to ask-Phil, perhaps you'd like to say a few words.\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes, first of all, Mr. President, to you and your team, we're\nincredibly honored to be here. I thank you for the enormous help in our\ndarkest hour of need: ventilators, as you could see; PPE; testing sites. Now,\nI think, we're going to be in a very good place thanks to you and your team as\nit relates to expanding testing dramatically so that we'll be able to begin to\ntake those steps to reopen.\n\nWe've been crushed as a State, as you know. It's a State you know very well.\nWe have 6,770 fatalities. But the curves, thank God, are beginning to show\npromise. And we're beginning to take some baby steps on that road to reopen.\nIn fact, we've announced that, as of this weekend, our State, county parks,\ngolf, under certain protocols, as of Saturday morning will be able to be open\nagain.\n\nThe President. Good.\n\nGov. Murphy. And that's a step on that road. And again, we couldn't be making\nthe progress we're making without you and your administration.\n\nAnd so to you and to your incredibly talented team with a very heavy dose of\nNew Jersey blood on your team, including yourself-[laughter].\n\nThe President. That's true,\n\nGov. Murphy.-who knows that State extremely well, we thank you for everything,\n\nAnd again, financially, that's another topic we'll-you know, we've been\ncrushed, and I appreciate your consideration on the financial side going\nforward as well,\n\nSo thank you for everything,\n\nThe President. Thank you very much, And we have been helping on the hospitals,\nAnd your hospitals have been really under stress, to put it mildly, right?\n\nGov. Murphy. Amen,\n\nThe President. You know, you have some hospitals where you don't have such a\nbig COVID problem, and they do what they do, In fact, they really could do a\nlot more, because they weren't allowed to use the elective,\n\nGov. Murphy. Correct,\n\nThe President. And by not having the elective, all of a sudden, they had such\na different situation from you\n\nGov. Murphy. No question,\n\nThe President.-because you had to use it for COVID, and it was a tremendous\nstrain,\n\nGov. Murphy. You bet,\n\nThe President. So we're going to work with you on that, We have been, but\nwe're going to be working with you on that,\n\nGov. Murphy. Thank you,\n\nThe President. I just want to thank you for the great job you've done,\n\nGov. Murphy. Thank you, Mr, President, And likewise, thank you for your\npartnership and leadership on this, It's meant an enormous amount on our\nState,\n\nThe President. Thank you very much, And you know, I have to speak as President\nbut I also speak as somebody that is in New Jersey a lot, It's a great place,\nIt's a beautiful State, People don't understand New Jersey quite, But it's a\nbeautiful State, And it's great to have you as the Governor,\n\nGov. Murphy. Thank you, Mr, President,\n\nThe President. Thank you very much,\n\nGov. Murphy. An honor to be with you, And this is a big deal for us, Thank\nyou,\n\nThe President. Thank you very much, And by the way, he's a Democrat, so I'm\ngetting myself in trouble, but that's okay, [Laughter] I have to tell the\ntruth, He's something,\n\nSo any questions? Jim [Jim Acosta, CNN],\n\nEconomic Recovery Efforts/ Coronavirus Outbreak in China\n\nQ. Mr, President, your economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, said this morning that\nthe unemployment rate could be around 19 percent, numbers we haven't seen\nsince the Great Depression, What is you plan to get the country out of this\nditch?\n\nThe President. Well, I think we're going to have a great third quarter. That's\ngoing to be a transition. So when I say \"great,\" I think the transition is\ngoing to be really terrific. And we're going to take it into the fourth, and I\nthink we're going to have, potentially, a great fourth quarter.\n\nThere's tremendous pent-up demand. I don't know if Kevin said that or Larry\nKudlow. But they're telling-they see it. But I feel it. I feel it. I think\nsometimes what I feel is better than what I think, unfortunately or\nfortunately, Phil. [Laughter]\n\nBut I tell you what: I feel it. And I will say that I think next year is going\nto be a spectacular year in terms of growth, in terms of bringing our country\nback. I think we're going to have a really good year. We want to be where we\nwere. And I think we can actually surpass where we were. And we were the\nstrongest anywhere in the world. We were the best that we ever were, but we\nwere the strongest anywhere in the world.\n\nBut I view what we have now as obviously a period of-here we are; this-it is\nwhat it is. We just got hit by a vicious virus that should have never been\nallowed to escape China. They should have stopped it at the source. They\ndidn't do that. A hundred and eighty-four countries have been devastated by\nit, including China, by the way. Because I looked at their numbers, and their\nnumbers are terrible. And it's just a very tough situation for the people of\nour country. All the loss, the death, it's a terrible thing.\n\nBut I think we're going to make a very strong comeback. It will start with the\nthird quarter. I think you're going to see some pretty good numbers. I think\nyou're going to see really good transition numbers. But the fourth quarter is\ngoing to be-I really believe it's going to be terrific. And I think that next\nyear is going to be a great year.\n\n2020 Presidential Election/Federal Coronavirus Response/Availability of\nMedical Supplies and Equipment\n\nQ. Is it fair for the voters to take into consideration your handling of the\npandemic when they assess whether to reelect you in the fall?\n\nThe President. Sure, I think they do. I think they have to do a number of\nthings. They do have to do that. And maybe Phil could speak to that, because I\nthink I've handled it-and not me; I think our whole group has been\nspectacular. We had ventilators; we didn't have any. We built them. We have\nthousands-tens of thousands are right now under construction. And we've given-\nas Phil said, you got, I think, more ventilators than anybody in the United\nStates.\n\nGov. Murphy. I believe that's correct.\n\nThe President. New Jersey needed them very badly.\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes.\n\nThe President. And there was never a person that needed a ventilator that\ndidn't get one in any State. Not one person that needed a ventilator. So we\ndidn't say: \"He didn't get a ventilator, and somebody passed away. Somebody\ndidn't make it.\"\n\nNow, we had a mask problem. Now we have so many masks, we don't know what to\ndo with them. We had a big problem.\n\nAnd you have to understand: When we took over, the cupboards were bare. And\nthe thing that-frankly, it's not as tough as the ventilator situation. We're\nthe king of ventilators. But what we have done is-on testing, we're doing\nnumbers the likes of which nobody has ever seen before.\n\nAnd I told you, the President of South Korea, President Moon, called me to\ncongratulate me on testing. And we did more tests than any other country\nanywhere in the world. And I think they told me yesterday a number, if you add\nup the rest of the world, we've done more testing. And it's a higher quality\ntest.\n\nSo I think we've done a-I think the whole team, Federal Government-we built\nhospitals for you and others.\n\nGov. Murphy. You bet.\n\nThe President. We built medical centers. And I'm talking about thousands and\nthousands of beds. Many, many medical centers. We had-as you know, we had the\nGovernor of Florida and the Governor of Louisiana over the last 2 days. They\ncould not have been-and one was a Democrat, and this gentleman happens to be a\nproud Democrat. They could not have been more supportive of the effort of the\nFederal Government.\n\nAnd I'll tell you, Jim-\n\nQ. But aren't you seeing massive lines for food?\n\nThe President. Let me just tell you, we have-we started off with empty\ncupboards. The last administration left us nothing. We started off with bad,\nbroken tests and obsolete tests.\n\nWhat we've come up with, between the Abbott Laboratories, where you have the\n5-minute test. Did they test you today?\n\nGov. Murphy. They did test me. For\n\nThe President. Good. Now I feel better. [Laughter]\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes, yes, yes. I'm negative.\n\nThe President. You did the 5-minute-the Abbott test.\n\nGov. Murphy. I did the quick turnaround.\n\nThe President. It's so great.\n\nGov. Murphy. I feel like a new man. [Laughter]\n\nThe President. That's a brand-you know what? That's a brandnew test. That\ndidn't exist 8 weeks ago, and now it's like the rage. Everybody wants that\ntest.\n\nNo, I think we've done-\n\nQ. [Inaudible]\n\nThe President. I think we've done a really great job.\n\nCoronavirus Testing Access/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment/2009\nH1N1 Influenza Pandemic\n\nQ. But the Obama administration-people from the Obama administration would\ndisagree on your assessment that the cupboards were bare. They said that there\nwas equipment in\n\nThe President. Well-well-I know, Jim.\n\nQ.-the National Stockpile.\n\nThe President. Let me just tell you-I-that's fine.\n\nQ. And as for, you say, broken tests, it's a new virus. So how could the test\nbe broken when you needed a new test?\n\nThe President. We had a broken-Jim, we had broken tests. We had tests that\nwere obsolete. We had tests that didn't take care of people.\n\nBut here's what's very important: If you take a look at the swine flu,\nH1N1-or, as Joe Biden would say, N1H1, but it's actually wrong. He didn't even\nknow the name, okay? H1N1-the swine flu-the Obama administration was a\ndisaster. And they did polling on how did they do, and their polls were so\nnegative, so bad. They did a very poor job.\n\nAnd they did a poor job on a lot of things. They did a poor job on our\nmilitary. They did a poor job on our ammunition. When I got here, we had no\nammunition. Just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical too.\n\nSo I think, when you ask how did we do-and I have to say it, because the news\nis so fake and so corrupt-I think we did a spectacular job. I'm not even\nreferring to me. I'm referring to all of these people, including your people\nwho have been working with my people so closely.\n\nGov. Murphy. You bet. You bet.\n\nThe President. But the Federal Government has done a spectacular job, to a\npoint where we're building, now-we're going to have thousands and thousands of\nventilators, and we're helping other countries. Because Phil doesn't need\nventilators. You needed them very badly at the beginning.\n\nGov. Murphy. We did. We did.\n\nThe President. And maybe you could say something to Jim's question.\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes, I don't know-I don't have a view on the history, but I will\nsay this: In our hour of need, whether it was ventilators, the Army Corps\nbuilding out capacity, FEMA with our testing sites, and a big part of our\nability to reopen as fast as we all want to is to rapidly expand testing.\n\nThe President. Right.\n\nGov. Murphy. And you all-literally, in the here and now, this week-are helping\nus in a big way to at least-I would expect by the end of May, thanks to you\nand your team's help, we'll be able to at least double, and I hope more than\ndouble, our testing capabilities. And because of that, that will allow us to\nmuch more aggressively and responsibly do the reopening that we all need to\ndo.\n\nThe President. And, Phil, how did we do on ventilators, as an example, where\nyou were really in-\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes.\n\nThe President. -you needed them badly?\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes. We got them. I mean, there's just no other way to put it.\nAnd I'm told that we were the number-one State recipient of ventilators.\n\nThe President. I've heard that. Yes.\n\nGov. Murphy. And this was-you know, we were at the edge, and this is life-or-\ndeath stuff. And we got them, and we are forever thankful for that.\n\nThe President. Thank you, Phil.\n\nCoronavirus Vaccine Development/Experimental Drugs and Therapies\n\nQ. Mr. President, on operation-on this vaccine Operation Warp Speed, who's in\ncharge of that? And are you overpromising when you say you're going to have\n300 million doses of vaccine in 8 months?\n\nThe President. No, I'm not overpromising. I don't know who said it, but\nwhatever the maximum is, whatever you can humanly do, we're going to have. And\nwe hope we're going to come up with a good vaccine.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and Oxford and lots of different great companies,\nrepresentatives of our country in some time-in some ways. NIH is working very\nhard and doing a terrific job. No, I hope we're going to have a vaccine, and\nwe're going to fast-track it like you've never seen before, if we come up with\na vaccine. I think they probably will.\n\nQ. And who is in charge of that Operation Warp Speed?\n\nThe President. We have-you know who is in charge of it? Honestly? I am. I'll\ntell you, I'm really in charge of it. I could say somebody else. I will say,\nwe're dealing with, as you know, the general and the admiral. They're very\nmuch in charge. But I think probably, more than anything, I'm in charge. And\nI'm the one that gets blamed. And I get blamed anyway.\n\nDon't forget, if we come up with a vaccine in record time, they'll say I\nshould have done it faster. But we have a lot of good possibilities. Like the\nGilead yesterday, that was a big thing. That was a big thing. And as\nexplained-and I think very importantly, that was a step. You know, that was a\nbig step: 31-percent step. But the step means, I guess, Deborah-what Tony,\nyesterday, was explaining-the step means you now take another step, another.\nAll of a sudden, you're up to 50, 60, 70. But that was a very positive-that\nwas a big step, as I understand it.\n\nOkay? Thank you.\n\nQ. Mr. President\n\nQ. Mr. President\n\nThe President. Yes. Go ahead, please.\n\nQ. Oh-\n\nQ. Thank you-\n\nThe President. Yes, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters]. Go.\n\nThe President's Intelligence Briefings/Coronavirus Outbreak in China\n\nQ. Thank you, sir. The intelligence agencies today said that they agree with\nthe scientific community, that the virus did originate in China but was not\nmanmade and was not genetically modified. Do you agree with that assessment?\n\nThe President. Well, I haven't seen the report yet, but I will tell you, if\nyou speak to the head of intelligence right now, you speak to the head, they\ndid say that I was given a briefing when I said I was given it, not before.\nAnd they also said that it wasn't specific and it was not a panic briefing. It\nwasn't like, \"Oh, we're going to be invaded.\" It was in January, later\nJanuaryQ.\n\nYou were getting a briefing in January?\n\nThe President. And I think-I think what you'll do is you'll speak to them. In\nfact, I'll ask Mark to make a report to you because the-the news was totally-\nyou know, as usual, fake and corrupt.\n\nSo intelligence is doing a report, and the report turned out to be exactly as\nI said.\n\nThe President's Intelligence Briefings\n\nQ. So, Mr. President, so you're saying that you got a briefing in January\nabout theThe\n\nPresident. No, I'm not saying it. No, no. I'm not.\n\nQ.-about the coronavirus.\n\nThe President. You didn't hear me. I said intelligence is saying it. And\nthey're going to give a report\n\nQ. Okay.\n\nThe President.-and it will make you very unhappy, because it makes you so\nwrong.\n\nQ. Well\n\nThe President. You, in particular.\n\nAll right. Go ahead. Behind you, please.\n\nFederal Assistance to States\n\nQ. Governor, States received $150 billion in the first CARES Act. What are you\ngoing to need now to get back on your feet? What have you told the President\non that front? And how do you address Republican complaints that the Federal\nGovernment should not be bailing out States who were badly managed prior to\nthe pandemic?\n\nGov. Murphy. Yes. Yes. So I've been in office 2-going on 2\u00bd years, and I got\nelected to, sort of, fix the economy. And we made a lot of progress on what I\nwould call the \"legacy issues\": record pension payments, stabilizing\nindebtedness, record surpluses. And as Mike Tyson says, \"Everyone's got a plan\nuntil you get punched in the face.\"\n\nThe President. [Laughter] And we did.\n\nGov. Murphy. And we did. So we've made-we've got a plan, and we're comfortable\nwith the progress that-it's going to take a while, all the legacy stuff.\n\nThe financial assistance we need-and we need a significant amount; this is a\nbig hit, and this is somewhere, in New Jersey alone, could be $20 to $30\nbillion. But this is to allow us to keep firefighters, teachers, police, EMS\non the payroll, serving the communities in their hour of need. And that's\nsomething that we feel strongly about.\n\nWe don't see it as a bailout. We see this as a partnership, doing the right\nthing in what is the worst health care crisis in the history of our Nation.\nAnd I want to again thank the President for an extraordinary spirit of\npartnership across the whole spectrum of our needs. And I want to reiterate\nthat.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe President. I will say, that's a tough question, because you're talking\nabout the States, and whether you call it a bailout or a lot of money, and\nit's-a lot of it's for years, long before you were there. You can't have a\nbetter representative than this man, that I can tell you. Plus, he's an old\nGoldman Sachs guy. [Laughter] And what they don't know about him-he's done a\ngreat job, but he went through a big operation just before this happened, and\nthat's a hell of a thing.\n\nGov. Murphy. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe President. You know, that was a big deal.\n\nNational Food Supply/Meatpacking Industry\n\nQ. Mr. President-Mr. President, are you worried about the food supply chain\nbreakdown-\n\nThe President. No, not at all. No. We solved that problem\n\nQ. -especially in the meat market?\n\nThe President. We solved that problem yesterday. I expect to see the supply\nchain as strong as ever, maybe stronger, for certain reasons.\n\nWe did something. We got-we had a roadblock though. It was a legal roadblock\nmore than anything else. It was a foolish thing that nobody ever took care of\nfor a long time, and we took care of it.\n\nNo, I expect things to go very smoothly.\n\nQ. So the American people shouldn't worry about any shortage in the market at\nall?\n\nThe President. Not even a little bit. There's a lot of supply too. But now\nthey're going to get it. And that was solved yesterday very late in the\nevening. Okay?\n\nQ. Mr. President-\n\nEconomic Stimulus Legislation/Federal Coronavirus Response/National Economy\n\nQ. Mr. President, at what point do people need another check if unemployment\nis at 20 percent?\n\nThe President. Well, we're talking about that. I know a lot of people are\ntalking about it. But we've given a lot of stimulus. And again, we think now\nit's so great. I'm so happy that you're opening up parks and things, because\nthat's a big step for New Jersey, because they were hit very hard.\n\nI think that-I think you're going to see something that's going to surprise\nmaybe the world. And you know, we're the leader of the world. We're really the\nleader. In this case, the leader of the world. And we've done better. If you\nlook at our deaths, if you look at mortality rates, if you look at the things,\nwe're-in fact, I'm going to get a chart, because it's maybe the most\nimpressive thing-right?-how we've done. And that's a tribute to the Governors,\nand it's a tribute to the Federal Government and all of us working together.\n\nBut I would love you to get that, if you could. Because we're right at the\ntop, meaning top, in a positive way, of those charts.\n\nI think you're going to see economic numbers that are going to be fantastic. I\nbelieve it very strongly. And you're going to start to see it with the\ntransition period, which is number three. And quarter four, you're going to\nhave tremendous numbers. Tremendous numbers.\n\nQ. Would you-\n\nThe President. And I think next year you're going to really have tremendous\nnumbers.\n\nQ. Mr. President-\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/News Media\n\nQ. Mr. President, can we ask you about General Flynn?\n\nThe President. Yes.\n\nQ. Are you going to pardon him? This is what you tweeted back in December of\n2017: \"I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and\nthe FBI.\"\n\nThe President. Yes.\n\nQ. Do you still believe that he lied to the Vice President and the FBI?\n\nThe President. Yes, well, I'll tell you-\n\nQ. Shouldn't he be punished for that?\n\nThe President. Sure. When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented\nhim. Dirty cops tormented General Flynn. General Flynn is a fine man. Thirty-\nfive years or so in the military. You don't get to be where he is by being\nbad, that I can tell you.\n\nAnd then, he-right at the beginning of the administration the dirty cops came\nin. And you see the notes, Jim. I mean, whether you're on our side, that side,\nwhatever. I mean, I assume, let's all talk about fairness. What they did to\nGeneral Flynn-and by the way, to Roger Stone and to others-was a disaster and\ndisgrace. And it should never be allowed to happen in this country again.\n\nAnd what I really hoped-because CNN tormented him, in all fairness-I really\nhoped to see, because they haven't been doing it, and I appreciate your\nquestion-I hope to see that CNN will not even apologize, which they should,\nbut just cover it fairly, because he's in the process of being exonerated. If\nyou look at those notes from yesterday, that was total exoneration. These were\ndirty, filthy cops at the top of the FBI. And you know the names better than I\ndo, and they were dishonest people.\n\nNow we have to see what's going to happen. But General Flynn was treated like\nnobody should-and I'm not talking about generals; I'm saying like nobody in\nthis country should be treated.\n\nQ. So were you wrong to fire him at the time?\n\nThe President. And they did it right at the beginning.\n\nQ. Why did you fire him at the time?\n\nThe President. They did it right-Jim, they did it right-well, look at what\nthey did to the guy. I mean, he couldn't haven't known too much what was\nhappening. They came at him with 15 buses, and he's standing in the middle of\na highway.\n\nWhat they did to this man-they tormented him; they destroyed him. But he's\ngoing to come back-like I say, he's going to come back bigger and better. But\nwhat they did to him, and I hear there's a lot of other stuff coming out if I\nbelieve everything I'm reading. Because I like to stay out of it. I don't have\nto stay out of it at all. But I like to stay out of it.\n\nAnd, Jim, what they did to him is terrible. And I hope that CNN is going to\ngive him a fair shake and cover it\n\nQ. Is this-\n\nThe President. -because I think it's very important.\n\nYes.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn\n\nQ. But, sir, just to follow up on was it a mistake to fire him? Would you\nbring him back on to the administration?\n\nThe President. Well, what I wish I had was all the information where they were\nout to get him. They wanted him-they were trying to force him to lie. You see\nthe written statements where they were trying to force him into a position\nwhere we can get him on a lie or can we get him this way or that way. This is\nterrible.\n\nThis is like what happened in-and I'm not going to name the countries, because\nwe deal with these countries, okay? But what would happen in other countries,\nnot the U.S.A. What they did to General Flynn and others-and others-is a\ndisgrace.\n\nQ. But he-\n\nThe President. And I hope-really, I hope your networks are going to cover it.\n\nQ. Mr. President\n\nThe President. Because, you know, I've seen where it's the biggest story in\nthe world a year ago and a year and a half-\"Flynn. Flynn. Flynn.\" And then,\nhe's essentially exonerated. Now, that's not official yet. But when you read\nthe notes, how could you do anything else?\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/News Media\n\nQ. In his letter of resignation, though, he admitted to\n\nThe President. And I hear there's-I hear there's much-Jim, I hear there's much\nmore coming out.\n\nQ.-giving bad information to the Vice President.\n\nThe President. I think it would be so good for CNN, if you covered it honestly\nand if you'd report it honestly. It would be so good for the network.\n\nQ. Of course, we have.\n\nThe President. Okay, with that, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you\nvery much. Thank you, Jim.\n\nNOTE: The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House.\nIn his remarks, he referred to National Economic Council Director Lawrence A.\nKudlow; Gov.

Trump</org>, 2020</p>\n<p><chron>April 30, 2020</chron></p>\n<p>The President. Okay, thank you very much. It's an honor to be with Governor <person>Phil Murphy</person> of a wonderful State known as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>. I spend a lot of time in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>. It's a beautiful State. People don't realize how dense it is, right?</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. That's right.</p>\n<p>The President. They keep saying, I guess, you're number two? And I've even heard number, right?</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes, I think number one.</p>\n<p>The President. Nobody would think that about <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>. But it's a great place and a great State. And they have a wonderful man that's running it, who's-he runs it with heart and with brains, and he's done a terrific job. We are together. We are working closely. I think we- somebody said we got you more ventilators maybe than any other State, which surprised me also.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes.</p>\n<p>The President. But you've used them well.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Thank you.</p>\n<p>The President. And your numbers are headed in the right direction. And I just want to thank the Governor and his very capable people. The relationship has been a very good one.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>The President. And we're working very hard with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>. We're working hard with everybody. But we're working hard with this Governor. He's one of the Governors that's really done a job. He's stepped up to the plate, and he has-and he swung, and he's just-you're going to see the results very soon.</p>\n<p>So, with that, I'd like to ask-Phil, perhaps you'd like to say a few words.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes, first of all, Mr. President, to you and your team, we're incredibly honored to be here. I thank you for the enormous help in our darkest hour of need: ventilators, as you could see; PPE; testing sites. Now, I think, we're going to be in a very good place thanks to you and your team as it relates to expanding testing dramatically so that we'll be able to begin to take those steps to reopen.</p>\n<p>We've been crushed as a State, as you know. It's a State you know very well. We have 6,770 fatalities. But the curves, thank God, are beginning to show promise. And we're beginning to take some baby steps on that road to reopen. In fact, we've announced that, as of this weekend, our State, county parks, golf, under certain protocols, as of Saturday morning will be able to be open again.</p>\n<p>The President. Good.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. And that's a step on that road. And again, we couldn't be making the progress we're making without you and your administration.</p>\n<p>And so to you and to your incredibly talented team with a very heavy dose of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> blood on your team, including yourself-[laughter].</p>\n<p>The President. That's true,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>.-who knows that State extremely well, we thank you for everything,</p>\n<p>And again, financially, that's another topic we'll-you know, we've been crushed, and I appreciate your consideration on the financial side going forward as well,</p>\n<p>So thank you for everything,</p>\n<p>The President. Thank you very much, And we have been helping on the hospitals, And your hospitals have been really under stress, to put it mildly, right?</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Amen,</p>\n<p>The President. You know, you have some hospitals where you don't have such a big COVID problem, and they do what they do, In fact, they really could do a lot more, because they weren't allowed to use the elective,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Correct,</p>\n<p>The President. And by not having the elective, all of a sudden, they had such a different situation from you</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. No question,</p>\n<p>The President.-because you had to use it for COVID, and it was a tremendous strain,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. You bet,</p>\n<p>The President. So we're going to work with you on that, We have been, but we're going to be working with you on that,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Thank you,</p>\n<p>The President. I just want to thank you for the great job you've done,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Thank you, Mr, President, And likewise, thank you for your partnership and leadership on this, It's meant an enormous amount on our State,</p>\n<p>The President. Thank you very much, And you know, I have to speak as President but I also speak as somebody that is in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> a lot, It's a great place, It's a beautiful State, People don't understand <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> quite, But it's a beautiful State, And it's great to have you as the Governor,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Thank you, Mr, President,</p>\n<p>The President. Thank you very much,</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. An honor to be with you, And this is a big deal for us, Thank you,</p>\n<p>The President. Thank you very much, And by the way, he's a Democrat, so I'm getting myself in trouble, but that's okay, [Laughter] I have to tell the truth, He's something,</p>\n<p>So any questions? Jim [<person>Jim Acosta</person>, <org>CNN</org>],</p>\n<p>Economic Recovery Efforts/ Coronavirus Outbreak in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location></p>\n<p>Q. Mr, President, your economic adviser, <person>Kevin Hassett</person>, said this morning that the unemployment rate could be around 19 percent, numbers we haven't seen since the Great Depression, What is you plan to get the country out of this ditch?</p>\n<p>The President. Well, I think we're going to have a great third quarter. That's going to be a transition. So when I say \"great,\" I think the transition is going to be really terrific. And we're going to take it into the fourth, and I think we're going to have, potentially, a great fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>There's tremendous pent-up demand. I don't know if Kevin said that or <person>Larry Kudlow</person>. But they're telling-they see it. But I feel it. I feel it. I think sometimes what I feel is better than what I think, unfortunately or fortunately, Phil. [Laughter]</p>\n<p>But I tell you what: I feel it. And I will say that I think next year is going to be a spectacular year in terms of growth, in terms of bringing our country back. I think we're going to have a really good year. We want to be where we were. And I think we can actually surpass where we were. And we were the strongest anywhere in the world. We were the best that we ever were, but we were the strongest anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>But I view what we have now as obviously a period of-here we are; this-it is what it is. We just got hit by a vicious virus that should have never been allowed to escape <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. They should have stopped it at the source. They didn't do that. A hundred and eighty-four countries have been devastated by it, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, by the way. Because I looked at their numbers, and their numbers are terrible. And it's just a very tough situation for the people of our country. All the loss, the death, it's a terrible thing.</p>\n<p>But I think we're going to make a very strong comeback. It will start with the third quarter. I think you're going to see some pretty good numbers. I think you're going to see really good transition numbers. But the fourth quarter is going to be-I really believe it's going to be terrific. And I think that next year is going to be a great year.</p>\n<p>2020 Presidential Election/Federal Coronavirus Response/Availability of <org>Medical Supplies</org> and Equipment</p>\n<p>Q. Is it fair for the voters to take into consideration your handling of the pandemic when they assess whether to reelect you in the fall?</p>\n<p>The President. Sure, I think they do. I think they have to do a number of things. They do have to do that. And maybe Phil could speak to that, because I think I've handled it-and not me; I think our whole group has been spectacular. We had ventilators; we didn't have any. We built them. We have thousands-tens of thousands are right now under construction. And we've given-as Phil said, you got, I think, more ventilators than anybody in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. I believe that's correct.</p>\n<p>The President. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> needed them very badly.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes.</p>\n<p>The President. And there was never a person that needed a ventilator that didn't get one in any State. Not one person that needed a ventilator. So we didn't say: \"He didn't get a ventilator, and somebody passed away. Somebody didn't make it.\"</p>\n<p>Now, we had a mask problem. Now we have so many masks, we don't know what to do with them. We had a big problem.</p>\n<p>And you have to understand: When we took over, the cupboards were bare. And the thing that-frankly, it's not as tough as the ventilator situation. We're the king of ventilators. But what we have done is-on testing, we're doing numbers the likes of which nobody has ever seen before.</p>\n<p>And I told you, the President of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea</location>, <person>President Moon</person>, called me to congratulate me on testing. And we did more tests than any other country anywhere in the world. And I think they told me yesterday a number, if you add up the rest of the world, we've done more testing. And it's a higher quality test.</p>\n<p>So I think we've done a-I think the whole team, Federal Government-we built hospitals for you and others.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. You bet.</p>\n<p>The President. We built medical centers. And I'm talking about thousands and thousands of beds. Many, many medical centers. We had-as you know, we had the Governor of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> and the Governor of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location> over the last 2 days. They could not have been-and one was a Democrat, and this gentleman happens to be a proud Democrat. They could not have been more supportive of the effort of the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>And I'll tell you, Jim-</p>\n<p><person>Q. But</person> aren't you seeing massive lines for food?</p>\n<p>The President. Let me just tell you, we have-we started off with empty cupboards. The last administration left us nothing. We started off with bad, broken tests and obsolete tests.</p>\n<p>What we've come up with, between the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:ABT\">Abbott Laboratories</org>, where you have the 5-minute test. Did they test you today?</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. They did test me. For</p>\n<p>The President. Good. Now I feel better. [Laughter]</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes, yes, yes. I'm negative.</p>\n<p>The President. You did the 5-minute-the Abbott test.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. I did the quick turnaround.</p>\n<p>The President. It's so great.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. I feel like a new man. [Laughter]</p>\n<p>The President. That's a brand-you know what? That's a brandnew test. That didn't exist 8 weeks ago, and now it's like the rage. Everybody wants that test.</p>\n<p>No, I think we've done-</p>\n<p>Q. [Inaudible]</p>\n<p>The President. I think we've done a really great job.</p>\n<p>Coronavirus Testing Access/Availability of <org>Medical Supplies</org> and Equipment/2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic</p>\n<p><person>Q. But</person> the Obama administration-people from the Obama administration would disagree on your assessment that the cupboards were bare. They said that there was equipment in</p>\n<p>The President. Well-well-I know, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q.-the National Stockpile.</p>\n<p>The President. Let me just tell you-I-that's fine.</p>\n<p>Q. And as for, you say, broken tests, it's a new virus. So how could the test be broken when you needed a new test?</p>\n<p>The President. We had a broken-Jim, we had broken tests. We had tests that were obsolete. We had tests that didn't take care of people.</p>\n<p>But here's what's very important: If you take a look at the swine flu, H1N1-or, as <person>Joe Biden</person> would say, N1H1, but it's actually wrong. He didn't even know the name, okay? H1N1-the swine flu-the Obama administration was a disaster. And they did polling on how did they do, and their polls were so negative, so bad. They did a very poor job.</p>\n<p>And they did a poor job on a lot of things. They did a poor job on our military. They did a poor job on our ammunition. When I got here, we had no ammunition. Just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical too.</p>\n<p>So I think, when you ask how did we do-and I have to say it, because the news is so fake and so corrupt-I think we did a spectacular job. I'm not even referring to me. I'm referring to all of these people, including your people who have been working with my people so closely.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. You bet. You bet.</p>\n<p>The President. But the Federal Government has done a spectacular job, to a point where we're building, now-we're going to have thousands and thousands of ventilators, and we're helping other countries. Because Phil doesn't need ventilators. You needed them very badly at the beginning.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. We did. We did.</p>\n<p>The President. And maybe you could say something to Jim's question.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes, I don't know-I don't have a view on the history, but I will say this: In our hour of need, whether it was ventilators, the <org>Army Corps</org> building out capacity, <org>FEMA</org> with our testing sites, and a big part of our ability to reopen as fast as we all want to is to rapidly expand testing.</p>\n<p>The President. Right.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. And you all-literally, in the here and now, this week-are helping us in a big way to at least-I would expect by the end of May, thanks to you and your team's help, we'll be able to at least double, and I hope more than double, our testing capabilities. And because of that, that will allow us to much more aggressively and responsibly do the reopening that we all need to do.</p>\n<p>The President. And, Phil, how did we do on ventilators, as an example, where you were really in-</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes.</p>\n<p>The President. -you needed them badly?</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes. We got them. I mean, there's just no other way to put it. And I'm told that we were the number-one State recipient of ventilators.</p>\n<p>The President. I've heard that. Yes.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. And this was-you know, we were at the edge, and this is life-or-death stuff. And we got them, and we are forever thankful for that.</p>\n<p>The President. Thank you, Phil.</p>\n<p><org>Coronavirus Vaccine Development</org>/Experimental Drugs and Therapies</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President, on operation-on this vaccine Operation Warp Speed, who's in charge of that? And are you overpromising when you say you're going to have 300 million doses of vaccine in 8 months?</p>\n<p>The President. No, I'm not overpromising. I don't know who said it, but whatever the maximum is, whatever you can humanly do, we're going to have. And we hope we're going to come up with a good vaccine.</p>\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:JNJ\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</org> and Oxford and lots of different great companies, representatives of our country in some time-in some ways. <org>NIH</org> is working very hard and doing a terrific job. No, I hope we're going to have a vaccine, and we're going to fast-track it like you've never seen before, if we come up with a vaccine. I think they probably will.</p>\n<p>Q. And who is in charge of that Operation Warp Speed?</p>\n<p>The President. We have-you know who is in charge of it? Honestly? I am. I'll tell you, I'm really in charge of it. I could say somebody else. I will say, we're dealing with, as you know, the general and the admiral. They're very much in charge. But I think probably, more than anything, I'm in charge. And I'm the one that gets blamed. And I get blamed anyway.</p>\n<p>Don't forget, if we come up with a vaccine in record time, they'll say I should have done it faster. But we have a lot of good possibilities. Like the Gilead yesterday, that was a big thing. That was a big thing. And as explained-and I think very importantly, that was a step. You know, that was a big step: 31-percent step. But the step means, I guess, Deborah-what Tony, yesterday, was explaining-the step means you now take another step, another. All of a sudden, you're up to 50, 60, 70. But that was a very positive-that was a big step, as I understand it.</p>\n<p>Okay? Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President</p>\n<p>The President. Yes. Go ahead, please.</p>\n<p><person>Q. Oh</person>-</p>\n<p>Q. Thank you-</p>\n<p>The President. Yes, Jeff [<person>Jeff Mason</person>, Reuters]. Go.</p>\n<p>The President's Intelligence Briefings/Coronavirus Outbreak in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location></p>\n<p>Q. Thank you, sir. The intelligence agencies today said that they agree with the scientific community, that the virus did originate in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> but was not manmade and was not genetically modified. Do you agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>The President. Well, I haven't seen the report yet, but I will tell you, if you speak to the head of intelligence right now, you speak to the head, they did say that I was given a briefing when I said I was given it, not before. And they also said that it wasn't specific and it was not a panic briefing. It wasn't like, \"Oh, we're going to be invaded.\" It was in January, later JanuaryQ.</p>\n<p>You were getting a briefing in January?</p>\n<p>The President. And I think-I think what you'll do is you'll speak to them. In fact, I'll ask Mark to make a report to you because the-the news was totally-you know, as usual, fake and corrupt.</p>\n<p>So intelligence is doing a report, and the report turned out to be exactly as I said.</p>\n<p>The President's Intelligence Briefings</p>\n<p>Q. So, Mr. President, so you're saying that you got a briefing in January about theThe</p>\n<p>President. No, I'm not saying it. No, no. I'm not.</p>\n<p>Q.-about the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The President. You didn't hear me. I said intelligence is saying it. And they're going to give a report</p>\n<p>Q. Okay.</p>\n<p>The President.-and it will make you very unhappy, because it makes you so wrong.</p>\n<p>Q. Well</p>\n<p>The President. You, in particular.</p>\n<p>All right. Go ahead. Behind you, please.</p>\n<p>Federal Assistance to States</p>\n<p>Q. Governor, States received <money>$150 billion</money> in the first CARES Act. What are you going to need now to get back on your feet? What have you told the President on that front? And how do you address Republican complaints that the Federal Government should not be bailing out States who were badly managed prior to the pandemic?</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Yes. Yes. So I've been in office 2-going on 2&#189; years, and I got elected to, sort of, fix the economy. And we made a lot of progress on what I would call the \"legacy issues\": record pension payments, stabilizing indebtedness, record surpluses. And as <person>Mike Tyson</person> says, \"Everyone's got a plan until you get punched in the face.\"</p>\n<p>The President. [Laughter] And we did.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. And we did. So we've made-we've got a plan, and we're comfortable with the progress that-it's going to take a while, all the legacy stuff.</p>\n<p>The financial assistance we need-and we need a significant amount; this is a big hit, and this is somewhere, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> alone, could be <money>$20</money> to <money>$30 billion</money>. But this is to allow us to keep firefighters, teachers, police, EMS on the payroll, serving the communities in their hour of need. And that's something that we feel strongly about.</p>\n<p>We don't see it as a bailout. We see this as a partnership, doing the right thing in what is the worst health care crisis in the history of our Nation. And I want to again thank the President for an extraordinary spirit of partnership across the whole spectrum of our needs. And I want to reiterate that.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>The President. I will say, that's a tough question, because you're talking about the States, and whether you call it a bailout or a lot of money, and it's-a lot of it's for years, long before you were there. You can't have a better representative than this man, that I can tell you. Plus, he's an old Goldman Sachs guy. [Laughter] And what they don't know about him-he's done a great job, but he went through a big operation just before this happened, and that's a hell of a thing.</p>\n<p><person>Gov. Murphy</person>. Thank you, Mr. President.</p>\n<p>The President. You know, that was a big deal.</p>\n<p>National Food Supply/Meatpacking Industry</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President-Mr. President, are you worried about the food supply chain breakdown-</p>\n<p>The President. No, not at all. No. We solved that problem</p>\n<p>Q. -especially in the meat market?</p>\n<p>The President. We solved that problem yesterday. I expect to see the supply chain as strong as ever, maybe stronger, for certain reasons.</p>\n<p>We did something. We got-we had a roadblock though. It was a legal roadblock more than anything else. It was a foolish thing that nobody ever took care of for a long time, and we took care of it.</p>\n<p>No, I expect things to go very smoothly.</p>\n<p>Q. So the American people shouldn't worry about any shortage in the market at all?</p>\n<p>The President. Not even a little bit. There's a lot of supply too. But now they're going to get it. And that was solved yesterday very late in the evening. Okay?</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President-</p>\n<p>Economic Stimulus Legislation/Federal Coronavirus Response/National Economy</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President, at what point do people need another check if unemployment is at 20 percent?</p>\n<p>The President. Well, we're talking about that. I know a lot of people are talking about it. But we've given a lot of stimulus. And again, we think now it's so great. I'm so happy that you're opening up parks and things, because that's a big step for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, because they were hit very hard.</p>\n<p>I think that-I think you're going to see something that's going to surprise maybe the world. And you know, we're the leader of the world. We're really the leader. In this case, the leader of the world. And we've done better. If you look at our deaths, if you look at mortality rates, if you look at the things, we're-in fact, I'm going to get a chart, because it's maybe the most impressive thing-right?-how we've done. And that's a tribute to the Governors, and it's a tribute to the Federal Government and all of us working together.</p>\n<p>But I would love you to get that, if you could. Because we're right at the top, meaning top, in a positive way, of those charts.</p>\n<p>I think you're going to see economic numbers that are going to be fantastic. I believe it very strongly. And you're going to start to see it with the transition period, which is number three. And quarter four, you're going to have tremendous numbers. Tremendous numbers.</p>\n<p>Q. Would you-</p>\n<p>The President. And I think next year you're going to really have tremendous numbers.</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President-</p>\n<p>Former National Security Adviser <person>Michael T. Flynn</person>/News Media</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President, can we ask you about <person>General Flynn</person>?</p>\n<p>The President. Yes.</p>\n<p><person>Q. Are</person> you going to pardon him? This is what you tweeted back in December of 2017: \"I had to fire <person>General Flynn</person> because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\"</p>\n<p>The President. Yes.</p>\n<p>Q. Do you still believe that he lied to the Vice President and the FBI?</p>\n<p>The President. Yes, well, I'll tell you-</p>\n<p>Q. Shouldn't he be punished for that?</p>\n<p>The President. Sure. When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented him. Dirty cops tormented <person>General Flynn</person>. <person>General Flynn</person> is a fine man. Thirty-five years or so in the military. You don't get to be where he is by being bad, that I can tell you.</p>\n<p>And then, he-right at the beginning of the administration the dirty cops came in. And you see the notes, Jim. I mean, whether you're on our side, that side, whatever. I mean, I assume, let's all talk about fairness. What they did to <person>General Flynn</person>-and by the way, to <person>Roger Stone</person> and to others-was a disaster and disgrace. And it should never be allowed to happen in this country again.</p>\n<p>And what I really hoped-because <org>CNN</org> tormented him, in all fairness-I really hoped to see, because they haven't been doing it, and I appreciate your question-I hope to see that <org>CNN</org> will not even apologize, which they should, but just cover it fairly, because he's in the process of being exonerated. If you look at those notes from yesterday, that was total exoneration. These were dirty, filthy cops at the top of the FBI. And you know the names better than I do, and they were dishonest people.</p>\n<p>Now we have to see what's going to happen. But <person>General Flynn</person> was treated like nobody should-and I'm not talking about generals; I'm saying like nobody in this country should be treated.</p>\n<p>Q. So were you wrong to fire him at the time?</p>\n<p>The President. And they did it right at the beginning.</p>\n<p>Q. Why did you fire him at the time?</p>\n<p>The President. They did it right-Jim, they did it right-well, look at what they did to the guy. I mean, he couldn't haven't known too much what was happening. They came at him with 15 buses, and he's standing in the middle of a highway.</p>\n<p>What they did to this man-they tormented him; they destroyed him. But he's going to come back-like I say, he's going to come back bigger and better. But what they did to him, and I hear there's a lot of other stuff coming out if I believe everything I'm reading. Because I like to stay out of it. I don't have to stay out of it at all. But I like to stay out of it.</p>\n<p>And, Jim, what they did to him is terrible. And I hope that <org>CNN</org> is going to give him a fair shake and cover it</p>\n<p>Q. Is this-</p>\n<p>The President. -because I think it's very important.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Former National Security Adviser <person>Michael T. Flynn</person></p>\n<p><person>Q. But</person>, sir, just to follow up on was it a mistake to fire him? Would you bring him back on to the administration?</p>\n<p>The President. Well, what I wish I had was all the information where they were out to get him. They wanted him-they were trying to force him to lie. You see the written statements where they were trying to force him into a position where we can get him on a lie or can we get him this way or that way. This is terrible.</p>\n<p>This is like what happened in-and I'm not going to name the countries, because we deal with these countries, okay? But what would happen in other countries, not the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.A.</location> What they did to <person>General Flynn</person> and others-and others-is a disgrace.</p>\n<p><person>Q. But</person> he-</p>\n<p>The President. And I hope-really, I hope your networks are going to cover it.</p>\n<p>Q. Mr. President</p>\n<p>The President. Because, you know, I've seen where it's the biggest story in the world a year ago and a year and a half-\"Flynn. Flynn. Flynn.\" And then, he's essentially exonerated. Now, that's not official yet. But when you read the notes, how could you do anything else?</p>\n<p>Former National Security Adviser <person>Michael T. Flynn</person>/News Media</p>\n<p>Q. In his letter of resignation, though, he admitted to</p>\n<p>The President. And I hear there's-I hear there's much-Jim, I hear there's much more coming out.</p>\n<p>Q.-giving bad information to the Vice President.</p>\n<p>The President. I think it would be so good for <org>CNN</org>, if you covered it honestly and if you'd report it honestly. It would be so good for the network.</p>\n<p>Q. Of course, we have.</p>\n<p>The President. Okay, with that, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jim.</p>\n<p>NOTE: The President spoke at <chron>11:30 a.m.</chron> in the <org>Oval Office</org> at the <org>White House</org>.
