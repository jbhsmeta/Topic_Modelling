    "text": "Emotions run high as anti-lynching bill stalls in SenateAndrew Taylor, The\nAssociated PressThursdayJun 4, 2020 at 6:08 PMJun 4, 2020 at 10:30\nPMWASHINGTON (AP) \" A Senate impasse over a widely backed bill to designate\nlynching as a federal hate crime boiled over on Thursday in an emotional\ndebate cast against a backdrop of widespread protests over police treatment of\nAfrican Americans.Raw feelings were evident as Sen. Rand Paul \" who is single-\nhandedly holding up the bill despite letting it pass last year \" sought\nchanges to the legislation as a condition of allowing it to pass.But the\nSenate's two black Democrats, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of\nCalifornia, protested, saying the measure should pass as is. The debate\noccurred as a memorial service was taking place for George Floyd, a\nMinneapolis man who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for almost\nnine minutes, sparking the protests that have convulsed the nation.The\nlegislative effort to make lynching a federal hate crime punishable by up to\nlife in prison comes 65 years after 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched in\nMississippi, and follows dozens of failed attempts to pass anti-lynching\nlegislation.The Senate unanimously passed virtually identical legislation last\nyear. The House then passed it by a sweeping 410-4 vote in February but\nrenamed the legislation for Till \" the sole change that returned the measure\nto the Senate.'Black lives have not been taken seriously as being fully human\nand deserving of dignity, and it should not require a maiming or torture in\norder for us to recognize a lynching when we see it,' said Harris.Paul, who\nhas a history of rankling colleagues by slowing down bills, said the\nlegislation was drafted too broadly and could define minor assaults as\nlynching. He also noted that murdering someone because of their race is\nalready a hate crime. He said the Senate should make other reforms, such as\neasing 'qualified immunity' rules that shield police officers from being\nsued.'Rather than consider a good-intentioned but symbolic bill, the Senate\ncould immediately consider addressing qualified immunity and ending police\nmilitarization,' Paul said. He sought to offer an amendment to weaken the\nmeasure, and Booker blocked it.The conflict had been kept relatively quiet as\nBooker and Paul sought an agreement, but media reports recently pegged Paul as\nthe reason the measure is stalled.'Tell me another time when 500-plus Congress\npeople, Democrats, Republicans, House members and senators come together in a\nchorus of conviction and say, 'Now is the time in America that we condemn the\ndark history of our past and actually pass anti-lynching legislation,'' Booker\nsaid.",

The debate occurred as a memorial service was taking place for <person>George Floyd</person>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> man who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes, sparking the protests that have convulsed the nation.The legislative effort to make lynching a federal hate crime punishable by up to life in prison comes 65 years after 14-year-old <person>Emmett Till</person> was lynched in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ms\">Mississippi</location>, and follows dozens of failed attempts to pass anti-lynching legislation.The <org>Senate</org> unanimously passed virtually identical legislation last year. <org>The House</org> then passed it by a sweeping 410-4 vote in February but renamed the legislation for Till \" the sole change that returned the measure to the <org>Senate</org>.'Black lives have not been taken seriously as being fully human and deserving of dignity, and it should not require a maiming or torture in order for us to recognize a lynching when we see it,' said Harris.Paul, who has a history of rankling colleagues by slowing down bills, said the legislation was drafted too broadly and could define minor assaults as lynching. He also noted that murdering someone because of their race is already a hate crime. He said the <org>Senate</org> should make other reforms, such as easing 'qualified immunity' rules that shield police officers from being sued.'Rather than consider a good-intentioned but symbolic bill, the <org>Senate</org> could immediately consider addressing qualified immunity and ending police militarization,' Paul said. He sought to offer an amendment to weaken the measure, and Booker blocked it.The conflict had been kept relatively quiet as Booker and Paul sought an agreement, but media reports recently pegged Paul as the reason the measure is stalled.'Tell me another time when 500-plus <org>Congress</org> people, <org>Democrats</org>, <org>Republicans</org>, House members and senators come together in a chorus of conviction and say, 'Now is the time in America that we condemn the dark history of our past and actually pass anti-lynching legislation,'' Booker said.</p>",
