    "text": "Former \"Top Chef\" contestant Carrie Baird's new restaurant was open for just\nseven days when the coronavirus outbreak prompted health officials to order an\nimmediate halt to in-person dining across Colorado.\n\nShe was still finessing the menu at Rose's Classic Americana, including her\nsignature Fancy Toast, when she was forced to close. Now, she's trying to\nfigure out how to reopen as health rules relax and diners begin returning to\nrestaurants across the country.\n\nFor many Americans tired of baking sourdough and eating their own cooking,\nthose restaurants reopening in the coming weeks will look different than\nbefore.\n\n\"We always say that food's the easy part,\" says Baird, 40, who was also a 2019\nfinalist for a James Beard \"Best Chef\" award. \"I'm confident I can deliver you\na meal you can't recreate at home. But all the other parts? That's a lot\nharder. The days of 'Cheers' and sitting down at a bar and rubbing elbows with\na stranger and shooting the s--- are going to be over.\"\n\nA study by reservation service OpenTable indicated that as many as 25% of\nrestaurants nationally may never reopen, the victim of razor-thin margins even\nunder the best of times.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association says its members lost $30 billion in March\nand $50 billion in April, staggering losses for an industry that employed\nabout 12 million people before the outbreak. Many of the country's restaurant\nemployees were the first to lose their jobs and some restaurateurs are\nstruggling to entice back workers who've found the $600 weekly federal\nunemployment payments - on top of their state's unemployment payment - more\nlucrative, never mind safer.\n\nExperts say most restaurants will need to find a happy medium between taking\nsafety precautions and creating a welcoming environment. After all, most\npeople who eat out are seeking a social experience.\n\n\"It will be different. It will feel different. It will look different,\" said\nLarry Lynch, a longtime food-safety expert and a senior vice president of the\nNational Restaurant Association. \"It's already proven that restaurants can\neffectively and safely prepare food. In terms of the actual preparation of\nfood, we know that works. It's the front of the house where the changes become\nmore obvious.\"\n\nThe federal government has issued guidelines for restaurants and bars that\ncall for them to follow state and local rules, encourage social distancing\nwhile dining, and recommends checking workers for illness when feasible.\n\nThe Restaurant Association has now released its own guidelines and a training\nvideo explaining what it considers to be best practices, including cleaning\nregimens, distancing suggestions and mask protocols. And states are developing\ntheir own rules: Florida, for instance, has already permitted restaurants to\nreopen as long as they limit occupancy to 25% of their usual capacity. And in\nWyoming, restaurants must limit groups to no more than six, and tables must be\nat least six feet apart.\n\nAlmost every state allowing restaurants to reopen is also requiring frequent\ncleaning and sanitation, although Wisconsin reopened with no restrictions in\nplace after the state Supreme Court overruled the governor's quarantine\norders.\n\nLynch and other experts described how a typical sit-down dining experience\nmight unfold for most diners across the country: You'll make a reservation in\nadvance, and potentially even place your order then. Once you arrive at the\nrestaurant, you'll wait in your vehicle or outside until a text tells you it's\ntime to come in, and you'll be immediately seated at a table with hand\nsanitizer, distanced from other diners.\n\nYour server, who might bring your utensils only after you've been seated, may\nonly return to clear the table once, and perhaps another time to ensure you've\ngot water to drink. There won't be any self-service buffets or soda machines.\nOnce you've paid - preferably with a credit card or phone - you might leave\nthe restaurant by a different door than the one you entered.\n\nAnd pretty much every person you see will be wearing a mask.\n\nEverything, Lynch said, will be designed to reduce interactions between and\namong guests and staff.\n\n\"We'll lose some of that face-to-face contact but we'll make sure you're\nfeeling safe,\" he said. \"Every conversation I've had since we started working\non this is 'how do I reassure the customers.' \"\n\nSome restaurants see safety concerns as a way to differentiate themselves. The\ncompany that owns Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes, for instance, wants\nthe public to know that every worker has their temperature taken when\narriving. Experts say full-service restaurants will likely struggle at first\nbecause they require patrons to step into a space that's been off-limits for\nmonths: a dining room.\n\nIn Denver, chef Caroline Glover is struggling with the same choices: When\nshould she reopen her award-winning restaurant Annette for in-person dining?\nDuring the shutdowns, she and her staff switched to serving takeout meals of\nfried chicken, burgers and pork chops at about half their normal volume. A\nSmall Business Administration loan has helped keep her afloat, but she worries\nthat reopening too soon could expose a customer or employee to infection.\n\n\"Everybody's scared, and for good reason,\" she said. \"People might feel they\nare literally risking their lives to eat out.\"",

    "html": "<p>Former \"Top Chef\" contestant <person>Carrie Baird's</person> new restaurant was open for just seven days when the coronavirus outbreak prompted health officials to order an immediate halt to in-person dining across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location>.</p>\n<p>She was still finessing the menu at Rose's Classic Americana, including her signature Fancy Toast, when she was forced to close. Now, she's trying to figure out how to reopen as health rules relax and diners begin returning to restaurants across the country.</p>\n\n<p>For many Americans tired of baking sourdough and eating their own cooking, those restaurants reopening in the coming weeks will look different than before.</p>\n\n<p>\"We always say that food's the easy part,\" says Baird, 40, who was also a 2019 finalist for a <person>James Beard \"Best Chef</person>\" award. \"I'm confident I can deliver you a meal you can't recreate at home. But all the other parts? That's a lot harder. The days of 'Cheers' and sitting down at a bar and rubbing elbows with a stranger and shooting the s--- are going to be over.\"</p>\n\n<p>A study by reservation service OpenTable indicated that as many as 25% of restaurants nationally may never reopen, the victim of razor-thin margins even under the best of times.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3100247720\">National Restaurant Association</org> says its members lost <money>$30 billion</money> in March and <money>$50 billion</money> in April, staggering losses for an industry that employed about 12 million people before the outbreak. Many of the country's restaurant employees were the first to lose their jobs and some restaurateurs are struggling to entice back workers who've found the <money>$600</money> weekly federal unemployment payments - on top of their state's unemployment payment - more lucrative, never mind safer.</p>\n\n<p>Experts say most restaurants will need to find a happy medium between taking safety precautions and creating a welcoming environment. After all, most people who eat out are seeking a social experience.</p>\n\n<p>\"It will be different. It will feel different. It will look different,\" said <person>Larry Lynch</person>, a longtime food-safety expert and a senior vice president of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3100247720\">National Restaurant Association</org>. \"It's already proven that restaurants can effectively and safely prepare food. In terms of the actual preparation of food, we know that works. It's the front of the house where the changes become more obvious.\"</p>\n\n<p>The federal government has issued guidelines for restaurants and bars that call for them to follow state and local rules, encourage social distancing while dining, and recommends checking workers for illness when feasible.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Restaurant Association</org> has now released its own guidelines and a training video explaining what it considers to be best practices, including cleaning regimens, distancing suggestions and mask protocols. And states are developing their own rules: <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, for instance, has already permitted restaurants to reopen as long as they limit occupancy to 25% of their usual capacity. And in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wy\">Wyoming</location>, restaurants must limit groups to no more than six, and tables must be at least six feet apart.</p>\n\n<p>Almost every state allowing restaurants to reopen is also requiring frequent cleaning and sanitation, although <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> reopened with no restrictions in place after the state Supreme Court overruled the governor's quarantine orders.</p>\n\n<p>Lynch and other experts described how a typical sit-down dining experience might unfold for most diners across the country: You'll make a reservation in advance, and potentially even place your order then. Once you arrive at the restaurant, you'll wait in your vehicle or outside until a text tells you it's time to come in, and you'll be immediately seated at a table with hand sanitizer, distanced from other diners.</p>\n\n<p>Your server, who might bring your utensils only after you've been seated, may only return to clear the table once, and perhaps another time to ensure you've got water to drink. There won't be any self-service buffets or soda machines. Once you've paid - preferably with a credit card or phone - you might leave the restaurant by a different door than the one you entered.</p>\n\n<p>And pretty much every person you see will be wearing a mask.</p>\n\n<p>Everything, Lynch said, will be designed to reduce interactions between and among guests and staff.</p>\n\n<p>\"We'll lose some of that face-to-face contact but we'll make sure you're feeling safe,\" he said. \"Every conversation I've had since we started working on this is 'how do I reassure the customers.' \"</p>\n\n<p>Some restaurants see safety concerns as a way to differentiate themselves. The company that owns Burger King, <person>Tim Hortons</person> and <org>Popeyes</org>, for instance, wants the public to know that every worker has their temperature taken when arriving. Experts say full-service restaurants will likely struggle at first because they require patrons to step into a space that's been off-limits for months: a dining room.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>, chef <person>Caroline Glover</person> is struggling with the same choices: When should she reopen her award-winning restaurant Annette for in-person dining? During the shutdowns, she and her staff switched to serving takeout meals of fried chicken, burgers and pork chops at about half their normal volume. A <org>Small Business Administration</org> loan has helped keep her afloat, but she worries that reopening too soon could expose a customer or employee to infection.</p>\n\n<p>\"Everybody's scared, and for good reason,\" she said. \"People might feel they are literally risking their lives to eat out.\"</p>",
