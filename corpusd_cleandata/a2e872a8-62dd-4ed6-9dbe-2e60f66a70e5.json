    "text": "Gov. Jim Justice joined West Virginia health leaders and other officials for\nhis latest daily press briefing regarding the States COVID-19 response.\n\nThe Comeback Week 6 Reopenings Scheduled for Friday:\n\nDuring Monday afternoons briefing, Gov. Justice announced that today marks the\nstart of Week 6 of his plan to reopen the state: West Virginia Strong The\nComeback.\n\nThe next wave of reopenings are scheduled for this Friday, June 5. Businesses\npermitted to resume operations on Friday include:\n\nCasinos (Safety guidelines)\n\nMovie theaters (Safety guidelines)\n\nReopening businesses must properly follow all additional safety guidelines.\nBusinesses included in each phase of this reopening plan are not required to\nresume operations on any specific date. This plan provides the option for\nreopening, not a requirement. The Governors Safer at Home order remains in\neffect at this time.\n\nFinal Results of Huttonsville Correctional Facility Testing:\n\nGov. Justice provided an update on COVID-19 test results from Huttonsville\nCorrectional Center and Jail in Randolph County, announcing that all 1,089\ninmate and employee test results have now come back. Since his previous update\non Friday, two more inmates test results came back positive, bringing the\nfinal number of positive inmates to 118. No additional staff members have\ntested positive.\n\nThe Division of Corrections is surely on top of this and theyre providing\nconstant updates, Gov. Justice said. I want to thank the Division of\nCorrections, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard for\nall of their work in responding to this outbreak. Gov. Justice also reported\nMonday that, to-date, testing has been conducted on 149 additional inmates at\nother correctional facilities across the state, with zero test results coming\nback positive.\n\nAs a result of the recent developments at the Huttonsville facility, Gov.\nJustice ordered last week that all inmates and employees at every corrections\nfacility across West Virginia be tested for COVID-19 as soon as possible, as a\nprecautionary measure in efforts to curtail the spread of the virus. Were\ngoing to continue to stay on top of the situation at all of our correctional\nfacilities, Gov. Justice said. Thats exactly what we ought to be doing we run\nto the fire and we absolutely try to put the fire out with the greatness of\nall the people that are working on it.",
