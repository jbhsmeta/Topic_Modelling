    "text": "By Aaron Recuenco\n\nPolice anti-narcotics agents seized on Thursday (June 4) some P5 billion worth\nof shabu (crystal methamphetamine) when they raided a warehouse in Marilao,\nBulacan, one of the biggest drug hauls in the government's campaign against\nillegal drugs.\n\nGen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP),\nsaid the operation also resulted in the arrest of Chinese national Yuwen Cai\nand Filipinas Angela Tulio and Ma. Lyn Tulio.\n\nThe Chinese suspect, according to Gamboa, appears to be the trusted man of the\ndrug syndicate while the two Filipinas could be associates tasked to do\nerrands for the arrested foreigner.\n\nGamboa said the operation was an offshoot of a surveillance operation which\nthe PNP Drug Enforcement Group has been conducting against a drug syndicate\noperating in the country.\n\n\"There was a necessity to conduct surveillance hoping that we may find\nsomething here, and it turned out positive,\" Gamboa said in an interview.\n\nHe was referring to the warehouse at #2 Reley St., in Barangay Lias, Marilao\nCity. The operation was conducted at around 3 p.m.\n\nSeized were 63 boxes containing approximately 756 kilograms of shabu.\n\n\"With the packaging, we believe that these are importation because we believe,\nand even PDEA (Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency) believes that there are no\nlonger big laboratories in the country,\" Gamboa said.\n\n\"What we have here are kitchen-type [laboratories] which can produce\napproximately five to seven kilos of shabu every week. With more than 700\nkilos, imagine how many weeks they can do that,\" he added.\n\nGamboa said the packaging itself does not suggest that the substance was made\nin a kitchen-type laboratory. He said the packaging contains Japanese\ncharacters, which he said, could be a deviation from the actual origin of the\nillegal drugs.\n\nGiven the huge quantity of the illegal drugs, Gamboa said the shabu may also\nhave been meant for distribution in the Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nBased on the estimate, the drug haul has a street value of P5.14 billion.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\n(Photo via Aaron Recuenco/MANILA BULLETIN)",

    "html": "<p>By <person>Aaron Recuenco</person></p>\n\n<p>Police anti-narcotics agents seized on Thursday (<chron>June 4</chron>) some <money>P5\nbillion</money> worth of shabu (crystal methamphetamine) when they raided a\nwarehouse in Marilao, Bulacan, one of the biggest drug hauls in the\ngovernment's campaign against illegal drugs.</p>\n\n<p>Gen. <person>Archie Francisco Gamboa</person>, chief of the <org>Philippine National\nPolice</org> (PNP), said the operation also resulted in the arrest of Chinese\nnational <person>Yuwen Cai</person> and <person>Filipinas Angela Tulio</person> and Ma. <person>Lyn Tulio</person>.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese suspect, according to Gamboa, appears to be the trusted\nman of the drug syndicate while the two Filipinas could be associates\ntasked to do errands for the arrested foreigner.</p>\n\n<p>Gamboa said the operation was an offshoot of a surveillance\noperation which the <org>PNP Drug Enforcement Group</org> has been conducting\nagainst a drug syndicate operating in the country.</p>\n\n<p>\"There was a necessity to conduct surveillance hoping that we\nmay find something here, and it turned out positive,\" Gamboa said\nin an interview.</p>\n\n<p>He was referring to the warehouse at #2 Reley St., in Barangay\nLias, Marilao City. The operation was conducted at around <chron>3 p.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>Seized were 63 boxes containing approximately 756 kilograms of\nshabu.</p>\n\n<p>\"With the packaging, we believe that these are importation\nbecause we believe, and even PDEA (<org>Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency</org>)\nbelieves that there are no longer big laboratories in the country,\"\nGamboa said.</p>\n\n<p>\"What we have here are kitchen-type [laboratories] which can\nproduce approximately five to seven kilos of shabu every week. With more\nthan 700 kilos, imagine how many weeks they can do that,\" he added.</p>\n\n<p>Gamboa said the packaging itself does not suggest that the\nsubstance was made in a kitchen-type laboratory. He said the packaging\ncontains Japanese characters, which he said, could be a deviation from\nthe actual origin of the illegal drugs.</p>\n\n<p>Given the huge quantity of the illegal drugs, Gamboa said the shabu\nmay also have been meant for distribution in the Visayas and Mindanao.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the estimate, the drug haul has a street value of <money>P5.14\nbillion</money>.</p>\n\n<p>CAPTION(S):</p>\n\n<p>(Photo via <person>Aaron Recuenco</person>/<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ph..manila\">MANILA</location> BULLETIN)</p>",
