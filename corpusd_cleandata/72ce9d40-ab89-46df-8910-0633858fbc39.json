    "text": "In place of the traditional graduation ceremonies that many students missed\nout on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Powers Lake Yacht Club put on its own\ncelebration for graduates in the area: A boat parade.\n\nThe idea came from club member Jill Smart, whose son, Douglas Smart, missed\nout on a ceremony after graduating from the University of Colorado Boulder in\nMay with a degree in finance. She had heard about school districts having car\nparades, and with some club events canceled this summer, she thought they\ncould do the same thing but with their boats. People living on the lake were\nable to come out to their pier and watch, celebrating the graduates.\n\nClub commodore Meredith Partridge thought it was a great idea to help make up\nfor students missing out.\n\n\"I've had three graduations in my life,\" Partridge said, \"and with\n(graduations) being canceled, I wanted them to get the recognition they\ndeserved.\"\n\nThe parade, which took place at the end of May, was open to and had graduates\nof all ages, and anyone was able to participate regardless of where they were\nfrom. For health safety, people who participated needed to own boat or to\nborrow from someone they knew.\n\nIn all, 12 boats participated, a better turnout than Partridge expected.\n\nParticipants wore their caps and gowns on their boats, which were decorated\nwith \"congratulations\" signs and flags for their respective schools, as they\nmade their way all around Powers Lake as \"Pomp and Circumstance\" played from a\npier.\n\nJill Smart said each year the club has its own parade where members decorate\ntheir boats, something that helped inspire her idea.\n\nPartridge and Jill Smart both thought the parade for graduates was a great\nsuccess.\n\n\"When we saw people running out of their houses to watch, we thought maybe it\nwas better than a regular graduation ceremony,\" Jill Smart said.\n\nAfterwards, Jill Smart said many of the parents from the boats connected,\ntalking about their children's graduations and futures.\n\nThe students enjoyed the parade, too, getting an opportunity to celebrate\ntheir accomplishments.\n\n\"I think it compensated for a big part of what we missed out on, especially\nfor the college kids,\" Douglas Smart said. \"College students expect a big\ncelebration and getting to share it with their whole family. The boat parade\nwas actually more fun than the commencement would've been.\"\n\nIN PHOTOS: Congrats to the Class of 2020The Class of 2020 is unique in many\nways and its graduation is just one of them. Changes due to social distancing,\nonline ceremonies and more make this a spring of altogether different ways of\ncelebrating.",

    "html": "<p>In place of the traditional graduation ceremonies that many students missed out on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the <org>Powers Lake Yacht Club</org> put on its own celebration for graduates in the area: A boat parade.</p>\n<p>The idea came from club member <person>Jill Smart</person>, whose son, <person>Douglas Smart</person>, missed out on a ceremony after graduating from the <org>University of Colorado Boulder</org> in May with a degree in finance. She had heard about school districts having car parades, and with some club events canceled this summer, she thought they could do the same thing but with their boats. People living on the lake were able to come out to their pier and watch, celebrating the graduates.</p>\n\n<p>Club commodore <person>Meredith Partridge</person> thought it was a great idea to help make up for students missing out.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've had three graduations in my life,\" Partridge said, \"and with (graduations) being canceled, I wanted them to get the recognition they deserved.\"</p>\n\n<p>The parade, which took place at the end of May, was open to and had graduates of all ages, and anyone was able to participate regardless of where they were from. For health safety, people who participated needed to own boat or to borrow from someone they knew.</p>\n\n<p>In all, 12 boats participated, a better turnout than Partridge expected.</p>\n\n<p>Participants wore their caps and gowns on their boats, which were decorated with \"congratulations\" signs and flags for their respective schools, as they made their way all around <location>Powers Lake</location> as \"Pomp and Circumstance\" played from a pier.</p>\n\n<p><person>Jill Smart</person> said each year the club has its own parade where members decorate their boats, something that helped inspire her idea.</p>\n\n<p>Partridge and <person>Jill Smart</person> both thought the parade for graduates was a great success.</p>\n\n<p>\"When we saw people running out of their houses to watch, we thought maybe it was better than a regular graduation ceremony,\" <person>Jill Smart</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, <person>Jill Smart</person> said many of the parents from the boats connected, talking about their children's graduations and futures.</p>\n\n<p>The students enjoyed the parade, too, getting an opportunity to celebrate their accomplishments.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think it compensated for a big part of what we missed out on, especially for the college kids,\" <person>Douglas Smart</person> said. \"College students expect a big celebration and getting to share it with their whole family. The boat parade was actually more fun than the commencement would've been.\"</p>\n\n<p>IN PHOTOS: Congrats to the Class of 2020The Class of 2020 is unique in many ways and its graduation is just one of them. Changes due to social distancing, online ceremonies and more make this a spring of altogether different ways of celebrating.</p>",
