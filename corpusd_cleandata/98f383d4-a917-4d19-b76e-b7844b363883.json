    "text": "Herself a senior citizen, Finance Undersecretary Maria \"Tere\" Teresa Habitan\nin her FB post Tuesday questioned the rationale behind the decision of the\nIATF to restrict the movement of individuals belonging to this age category.\n\nMs. Tere argued that senior citizens are neither impulsive nor capricious.\n\"Senior citizens have a mind of their own. It doesn't mean we grow old, we\nlost our sense. May isip naman ang mga senior citizens. Palagay ko, isang\nhindi nasusulat na sintomas nitong virus na ito ay ang pagkawala sa wisyo ng\nmga gumagawa ng panuntunan para sa mga nakararami.\"\n\nShe was reacting to the back stories of a senior citizen who went out of her\nhouse, walked more than she could physically handle to the MRT station but was\nbarred from boarding. \"It is not because of whims that she wants to go out\n(maglakwatsa). She has to buy medicine for maintenance and food for\nsustenance.\"\n\nThis was one of the back story that happened during the first day of the shift\nfrom ECQ to GCQ. In my part of the metropolis at the heart of the Central\nBusiness District (CDB) of Makati, it seems like the behavioral pattern is\nsubdued, the transition protocol laid out by the authorities is really being\nfollowed.\n\nThe streets surrounding CBD remain relatively calm with only a number of\nvehicles traversing the routes, far from my expectation that it would be back\nto at least moderate traffic. The reason is half of the Makati workforce still\nis in working from home, while others have to undergo testing before they can\nphysically report for work.\n\nStill others are trying to work out a travel permit that would allow them to\ncross borders from LGU to another LGU. A government official has said Metro\nManila is borderless. Cambridge defines borderless as a situation in which the\nborder between two locations is not important, usually in relation to the\nmovement of goods and people.\n\nThis brings me back to the issue raised by Usec Tere on the restraining,\nprohibitive, teetering on the virtual imprisonment of senior citizens by\npreventing them from going out. Like her, I beg to differ on the decision of\nthe IATF to impose this restrictive ruling. The ruling preventing able-bodied\nsenior citizen, 60 years old and up, from going out is bordering on over-\nzealousness.\n\nI fully comprehend where the state is coming from - they're trying to protect\nthis particular sector of society which has been categorized as most\nvulnerable to the health menace.\n\nUndersecretary Tere, however, states that \"older adults and people\" not\nnecessary senior citizens \"who have been severe underlying medical conditions\nlike heart or lung ailment, diabetes\" are at high risk for \"developing more\nserious complications from COVD-19 illness.\n\nThe facts on the ground, though, showed us that some of those who were\nstranded on the streets due to the sheer lack of transportation at the onset\nof easing were senior citizens. They're undaunted that the heath danger\nexists. Their focus was simply to eke-out a living for their daily needs.\n\nIndividuals in this age category are either the head honchos of their own\nbusinesses, retired but are into consulting business, and they just don't\nventure out of their abode on sheer whims.\n\nThe bill of rights is enshrined in Article 111 of the Constitutions. Section 6\nunder the Bill of Rights states that the right to travel shall not be impaired\nexcept in the interest of national security, public safety, or public health,\nas may provided by law.\n\nI wonder what's the stance of election lawyer Atty. Romulo Makalintal, an\nadvocate in protecting the rights of senior citizen\n\nTalkback to me at [sionil731@gmail.com](mailto:sionil731@gmail.com)\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nFil C. Sionil",

    "html": "<p>Herself a senior citizen, Finance Undersecretary Maria\n\"Tere\" Teresa Habitan in her FB post Tuesday questioned the\nrationale behind the decision of the IATF to restrict the movement of\nindividuals belonging to this age category.</p>\n\n<p><person>Ms. Tere</person> argued that senior citizens are neither impulsive nor\ncapricious. \"Senior citizens have a mind of their own. It\ndoesn't mean we grow old, we lost our sense. May isip naman ang mga\nsenior citizens. Palagay ko, isang hindi nasusulat na sintomas nitong\nvirus na ito ay ang pagkawala sa wisyo ng mga gumagawa ng panuntunan\npara sa mga nakararami.\"</p>\n\n<p>She was reacting to the back stories of a senior citizen who went\nout of her house, walked more than she could physically handle to the\nMRT station but was barred from boarding. \"It is not because of\nwhims that she wants to go out (maglakwatsa). She has to buy medicine\nfor maintenance and food for sustenance.\"</p>\n\n<p>This was one of the back story that happened during the first day\nof the shift from ECQ to GCQ. In my part of the metropolis at the heart\nof the <location>Central Business District</location> (CDB) of Makati, it seems like the\nbehavioral pattern is subdued, the transition protocol laid out by the\nauthorities is really being followed.</p>\n\n<p>The streets surrounding CBD remain relatively calm with only a\nnumber of vehicles traversing the routes, far from my expectation that\nit would be back to at least moderate traffic. The reason is half of the\nMakati workforce still is in working from home, while others have to\nundergo testing before they can physically report for work.</p>\n\n<p>Still others are trying to work out a travel permit that would\nallow them to cross borders from LGU to another LGU. A government\nofficial has said Metro Manila is borderless. Cambridge defines\nborderless as a situation in which the border between two locations is\nnot important, usually in relation to the movement of goods and people.</p>\n\n<p>This brings me back to the issue raised by Usec Tere on the\nrestraining, prohibitive, teetering on the virtual imprisonment of\nsenior citizens by preventing them from going out. Like her, I beg to\ndiffer on the decision of the IATF to impose this restrictive ruling.\nThe ruling preventing able-bodied senior citizen, 60 years old and up,\nfrom going out is bordering on over-zealousness.</p>\n\n<p>I fully comprehend where the state is coming from - they're\ntrying to protect this particular sector of society which has been\ncategorized as most vulnerable to the health menace.</p>\n\n<p>Undersecretary Tere, however, states that \"older adults and\npeople\" not necessary senior citizens \"who have been severe\nunderlying medical conditions like heart or lung ailment, diabetes\"\nare at high risk for \"developing more serious complications from\nCOVD-19 illness.</p>\n\n<p>The facts on the ground, though, showed us that some of those who\nwere stranded on the streets due to the sheer lack of transportation at\nthe onset of easing were senior citizens. They're undaunted that\nthe heath danger exists. Their focus was simply to eke-out a living for\ntheir daily needs.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals in this age category are either the head honchos of\ntheir own businesses, retired but are into consulting business, and they\njust don't venture out of their abode on sheer whims.</p>\n\n<p>The bill of rights is enshrined in Article 111 of the\nConstitutions. Section 6 under the Bill of Rights states that the right\nto travel shall not be impaired except in the interest of national\nsecurity, public safety, or public health, as may provided by law.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder what's the stance of election lawyer Atty. <person>Romulo\nMakalintal</person>, an advocate in protecting the rights of senior citizen</p>\n\n<p>Talkback to me at <a href=\"mailto:sionil731@gmail.com\">sionil731@gmail.com</a></p>\n\n<p>CAPTION(S):</p>\n\n<p>Fil C.
