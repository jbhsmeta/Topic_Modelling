    "text": "Hong Kong, June 5 (ANI): Streets and parks of Hong Kong were illuminated with\ncandlelight as tens of thousands of people defied coronavirus restrictions on\ngatherings to commemorate the 31st anniversary of China's Tiananmen Square\nmassacre on Thursday night, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nThe annual vigil carried new significance on Thursday as Hong Kong people\nremembered not only the hundreds, and possibly thousands, killed when Chinese\nsoldiers cracked down on pro-democracy in Beijing on June 4, 1989, but also\nlooked ahead to a new national security law that China plans to impose and\ncritics say will threaten Hong Kong's civil liberties.\n\nOn early Thursday evening, however, hundreds and then thousands of people\ndefied the order, as well as signs and fences around Victoria Park, to occupy\ntwo large football pitches where the rally has been traditionally held.\n\nSeveral thousand people, many clad in black, joined the rally after breaking\nthrough barriers that sealed off the area. They held signs and chanted slogans\nlike \"liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\" and \"fight for freedom,\nstand with Hong Kong\".\n\nLee Cheuk-yan, an organizer and former lawmaker, led the crowd in chants of\n\"end one-party rule,\" and \"democracy for China!\"\n\nAs per CNN's report, others chanted slogans from last year's anti-government\nprotests, including \"fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\" and a more\nrecent refrain, \"Hong Kong independence, the only way out.\"\n\nThose slogans could be illegal in the near future, as Beijing moves to impose\na national security law banning sedition, secession and separatism. Similar\nlaws have been used to crack down on dissidents and pro-democracy activists in\nChina.\n\nHong Kong has long been the only place to hold a mass commemoration of the\nJune 4 crackdown over which mainland authorities do not allow any open\ndiscussion and censors remove any mention of it from the Internet.\n\nThat national security law which Beijing has said is necessary to prevent the\ntype of violent unrest seen last year is currently being drafted by China and\nwill be imposed automatically in Hong Kong via a rarely used constitutional\nbackdoor, bypassing the city's legislature.\n\nThe Hong Kong city police had responded to earlier protests with overwhelming\nnumbers and used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse several gatherings in\nrecent weeks. But on Thursday, there was a complete reversal in tactics, as\npolice stayed largely out of sight as several thousand people ignored fences\nand signs to gather illegally in Victoria Park.\n\nThe next major test, of both the pro-democracy movement and the authorities,\nwill come as early as next week, which sees two key anniversaries of last\nyear's protest movement.\n\nAbout 1 million people marched against an extradition bill with China on June\n9, 2019, while three days later, protesters blockaded the city's legislature\nand clashed with police to prevent the law being passed. It was eventually\nwithdrawn in September 2019, by which point the anti-government movement had\ngrown substantially, with its goals expanded beyond a single bill. (ANI)",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location>, <chron>June 5</chron> (ANI): Streets and parks of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> were illuminated with candlelight as tens of thousands of people defied coronavirus restrictions on gatherings to commemorate the 31st anniversary of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location> <location>Tiananmen Square</location> massacre on Thursday night, <org>Al Jazeera</org> reported.</p>\n<p>The annual vigil carried new significance on Thursday as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> people remembered not only the hundreds, and possibly thousands, killed when Chinese soldiers cracked down on pro-democracy in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location> on <chron>June 4, 1989</chron>, but also looked ahead to a new national security law that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> plans to impose and critics say will threaten <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong's</location> civil liberties.</p>\n<p>On early Thursday evening, however, hundreds and then thousands of people defied the order, as well as signs and fences around <location>Victoria Park</location>, to occupy two large football pitches where the rally has been traditionally held.</p>\n<p>Several thousand people, many clad in black, joined the rally after breaking through barriers that sealed off the area. They held signs and chanted slogans like \"liberate <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location>, the revolution of our time\" and \"fight for freedom, stand with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location>\".</p>\n<p><person>Lee Cheuk</person>-yan, an organizer and former lawmaker, led the crowd in chants of \"end one-party rule,\" and \"democracy for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>!\"</p>\n<p>As per <org>CNN's</org> report, others chanted slogans from last year's anti-government protests, including \"fight for freedom, stand with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location>,\" and a more recent refrain, \"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> independence, the only way out.\"</p>\n<p>Those slogans could be illegal in the near future, as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location> moves to impose a national security law banning sedition, secession and separatism. Similar laws have been used to crack down on dissidents and pro-democracy activists in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> has long been the only place to hold a mass commemoration of the <chron>June 4</chron> crackdown over which mainland authorities do not allow any open discussion and censors remove any mention of it from the Internet.</p>\n<p>That national security law which <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location> has said is necessary to prevent the type of violent unrest seen last year is currently being drafted by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and will be imposed automatically in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> via a rarely used constitutional backdoor, bypassing the city's legislature.</p>\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> city police had responded to earlier protests with overwhelming numbers and used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse several gatherings in recent weeks. But on Thursday, there was a complete reversal in tactics, as police stayed largely out of sight as several thousand people ignored fences and signs to gather illegally in <location>Victoria Park</location>.</p>\n<p>The next major test, of both the pro-democracy movement and the authorities, will come as early as next week, which sees two key anniversaries of last year's protest movement.</p>\n<p>About 1 million people marched against an extradition bill with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> on <chron>June 9, 2019</chron>, while three days later, protesters blockaded the city's legislature and clashed with police to prevent the law being passed. It was eventually withdrawn in <chron>September 2019</chron>, by which point the anti-government movement had grown substantially, with its goals expanded beyond a single bill. (ANI)</p>",
