    "text": "Fair Warning\n\nBy Michael Connelly, via Little, Brown and Co.\n\nJack McEvoy has come a long way from his days as an investigative reporter on\na big-city newspaper. The veteran crime reporter who solved murders in Michael\nConnelly's earlier books \"The Scarecrow\" and \"The Poet\" is now working for a\nwatchdog website called FairWarning. His skills go to uncovering scam artists\nand consumer fraud.\n\nHe still longs for the big crime story, however, and when a murder\ninvestigation falls into his lap, Jack grabs it. Or rather, it grabs him.\n\nTwo cops show up at his apartment to question him about a woman whose neck was\nbroken in a sort of whiplash fashion called atlantooccipital dislocation. The\ndeath looks like an accident, but the detectives are suspicious, and they\nconsider Jack a suspect because he'd had a one-night stand with the woman\nsometime back. Jack decides to look into the murder on his own and tracks down\nthe victim's friend, who tells him the dead woman, who frequented bars for sex\npartners, had met a man who seemed to know things about her. She'd bolted.\n\nIntrigued, Jack digs a little deeper, although murder isn't a subject for\nFairWarning. He discovers that other women had died of atlantooccipital\ndislocation, the deaths staged to look like accidents. What links the women\ntogether is that all of them had signed up for a DNA site called GT23. Jack\nbelieves they were victims of cyberstalking and convinces his skeptical editor\nthat this indeed is a FairWarning story.\n\nAs he delves into the world of DNA testing and analytical companies, Jack\nfinds they are barely regulated. GT23 charges users only $23, explaining in\nthe fine print in its contracts that the low fee is possible because the\ncompany sells data to various users. It doesn't disclose that such companies\nsometimes resell the information. It's all supposed to be anonymous of course,\nonly it isn't. Data buyers have ways of identifying the participants.\n\nThat's what one small firm has done by buying data on DRD4 or \"dirty four\"\nwomen - those with an addiction gene. Addiction includes not only alcohol and\ndrugs but also sex. Their names and addresses are sold to incel (involuntary\ncelibate) men, who blame women for their inability to find sex partners. One\nof these women-haters is a killer known as the Shrike. And it was the Shrike\nwho murdered Jack's acquaintance.\n\nJack needs to profile the Shrike and brings in - you guessed it - his on-\nagain-off-again paramour, former FBI agent Rachel Walling. The two haven't\nseen each other since Rachel was fired two years short of being vested for\nleaking confidential information to Jack. She now runs her own background\ninvestigation company. Against her better judgment, Rachel joins Jack - and\nEmily, a second reporter assigned to the story - and the two pick up\nprofessionally as well as personally. No big surprise that both women are in\ndanger, and of course, Jack is, too. The Shrike is one of Connelly's more\nvicious villains.\n\n\"Fair Warning\" sheds light on the murky billion-dollar world of DNA testing.\nThe Federal Trade Commission originally had oversight of the industry until it\ngot too big and turned responsibility over to the Federal Drug Administration,\nwhich does little in the way of oversight or enforcement. Labs are licensed\nbut essentially operate on their own. All that makes the subject ripe for a\ngood mystery.\n\nAnd Michael Connelly is just the guy to write it. Score another one for the\ndean of America's crime writers.",

    "html": "<p><person>Fair Warning</person></p>\n<p>By <person>Michael Connelly</person>, via <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1517581529\">Little, Brown and Co.</org></p>\n\n<p><person>Jack McEvoy</person> has come a long way from his days as an investigative reporter on a big-city newspaper. The veteran crime reporter who solved murders in <person>Michael Connelly's</person> earlier books \"The Scarecrow\" and \"The Poet\" is now working for a watchdog website called FairWarning. His skills go to uncovering scam artists and consumer fraud.</p>\n\n<p>He still longs for the big crime story, however, and when a murder investigation falls into his lap, Jack grabs it. Or rather, it grabs him.</p>\n\n<p>Two cops show up at his apartment to question him about a woman whose neck was broken in a sort of whiplash fashion called atlantooccipital dislocation. The death looks like an accident, but the detectives are suspicious, and they consider Jack a suspect because he'd had a one-night stand with the woman sometime back. Jack decides to look into the murder on his own and tracks down the victim's friend, who tells him the dead woman, who frequented bars for sex partners, had met a man who seemed to know things about her. She'd bolted.</p>\n\n<p>Intrigued, Jack digs a little deeper, although murder isn't a subject for FairWarning. He discovers that other women had died of atlantooccipital dislocation, the deaths staged to look like accidents. What links the women together is that all of them had signed up for a DNA site called GT23. Jack believes they were victims of cyberstalking and convinces his skeptical editor that this indeed is a FairWarning story.</p>\n\n<p>As he delves into the world of DNA testing and analytical companies, Jack finds they are barely regulated. GT23 charges users only <money>$23</money>, explaining in the fine print in its contracts that the low fee is possible because the company sells data to various users. It doesn't disclose that such companies sometimes resell the information. It's all supposed to be anonymous of course, only it isn't. Data buyers have ways of identifying the participants.</p>\n\n<p>That's what one small firm has done by buying data on DRD4 or \"dirty four\" women - those with an addiction gene. Addiction includes not only alcohol and drugs but also sex. Their names and addresses are sold to incel (involuntary celibate) men, who blame women for their inability to find sex partners. One of these women-haters is a killer known as the Shrike. And it was the Shrike who murdered Jack's acquaintance.</p>\n\n<p>Jack needs to profile the Shrike and brings in - you guessed it - his on-again-off-again paramour, former FBI agent <person>Rachel Walling</person>. The two haven't seen each other since Rachel was fired two years short of being vested for leaking confidential information to Jack. She now runs her own background investigation company. Against her better judgment, Rachel joins Jack - and Emily, a second reporter assigned to the story - and the two pick up professionally as well as personally. No big surprise that both women are in danger, and of course, Jack is, too. The Shrike is one of Connelly's more vicious villains.</p>\n\n<p>\"Fair Warning\" sheds light on the murky billion-dollar world of DNA testing. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2373566280\">Federal Trade Commission</org> originally had oversight of the industry until it got too big and turned responsibility over to the <org>Federal Drug Administration</org>, which does little in the way of oversight or enforcement. Labs are licensed but essentially operate on their own. All that makes the subject ripe for a good mystery.</p>\n\n<p>And <person>Michael Connelly</person> is just the guy to write it. Score another one for the dean of America's crime writers.</p>",
