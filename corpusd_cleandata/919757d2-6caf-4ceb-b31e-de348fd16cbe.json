Samuel has confirmed its Wisbech branch at the Horsefair will not reopen\nwhen coronavirus lockdown measures are eased this month.\n\nIn an email, a spokesman for Signet Group of jewellery retailers which owns\nH.Samuel, said: \"Yes, our H.Samuel store in Wisbech is closing.\n\n\"The Referral Store for customers is H.Samuel in King's Lynn, 70 High Street,\nKings' Lynn, PE30 1AY (14 miles away).\"\n\nHe added: \"This store [King's Lynn] is yet to reopen since it was temporarily\nclosed in late March, however, we are planning to open it on June 15.\"\n\nCustomers who had ordered or left items for repair at the Wisbech store are\nbeing contacted individually about next steps.\n\nThe spokesman explained it is looking to launch a new online shopping service\nafter a 'Live Advice' feature was introduced to the Ernest Jones website, a\nsister brand.\n\nThe spokesman's email said: \"This will enable our online customers to continue\nto receive 5* customer service and have the in-store experience from the\ncomfort and safety of their very own homes.\"\n\nIt continued: \"Our customers can also continue to shop with H. Samuel online\nat [www.hsamuel.co.uk](http://www.hsamuel.co.uk).\"\n\nBut both H.Samuel and Ernest Jones websites have been \"experiencing technical\ndifficulties\" this morning.\n\nH.Samuel was founded in 1962. The branch in Wisbech, located opposite Costa\nclose to the Horsefair's Market Place entrance, has been a feature of the\nshopping centre which first opened in 1988.\n\nThe Horsefair Shopping Centre has been approached for comment.\n\nNon-essential shops across the country - including department stores, high\nstreet shops and shopping centres - are due to reopen on June 15 as part of\nthe government's plan to ease the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nRetailers must be able to prove their premises are 'COVID-secure before they\ncan allow customers to enter.",

The branch in Wisbech, located opposite Costa close to the Horsefair&#8217;s <location>Market Place</location> entrance, has been a feature of the shopping centre which first opened in 1988. </p>\n<p><location>The Horsefair Shopping Centre</location> has been approached for comment.</p>\n<p>Non-essential shops across the country - including department stores, high street shops and shopping centres - are due to reopen on <chron>June 15</chron> as part of the government&#8217;s plan to ease the coronavirus lockdown. </p>\n<p>Retailers must be able to prove their premises are &#8216;COVID-secure before they can allow customers to enter.</p>",
