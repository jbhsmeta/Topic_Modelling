    "text": "Caulfield chief slams Racing Victoria for 'gutless' call on carnival Melbourne\nRacing Club chairman Peter Le Grand has slammed Racing Victoria and accused\nits board of being \"gutless\", \"weak\" and reluctant to take any risks after the\nsporting body knocked back a proposal to radically change the spring carnival.\nLe Grand unleashed a barrage of criticism at RV's administrators, saying they\nlacked imagination for refusing to countenance a revolutionary revamp of the\ntraditional carnival dates. However, the club's chief executive, Josh\nBlanksby, has vowed to try again next year, believing racing has an\nopportunity to own vacant sporting calendar space in late November. Le Grand\ndid not hold back in a radio interview aired just minutes after RV chairman\nBrian Kruger announced via the industry-owned [racing.com](http://racing.com)\nthat his board had voted unanimously to \"effectively leave the dates as they\nhave been traditionally\". The MRC was proposing to move its Caulfield Cup and\nGuineas features to the back end of November to avoid a clash with AFL finals\nand to give its members a greater chance of attending the races. \"Another weak\ndecision, totally predictable, gutless position as far as I'm concerned,\" Le\nGrand said on SEN. \"Here was an opportunity to be different in racing, to be\ninnovative and try something different. There's absolutely no innovation\ncoming out of RVL. \"Fair dinkum, I'm nearly speechless. I can't believe it.\nHere was an opportunity in COVID-19 times to put it back a month, give people\nand members a chance to get the races in better weather, and what do we do?\nJust keep on going the way you're going, don't change anything, just go along\nwith what we've been doing the last hundred years.\" Kruger said RV had\nundergone a six-week process \"at least\" to explore how a revamped program\nmight have looked, in order to avoid a clash with AFL finals and give the\nsport a better chance at hosting crowds. However, he said any potential upside\nto overhauling its time-honoured carnival were uncertain enough \"to warrant\nmaking such a significant change\". \"The spring racing carnival has been so\nsuccessful, it really is a global icon and we felt in order to consider making\nchanges, even in this COVID-effected world, there really needed to be some\ncompelling reasons for us to do that,\" Kruger said. Blanksby said the MRC\nwould \"absolutely\" look at the proposal for next year's spring. \"We put this\nup because we feel that's a period of the sporting calendar that's vacant,\" he\nsaid. \"There's better weather and racing can have that chance to absolutely\nown that space. It's been a really positive debate, the pros and cons, so\nwe'll monitor how [wagering] results go this spring \u2026 and then see how it\ngoes.\" Blanksby added he would ask RV for its wagering analysis after Kruger\nsaid bookmakers were split on whether a November spring carnival would\nmaterially improve the sport's wagering income. The Victoria Racing Club has\nbeen adamant the Melbourne Cup carnival and its traditional first Tuesday in\nNovember date is sacrosanct and would not be moving. Moonee Valley Racing Club\nhad opted to stay in its traditional late October space too, with every\nlikelihood that the Cox Plate will now be an afternoon hors d'oeuvres for a\nnight AFL grand final on October 24. VRC chief executive Neil Wilson said it\nwas \"good to have clarity\". \"We were not opposed to it [running the Caulfield\nCup later in the year] but we know the programme as is, is a model that\nworks,\" he said. Moonee Valley boss Michael Browell said: \"the club was\nwilling to consider both options. We now retain the two-day carnival, Friday\nnight with the Manikato as the headline and the 100th running of the Cox Plate\non the Saturday. \"We are happy to retain the traditional carnival format but\nwere equally as happy to consider the one-off change this year, to accommodate\nthe MRC's request in light of the impact of COVID.\" RV has, however, decided\nto move the Underwood Stakes - which is traditionally held on the Sunday after\nthe AFL grand final - back to a Saturday meeting, while confirming the\npreferred race time for the October 24 Cox Plate was during the day.",

    "title": "Caulfield chief slams Racing Victoria for 'gutless' call on carnival [Brisbane Times (Australia)]",
    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.caueld\">Caulfield</location> chief slams Racing Victoria for 'gutless' call on carnival <org>Melbourne Racing Club</org> chairman <person>Peter Le Grand</person> has slammed Racing Victoria and accused its board of being \"gutless\", \"weak\" and reluctant to take any risks after the sporting body knocked back a proposal to radically change the spring carnival. Le Grand unleashed a barrage of criticism at RV's administrators, saying they lacked imagination for refusing to countenance a revolutionary revamp of the traditional carnival dates. However, the club's chief executive, <person>Josh Blanksby</person>, has vowed to try again next year, believing racing has an opportunity to own vacant sporting calendar space in late November. Le Grand did not hold back in a radio interview aired just minutes after RV chairman <person>Brian Kruger</person> announced via the industry-owned <a href=\"http://racing.com\">racing.com</a> that his board had voted unanimously to \"effectively leave the dates as they have been traditionally\". The MRC was proposing to move its Caulfield Cup and Guineas features to the back end of November to avoid a clash with <org>AFL</org> finals and to give its members a greater chance of attending the races. \"Another weak decision, totally predictable, gutless position as far as I'm concerned,\" Le Grand said on SEN. \"Here was an opportunity to be different in racing, to be innovative and try something different. There's absolutely no innovation coming out of RVL. \"Fair dinkum, I'm nearly speechless. I can't believe it. Here was an opportunity in COVID-19 times to put it back a month, give people and members a chance to get the races in better weather, and what do we do? Just keep on going the way you're going, don't change anything, just go along with what we've been doing the last hundred years.\" Kruger said RV had undergone a six-week process \"at least\" to explore how a revamped program might have looked, in order to avoid a clash with <org>AFL</org> finals and give the sport a better chance at hosting crowds. However, he said any potential upside to overhauling its time-honoured carnival were uncertain enough \"to warrant making such a significant change\". \"The spring racing carnival has been so successful, it really is a global icon and we felt in order to consider making changes, even in this COVID-effected world, there really needed to be some compelling reasons for us to do that,\" Kruger said. Blanksby said the MRC would \"absolutely\" look at the proposal for next year's spring. \"We put this up because we feel that's a period of the sporting calendar that's vacant,\" he said. \"There's better weather and racing can have that chance to absolutely own that space. It's been a really positive debate, the pros and cons, so we'll monitor how [wagering] results go this spring &#8230; and then see how it goes.\" Blanksby added he would ask RV for its wagering analysis after Kruger said bookmakers were split on whether a November spring carnival would materially improve the sport's wagering income. <org>The Victoria Racing Club</org> has been adamant the Melbourne Cup carnival and its traditional first Tuesday in November date is sacrosanct and would not be moving. <org>Moonee Valley Racing Club</org> had opted to stay in its traditional late October space too, with every likelihood that the Cox Plate will now be an afternoon hors d'oeuvres for a night <org>AFL</org> grand final on <chron>October 24</chron>. VRC chief executive <person>Neil Wilson</person> said it was \"good to have clarity\". \"We were not opposed to it [running the Caulfield Cup later in the year] but we know the programme as is, is a model that works,\" he said. <location>Moonee Valley</location> boss <person>Michael Browell</person> said: \"the club was willing to consider both options. We now retain the two-day carnival, Friday night with the Manikato as the headline and the 100th running of the Cox Plate on the Saturday. \"We are happy to retain the traditional carnival format but were equally as happy to consider the one-off change this year, to accommodate the MRC's request in light of the impact of COVID.\" RV has, however, decided to move the Underwood Stakes - which is traditionally held on the Sunday after the <org>AFL</org> grand final - back to a Saturday meeting, while confirming the preferred race time for the <chron>October 24</chron> Cox Plate was during the day.</p>",
