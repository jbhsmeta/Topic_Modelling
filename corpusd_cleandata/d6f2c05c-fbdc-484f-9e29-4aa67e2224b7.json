    "text": "Multiple trips down the shore over the last two weeks brought back a dozen new\ncoronavirus cases in Bucks County, health officials say.\n\nEleven of the county's 33 new cases reported Saturday evening were linked to\none New Jersey resident who contracted the virus at a beach house gathering\nrecently, a county news release states.\n\nSome of those 11 people came into contact with that person while they also\nvisited the shore, then spread the highly contagious virus to several others\nwhen they returned.\n\nCounty Health Department Director Dr. David Damsker said the new cases\nhighlight the importance of caution as the county was only a day into the\nsecond phase of the state's reopening plan.\n\n\"This is exactly why we can't let our guard down now, even if it feels 'safe'\nto be at the beach,\" Damsker said Saturday.\n\nAnother previously identified patient in Bucks County was also linked to the\nsame New Jersey resident as the county worked on tracing the source of the 11\nnew cases.\n\nThe county has not released the specific area of the shore the new patients\nwere visiting for confidentiality reasons.\n\n\"One unlucky exposure can lead to a large cascade of cases down the line. We\nwant everyone to enjoy the warmer weather and have fun, but let's keep in mind\nthat COVID is still circulating in the community at baseline levels,\" Damsker\nadded.\n\nNew Jersey beaches reopened late last month.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the three-phased, color-coded reopening plan was announced in\nlate April, a plan Gov. Tom Wolf said would be guided by new cases, hospital\ncapacity and other factors.\n\nMost counties moved out of the initial red phase and into the yellow phase\nthrough May, but Bucks, Montgomery and several other southeastern counties\nremained in the red phase until Friday.\n\nThe yellow phase of reopening lifts stay-at-home orders and allowed certain\nbusinesses to reopen where direct contact between customers and employees\ncould be avoided.\n\nYet state and local health officials warned against the possibility of\nbacksliding into the red should spikes in cases be seen.\n\nNew cases reported in both the state and the county have been on a general\ndownward trend in recent weeks, with most new cases occurring in nursing home\nresidents and staff, or in health care workers.\n\nState Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle echoed past comments from\nWolf and Health Secretary Dr. Levine to residents that the yellow phase should\nbe treated as a cautionary step forward.\n\n\"... this is the type of concerning development that we will see as people\n(increase) their interactions with the stay-at-home order lifted,\" Department\nof Health spokesman Nate Wardle said in an email Monday.\n\n\"We need people to continue to wear masks, to continue to maintain social\ndistancing and to take precautions as they travel out,\" Wardle added.\n\nBased on past statements from the state, a spike in cases alone would not take\nBucks or other counties into the red again.\n\nMoving between phases has depended on multiple factors, one of the biggest\nconcerns being how a county's healthcare system can respond to an outbreak in\nnew cases.\n\nAn uptick in coronavirus cases could be coming in the near future as Wolf\nannounced Monday morning a universal testing mandate for nursing homes and\nlong-term care facilities.\n\nThe order requires nursing homes to test all residents and employees\nregardless of symptoms.\n\n\"We are working tirelessly to include all long-term care facilities in this\nstrategy as soon as possible,\" Levine said in a Monday news release.\n\nThe state health department estimates 615 facilities across the state have\nseen cases of the virus in over 16,000 residents and over 2,800 employees as\nof Monday.\n\nNearly 70% of the state's 5,953 coronavirus-related deaths have been related\nto infections in nursing homes.\n\nThe state issued a pilot program between May 11 and May 26 implementing\nuniversal testing in five facilities across the state.\n\nAt least 75 facilities have also performed universal testing that has\nultimately seen the percentage of infected lower.\n\nThe state will be taking requests for testing supplies directly from nursing\nhomes, which will have until July 24 to complete the testing.\n\n\"At this point, we are able to successfully expand testing and support to all\nstaff and residents to further protect those in nursing homes across\nPennsylvania,\" Levine added.\n\nAs of Monday, almost 76,000 people in Pennsylvania are estimated to have\ncontracted coronavirus since March 6.",

    "html": "<p>Multiple trips down the shore over the last two weeks brought back a dozen new coronavirus cases in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.bucks\">Bucks County</location>, health officials say.</p>\n<p>Eleven of the county's 33 new cases reported Saturday evening were linked to one <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> resident who contracted the virus at a beach house gathering recently, a county news release states.</p>\n\n<p>Some of those 11 people came into contact with that person while they also visited the shore, then spread the highly contagious virus to several others when they returned.</p>\n\n<p><org>County Health Department</org> Director Dr. <person>David Damsker</person> said the new cases highlight the importance of caution as the county was only a day into the second phase of the state's reopening plan.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is exactly why we can't let our guard down now, even if it feels 'safe' to be at the beach,\" Damsker said Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>Another previously identified patient in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.bucks\">Bucks County</location> was also linked to the same <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> resident as the county worked on tracing the source of the 11 new cases.</p>\n\n<p>The county has not released the specific area of the shore the new patients were visiting for confidentiality reasons.</p>\n\n<p>\"One unlucky exposure can lead to a large cascade of cases down the line. We want everyone to enjoy the warmer weather and have fun, but let's keep in mind that COVID is still circulating in the community at baseline levels,\" Damsker added.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> beaches reopened late last month.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location>, the three-phased, color-coded reopening plan was announced in late April, a plan Gov. <person>Tom Wolf</person> said would be guided by new cases, hospital capacity and other factors.</p>\n\n<p>Most counties moved out of the initial red phase and into the yellow phase through May, but <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.bucks\">Bucks</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.monery\">Montgomery</location> and several other southeastern counties remained in the red phase until Friday.</p>\n\n<p>The yellow phase of reopening lifts stay-at-home orders and allowed certain businesses to reopen where direct contact between customers and employees could be avoided.</p>\n\n<p>Yet state and local health officials warned against the possibility of backsliding into the red should spikes in cases be seen.</p>\n\n<p>New cases reported in both the state and the county have been on a general downward trend in recent weeks, with most new cases occurring in nursing home residents and staff, or in health care workers.</p>\n\n<p><org>State Department of Health</org> spokesman <person>Nate Wardle</person> echoed past comments from Wolf and Health Secretary <person>Dr. Levine</person> to residents that the yellow phase should be treated as a cautionary step forward.</p>\n\n<p>\"... this is the type of concerning development that we will see as people (increase) their interactions with the stay-at-home order lifted,\" <org>Department of Health</org> spokesman <person>Nate Wardle</person> said in an email Monday.</p>\n\n<p>\"We need people to continue to wear masks, to continue to maintain social distancing and to take precautions as they travel out,\" Wardle added.</p>\n\n<p>Based on past statements from the state, a spike in cases alone would not take <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.bucks\">Bucks</location> or other counties into the red again.</p>\n\n<p>Moving between phases has depended on multiple factors, one of the biggest concerns being how a county's healthcare system can respond to an outbreak in new cases.</p>\n\n<p>An uptick in coronavirus cases could be coming in the near future as Wolf announced Monday morning a universal testing mandate for nursing homes and long-term care facilities.</p>\n\n<p>The order requires nursing homes to test all residents and employees regardless of symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are working tirelessly to include all long-term care facilities in this strategy as soon as possible,\" Levine said in a Monday news release.</p>\n\n<p>The state health department estimates 615 facilities across the state have seen cases of the virus in over 16,000 residents and over 2,800 employees as of Monday.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 70% of the state's 5,953 coronavirus-related deaths have been related to infections in nursing homes.</p>\n\n<p>The state issued a pilot program <chron>between May 11 and May 26</chron> implementing universal testing in five facilities across the state.</p>\n\n<p>At least 75 facilities have also performed universal testing that has ultimately seen the percentage of infected lower.</p>\n\n<p>The state will be taking requests for testing supplies directly from nursing homes, which will have until <chron>July 24</chron> to complete the testing.</p>\n\n<p>\"At this point, we are able to successfully expand testing and support to all staff and residents to further protect those in nursing homes across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location>,\" Levine added.</p>\n\n<p>As of Monday, almost 76,000 people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location> are estimated to have contracted coronavirus since <chron>March 6</chron>.</p>",
