    "text": "Unquestionably, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected all aspects of\nour lives. In the business community, revenues, earnings and valuations have\nplummeted affecting governments, most businesses and individuals alike. As\nboth public and privately held companies search for additional debt capacity\nand/or potential buyers, the COVID-19 pandemic has and is affecting debt terms\nand availability, company valuations, and purchase prices paid for companies.\n\nAs a result of this current environment, a new financial metric for measuring\nfinancial performance has been created. It is called EBITDAC (Earnings Before\nInterest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, COVID-19) or Adjusted EBITDA.\nCompanies have always tried to flatter their financial performance and\nearnings by using various accounting treatments. So, creating a new financial\nperformance metric, EBITDAC, is no surprise. Currently, a great deal of\ndiscussion and controversy among the largest investment banks, accounting\nfirms and financial centers is being debated as to whether this new, non-GAAP\n(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) metric is appropriate during this\npandemic crisis.\n\nEBITDA discussion\n\nFor owners of privately held businesses seeking to sell their companies for\nthe most profit, it is critical that they understand the accounting principle.\nEBITDA is what some advisors call a pure measure of operating profits.\nInvestors looking to invest in or purchase a company, analyze and compare one\ncompany's EBITDA to another. The higher a company's EBITDA, the higher the\nvaluation of the company.\n\nThe EBITDA formula is simple. Start with the net income number, found on the\nIncome Statement, and add to it interest expenses, taxes (federal and state\nincome taxes only), depreciation and amortization. These add-backs increase\nthe profitability of the company's operating performance. EBITDA levels the\nplaying field when comparing companies because various companies will have\nmore or less in interest expense, depending on their debt levels. The same is\ntrue for taxes, depreciation and amortization because taxes vary substantially\nfrom one state to another and depreciation and amortization schedules vary as\nwell, depending on a company's capital purchases. Therefore, earnings can be\ndistorted from one company to another if the EBITDA formula is not applied\ncorrectly. It is important to remember that interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization are true operating expenses for any company.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA discussion\n\nMost company owners who are planning to sell their businesses should engage a\nprofessional Mergers and Acquisitions firm or an M&A consultant to help them\nrecast their past five years of Profit and Loss statements, balance sheets and\nthree to five years of proforma statements. This step is taken to provide\npotential buyers with both the synergies and potential future earnings of the\ncompany. Adding back any one-time only expenses, extraordinary expenses or\npersonal expenses paid by the company that are tangential to the company's\noperations will certainly add to the profitability of the company and to its\nvaluation. Some examples of add backs include:\n\n* Business disruption losses beyond your control (fire, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and tsunamis);\n\n* Extraordinary legal expenses due to a lawsuit;\n\n* Cars, boats, planes expensed through the business for personal use;\n\n* Memberships to country and yacht clubs and gyms for personal use;\n\n* Equipment replacement, repairs and renovations;\n\n* Owner's compensation or compensation to family member above market rates;\n\n* Payroll expensed through the company for inactive employees or children;\n\n* Travel vacations for you and your family that are not related to the business;\n\n* Losses due to employee embezzlement; and,\n\n* Payroll expenses including healthcare, life insurance and retirement for the owners.\n\nThese add backs are added to the EBITDA calculations and are labeled Adjusted\nEBITDA.\n\nEBITDAC discussion\n\nCertainly, the pandemic can be considered a business disruption, since most\nsmall and large businesses were near a total shutdown ordered by the\ngovernment. A strong argument can be made that significant profit losses would\nnot have occurred had it not been for the pandemic shutdown. The key is to\nprecisely identify earnings' losses that can be directly attributed to the\npandemic that would not have occurred had the pandemic not struck. Such\nexamples include, among others;\n\n* Supply chain interruptions;\n\n* Employee retention;\n\n* Loss of customer purchases that can be authenticated from past purchase behavior; and,\n\n* Loss of customer traffic due to \"stay at home\" orders.\n\nWhen examining the addition of the C to EBITDA, the earnings of the company\ncould be significantly increased. Remember, those companies that are reporting\nEBITDAC are adding back \"supposed\" or \"estimated\" earnings that never\nhappened. And, at best, the earnings add backs are anyone's estimates as to\nwhat they could have been. For example, this month Schenk Process, a German\nmeasuring instrument manufacturer owned by Blackstone, used this new\nperformance metric in its first quarter 2020 quarterly report. According to\nCovenant Review, a financial research firm, The Azek Company, a Chicago-based\nmanufacturer of building products, raised $325 million of junk bonds two weeks\nago. It used the term that would allow it to add back \"lost earnings\" as a\nresult of COVID-19. That was a first for the corporate debt market.\n\nThe problem is, how does anyone know what the true earnings might have been if\nCOVID-19 had not come about. By contrast, using the EBITDA formula without the\n\"C\", adds back expenses that really took place. There are no estimates or\nguesses. The added back expenses are taken directly from the company's income\nstatement for a specific reporting period.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile many businesses will never recover, many will; therefore, they will look\nto justify earning losses due to the effects of COVID-19 when trying to sell\ntheir companies. Whether they add the \"C\" to EBITDA or the \"C\" to the Adjusted\nEBITDA, it is critical that business owners gather data and documentation that\nwill strongly support this controversial accounting metric to persuade buyers\nthat their company's pre-pandemic valuation is the same as it will be post-\npandemic.\n\nGary Miller is CEO of GEM Strategy Management, Inc., a M&A consulting firm\nthat advises small and medium sized businesses throughout the U.S. He\nrepresents business owners throughout the transaction process from preparing\nthem to go to market, selling their companies, acquiring companies and raising\ncapital.

    "title": "Gary Miller: Companies valuing their businesses with a new performance metric during COVID-19",
    "html": "<p>Unquestionably, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected all aspects of our lives. In the business community, revenues, earnings and valuations have plummeted affecting governments, most businesses and individuals alike. As both public and privately held companies search for additional debt capacity and/or potential buyers, the COVID-19 pandemic has and is affecting debt terms and availability, company valuations, and purchase prices paid for companies.</p>\n<p>As a result of this current environment, a new financial metric for measuring financial performance has been created. It is called EBITDAC (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, COVID-19) or Adjusted EBITDA. Companies have always tried to flatter their financial performance and earnings by using various accounting treatments. So, creating a new financial performance metric, EBITDAC, is no surprise. Currently, a great deal of discussion and controversy among the largest investment banks, accounting firms and financial centers is being debated as to whether this new, non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) metric is appropriate during this pandemic crisis.</p>\n\n<p>EBITDA discussion</p>\n\n<p>For owners of privately held businesses seeking to sell their companies for the most profit, it is critical that they understand the accounting principle. EBITDA is what some advisors call a pure measure of operating profits. Investors looking to invest in or purchase a company, analyze and compare one company's EBITDA to another. The higher a company's EBITDA, the higher the valuation of the company.</p>\n\n<p>The EBITDA formula is simple. Start with the net income number, found on the Income Statement, and add to it interest expenses, taxes (federal and state income taxes only), depreciation and amortization. These add-backs increase the profitability of the company's operating performance. EBITDA levels the playing field when comparing companies because various companies will have more or less in interest expense, depending on their debt levels. The same is true for taxes, depreciation and amortization because taxes vary substantially from one state to another and depreciation and amortization schedules vary as well, depending on a company's capital purchases. Therefore, earnings can be distorted from one company to another if the EBITDA formula is not applied correctly. It is important to remember that interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are true operating expenses for any company.</p>\n\n<p>Adjusted EBITDA discussion</p>\n\n<p>Most company owners who are planning to sell their businesses should engage a professional Mergers and Acquisitions firm or an M&amp;A consultant to help them recast their past five years of Profit and Loss statements, balance sheets and three to five years of proforma statements. This step is taken to provide potential buyers with both the synergies and potential future earnings of the company. Adding back any one-time only expenses, extraordinary expenses or personal expenses paid by the company that are tangential to the company's operations will certainly add to the profitability of the company and to its valuation. Some examples of add backs include:</p>\n\n<p>* Business disruption losses beyond your control (fire, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and tsunamis);</p>\n\n<p>* Extraordinary legal expenses due to a lawsuit;</p>\n\n<p>* Cars, boats, planes expensed through the business for personal use;</p>\n\n<p>* Memberships to country and yacht clubs and gyms for personal use;</p>\n\n<p>* Equipment replacement, repairs and renovations;</p>\n\n<p>* Owner's compensation or compensation to family member above market rates;</p>\n\n<p>* Payroll expensed through the company for inactive employees or children;</p>\n\n<p>* Travel vacations for you and your family that are not related to the business;</p>\n\n<p>* Losses due to employee embezzlement; and,</p>\n\n<p>* Payroll expenses including healthcare, life insurance and retirement for the owners.</p>\n\n<p>These add backs are added to the EBITDA calculations and are labeled Adjusted EBITDA.</p>\n\n<p>EBITDAC discussion</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, the pandemic can be considered a business disruption, since most small and large businesses were near a total shutdown ordered by the government. A strong argument can be made that significant profit losses would not have occurred had it not been for the pandemic shutdown. The key is to precisely identify earnings' losses that can be directly attributed to the pandemic that would not have occurred had the pandemic not struck. Such examples include, among others;</p>\n\n<p>* Supply chain interruptions;</p>\n\n<p>* Employee retention;</p>\n\n<p>* Loss of customer purchases that can be authenticated from past purchase behavior; and,</p>\n\n<p>* Loss of customer traffic due to \"stay at home\" orders.</p>\n\n<p>When examining the addition of the C to EBITDA, the earnings of the company could be significantly increased. Remember, those companies that are reporting EBITDAC are adding back \"supposed\" or \"estimated\" earnings that never happened. And, at best, the earnings add backs are anyone's estimates as to what they could have been. For example, this month Schenk Process, a German measuring instrument manufacturer owned by <org>Blackstone</org>, used this new performance metric in its first quarter 2020 quarterly report. According to Covenant Review, a financial research firm, <org>The Azek Company</org>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>-based manufacturer of building products, raised <money>$325 million</money> of junk bonds two weeks ago. It used the term that would allow it to add back \"lost earnings\" as a result of COVID-19. That was a first for the corporate debt market.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, how does anyone know what the true earnings might have been if COVID-19 had not come about. By contrast, using the EBITDA formula without the \"C\", adds back expenses that really took place. There are no estimates or guesses. The added back expenses are taken directly from the company's income statement for a specific reporting period.</p>\n\n<p>Summary</p>\n\n<p>While many businesses will never recover, many will; therefore, they will look to justify earning losses due to the effects of COVID-19 when trying to sell their companies. Whether they add the \"C\" to EBITDA or the \"C\" to the Adjusted EBITDA, it is critical that business owners gather data and documentation that will strongly support this controversial accounting metric to persuade buyers that their company's pre-pandemic valuation is the same as it will be post-pandemic.</p>\n\n<p><person>Gary Miller</person> is CEO of <org>GEM Strategy Management, Inc.</org>, a M&amp;A consulting firm that advises small and medium sized businesses throughout the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> He represents business owners throughout the transaction process from preparing them to go to market, selling their companies, acquiring companies and raising capital.
