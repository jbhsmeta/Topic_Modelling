    "text": "Gov. Tony Evers announced his appointment of Mario White as Dane County\nCircuit Court judge. The appointment fills a vacancy created by Judge William\nHanrahans resignation. As the last week has shown, we need top-to-bottom\nchange in our criminal justice system to address its systemic racism, said\nGov. Evers. One of the ways we can do this is ensuring we have judges who\nunderstand and reflect the communities they serve. As a former teacher and\nhighly accomplished public defender, Mario White will do just that.\n\nWhite is currently a Dane County Court Commissioner, where he handles family,\ncriminal, and other proceedings. Between 2008 and 2018, White was an assistant\nstate public defender, representing individuals accused of crimes in Dane\nCounty. White also is an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law\nSchool, where he teaches courses on trial advocacy and coaches mock trial.\n\nMario White is a superb addition to the Dane County judiciary. White\nunderstands the role of a judge and understands the need for all who come\nbefore the court to be heard. He brings a wealth of knowledge, experience, and\nintegrity to the bench. We are confident that he will ensure justice for all,\nsaid Judges Rhonda L. Lanford and Ellen K. Berz.\n\nI am humbled and honored to be appointed to the Dane County bench by Governor\nEvers. The need for a compassionate, impartial, and independent judiciary has\nnever been greater. I look forward to bringing my perspective and experiences\nto the bench to ensure equal justice for all, said White. White graduated from\nthe University of Wisconsin Law School in 2008. He earned his undergraduate\ndegree from the Oklahoma State University. Prior to law school, White was a\nhigh school math teacher for three years in Dallas, Texas.",

    "html": "<p>Gov. <person>Tony Evers</person> announced his appointment of <person>Mario White</person> as <org>Dane County Circuit Court</org> judge. The appointment fills a vacancy created by Judge William Hanrahans resignation. As the last week has shown, we need top-to-bottom change in our criminal justice system to address its systemic racism, said <person>Gov. Evers</person>. One of the ways we can do this is ensuring we have judges who understand and reflect the communities they serve. As a former teacher and highly accomplished public defender, <person>Mario White</person> will do just that.</p>\n<p>White is currently a <org>Dane County Court</org> Commissioner, where he handles family, criminal, and other proceedings. Between 2008 and 2018, White was an assistant state public defender, representing individuals accused of crimes in Dane County. White also is an adjunct professor at the <org>University of Wisconsin Law School</org>, where he teaches courses on trial advocacy and coaches mock trial.</p>\n<p><person>Mario White</person> is a superb addition to the Dane County judiciary. White understands the role of a judge and understands the need for all who come before the court to be heard. He brings a wealth of knowledge, experience, and integrity to the bench. We are confident that he will ensure justice for all, said Judges <person>Rhonda L. Lanford</person> and <person>Ellen K. Berz</person>.</p>\n<p>I am humbled and honored to be appointed to the Dane County bench by <person>Governor Evers</person>. The need for a compassionate, impartial, and independent judiciary has never been greater. I look forward to bringing my perspective and experiences to the bench to ensure equal justice for all, said White. White graduated from the <org>University of Wisconsin Law School</org> in 2008. He earned his undergraduate degree from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0529578630\">Oklahoma State University</org>. Prior to law school, White was a high school math teacher for three years in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.dallas\">Dallas, Texas</location>.</p>",
