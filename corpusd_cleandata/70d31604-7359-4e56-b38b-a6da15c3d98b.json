    "text": "Jun. 5\\--Whenever he's toeing the rubber on the pitcher's mound, Larson\nKindreich has always shown a knack for being remarkably calm, cool and\ncollected.\n\nBumped off the mound these days by the coronavirus pandemic, the former Crater\nHigh star has been understandably stressed but still able to maintain a level\nof composure thanks to the support of his family and faith in God.\n\n\"I think a lot of people around me have really kept me grounded through this\ntime,\" said Kindreich. \"My parents and my brothers have done an amazing job of\nkeeping me focused on what's important, along with my faith in Jesus. Right\nnow I'm just taking it one day at a time and we'll see what God has planned\nfor me.\"\n\nWhat exactly could have the 6-foot-4, 210-pound left-handed pitcher so off-\nkilter?\n\nLess than a year ago, Kindreich first learned of a rule that allows him to be\neligible for the upcoming Major League Baseball draft on June 10-11 due to his\nturning 21 within 45 days of the draft date.\n\nKindreich, whose birthday is June 21, was initially stunned by the revelation\nthat he wouldn't have to wait until after his junior season at Biola\nUniversity to become draft-eligible.\n\nEverything then truly went into a tailspin when COVID-19 shortened his\nsophomore season this spring after only 14 games, followed by MLB and its\nplayers association reaching a deal in March that shortened this year's draft\nto five rounds and next year's draft potentially to 20 rounds -- well off the\nstandard 40 rounds.\n\nAnother twist this year is that, after the five rounds have concluded, teams\ncan issue an unlimited number of free agent contracts at a $20,000 maximum.\n\n\"I really have no idea what to think with all that's going on,\" said\nKindreich. \"The communication I've been getting from scouts has kind of been\nall over the place. With the draft being so dramatically shortened, it's kind\nof hard to say what will happen.\"\n\n\"I had a lot of teams earlier talking about me in the top-10 rounds,\" he\nadded, \"but now that it's just five rounds, a lot of teams are kind of\nconsolidating and trying to figure out who they want to take and who they can\ntake so it's all up in the air. It's really easy to get stressed about it but\nI know God has a plan and there's really not much I can do about it at this\npoint. Hopefully it happens, but I'll be fine either way.\"\n\nKindreich certainly gave MLB scouts plenty to ponder with his dominant showing\nthis spring.\n\nAfter feeling his way through his freshman season with a 3-2 record and 7.01\nERA with 72 strikeouts in 522\\/3 innings, Kindreich came into his sophomore\nyear a little more grounded and dialed in thanks to the efforts of Biola's\nfirst-year coaching staff, led by head coach Jeff Calhoon and pitching coach\nBen Cordy.\n\n\"The experience of being a second-year player was a big part of being able to\ntrust my stuff,\" said Kindreich. \"I think as a freshman, no matter how good\nyou are, you kind of have a little something in the back of your head saying,\n'All right, this is a new level, let's kind of see where I add up to these\nother guys.' This past year that was gone and I was ready to compete and just\ngo take care of business.\"\n\nKindreich did exactly that while he had the chance.\n\nHe started the season with 252\\/3 consecutive scoreless innings and didn't\nallow an earned run in all 30 of his innings pitched this year, setting NCAA-\nera program records at Biola with each result.\n\nThe lefty was named Pacific West Conference Pitcher of the Week three times\nover the first three weeks of the season and finished with a 3-1 record in\nfive starts, with 48 strikeouts against only five walks and 15 hits allowed.\nHe gave up two unearned runs on the season.\n\n\"I think for Larson, we knew whenever he went on the mound we had an\nopportunity,\" said Calhoon, who last season served as an assistant at Point\nLoma Nazarene University. \"If you have your No. 1 on the mound, you have a\nfeeling that you have a chance to win every game. He did a great job filling\ninto that role. Originally he wasn't in that role, but I think he believed he\nwas that type of pitcher and we made him prove it and he did a good job of\ndoing that. He earned everything he got this year.\"\n\nIn turn, the Eagles (12-2) earned their first national ranking as an NCAA\nDivision II program this year, climbing to No. 8 before the season was halted.\n\n\"When you have something so great like we had with our team and it can\ndisappear just like that under such strange circumstances, it's tough to\nhandle,\" said Kindreich. \"Everybody was playing well and we all got along\nwell, it just made it so much fun and so easy to go out and compete. It stung\nquite a bit to get that cut short because we'll never have that team back\nagain.\"\n\nThroughout his stellar start this season, Kindreich remained unfazed.\n\nThen again, he's had a proud history of putting together dominant streaks.\n\nDuring his senior season at Crater in 2018, Kindreich authored a streak of 37\nconsecutive innings without allowing a hit in what is believed to be the\nlongest such accomplishment in Oregon history.\n\nHe finished that season by not allowing a run in his final 432\\/3 innings\npitched, including seven scoreless innings with 14 strikeouts to clinch the\nClass 5A state championship with a 2-0 win over Crescent Valley in the Comets'\nsecond straight finals appearance.\n\n\"You just try not to focus on it,\" Kindreich said of this year's scoreless\nstreak. \"You can't completely ignore it but you kind of try to push it out of\nyour mind a little bit because you feel like, 'OK, if I think about it too\nmuch then it's going to end.' Not that it really matters but of course I'm\ngoing to try to hold onto it, that just means a better chance for our team to\nwin. If I can go out there and put up zeros, that's a good day for the team.\"\n\nKindreich credited preseason work with Cordy as a springboard for this year's\nsuccess. The duo worked a lot on developing a changeup to complement a sharp\nfastball and diving curveball. Kindreich has reached 92 miles per hour on his\nfastball, which averages around 88-90 mph, and refined his curveball to elicit\nstrikes whether the batter swings or not.\n\n\"I felt good with all three pitches going into the season,\" said Kindreich.\n\"The changeup really just opened up another possibility for me. You didn't\nfeel as cornered into that fastball-curveball combination so it makes the\nhitters guess that much more. I feel like I can throw whatever I want now in\nany count.\"\n\nCalhoon saw Kindreich from an opposing dugout last year and could see an\nimportant difference in his deliveries this year.\n\n\"I think he kind of understands the value in strikes more,\" said the coach,\n\"and understands the ability to attack hitters and keep guys off balance by\nthrowing multiple pitches for strikes as opposed to just being able to blow it\nby everybody. It was really great to see him grow and develop and really kind\nof take ownership of his development.\"\n\nCurrently sidelined by the ongoing quarantine, Kindreich has used the break to\nrest his arm and hit the weights hard in an effort to be stronger for next\nseason. He continues to have a willing catch partner in older brother Honus,\nwho also has been a key contributor at Biola, and the baseball-loving duo have\ndone all they can to continue their throwing regimen.\n\nHonus Kindreich went 2-0 in 14 relief appearances with a 5.32 ERA last year,\nand the 6-5, 230-pound redshirt junior joined his brother in being especially\nsharp this year with a 1-0 record and 1.93 ERA in five relief appearances.\n\n\"I can't say enough about him,\" said Larson Kindreich of the right-handed\nHonus. \"He's the best catch partner you could ask for.\"\n\nNeither Kindreich loses a year of eligibility from this season so they\ntheoretically could play together for two more years and, as Calhoon\nrightfully points out, it seems more likely that they will be together at\nleast one more year.\n\n\"Larson is going to get his looks and get an opportunity,\" Calhoon said of\nnext week's draft, \"but obviously the shortened amount of rounds is going to\nbe a disadvantage for him as well as for us. He had a good showcase for us, he\nhad a good scout day and obviously he got off to a great start but, for us,\nunfortunately not everybody gets to come see us at the first of the year. A\nlot of guys want to see how guys develop and they want to catch you closer to\nthe draft.\"\n\nCalhoon said he and his staff are looking forward to having Kindreich back\nnext year to give him a full season to show what he can do, but the thing\nabout any draft is you never know what will happen.\n\n\"I have a lot of leverage in terms of eligibility with college left so there's\nno pressure on me,\" said Kindreich. \"It doesn't feel at all like, 'Oh, this is\nmy only chance and if I don't go now I'm going to quit baseball and my life's\ngoing to be over.'\"\n\n\"It sucks that the draft has been shortened and the virus has changed\neverything about the way the draft looks,\" he added. \"I could get worked up\nabout it -- and I've been pretty stressed at times about it -- but more\nrecently it's been kind of like, 'OK, we'll see what happens. It's not up to\nme.' I did my best and now we'll see what the teams think.\"\n\nHave a local story idea?

    "title": "Kindreich gives MLB scouts plenty to ponder [Mail Tribune, Medford, Ore.]",
    "html": "<p><chron>Jun. 5</chron>--Whenever he's toeing the rubber on the pitcher's mound, <person>Larson Kindreich</person> has always shown a knack for being remarkably calm, cool and collected.</p>\n<p>Bumped off the mound these days by the coronavirus pandemic, the former Crater High star has been understandably stressed but still able to maintain a level of composure thanks to the support of his family and faith in God.</p>\n<p>\"I think a lot of people around me have really kept me grounded through this time,\" said Kindreich. \"My parents and my brothers have done an amazing job of keeping me focused on what's important, along with my faith in Jesus. Right now I'm just taking it one day at a time and we'll see what God has planned for me.\"</p>\n<p>What exactly could have the 6-foot-4, 210-pound left-handed pitcher so off-kilter?</p>\n<p>Less than a year ago, Kindreich first learned of a rule that allows him to be eligible for the upcoming Major <org>League Baseball</org> draft on <chron>June 10-11</chron> due to his turning 21 within 45 days of the draft date.</p>\n<p>Kindreich, whose birthday is <chron>June 21</chron>, was initially stunned by the revelation that he wouldn't have to wait until after his junior season at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0707434304\">Biola University</org> to become draft-eligible.</p>\n<p>Everything then truly went into a tailspin when COVID-19 shortened his sophomore season this spring after only 14 games, followed by MLB and its players association reaching a deal in March that shortened this year's draft to five rounds and next year's draft potentially to 20 rounds -- well off the standard 40 rounds.</p>\n<p>Another twist this year is that, after the five rounds have concluded, teams can issue an unlimited number of free agent contracts at a <money>$20,000</money> maximum.</p>\n<p>\"I really have no idea what to think with all that's going on,\" said Kindreich. \"The communication I've been getting from scouts has kind of been all over the place. With the draft being so dramatically shortened, it's kind of hard to say what will happen.\"</p>\n<p>\"I had a lot of teams earlier talking about me in the top-10 rounds,\" he added, \"but now that it's just five rounds, a lot of teams are kind of consolidating and trying to figure out who they want to take and who they can take so it's all up in the air. It's really easy to get stressed about it but I know God has a plan and there's really not much I can do about it at this point. Hopefully it happens, but I'll be fine either way.\"</p>\n<p>Kindreich certainly gave MLB scouts plenty to ponder with his dominant showing this spring.</p>\n<p>After feeling his way through his freshman season with a 3-2 record and 7.01 ERA with 72 strikeouts in 522\\/3 innings, Kindreich came into his sophomore year a little more grounded and dialed in thanks to the efforts of Biola's first-year coaching staff, led by head coach <person>Jeff Calhoon</person> and pitching coach <person>Ben Cordy</person>.</p>\n<p>\"The experience of being a second-year player was a big part of being able to trust my stuff,\" said Kindreich. \"I think as a freshman, no matter how good you are, you kind of have a little something in the back of your head saying, 'All right, this is a new level, let's kind of see where I add up to these other guys.' This past year that was gone and I was ready to compete and just go take care of business.\"</p>\n<p>Kindreich did exactly that while he had the chance.</p>\n<p>He started the season with 252\\/3 consecutive scoreless innings and didn't allow an earned run in all 30 of his innings pitched this year, setting <org>NCAA</org>-era program records at Biola with each result.</p>\n<p>The lefty was named Pacific West Conference Pitcher of the Week three times over the first three weeks of the season and finished with a 3-1 record in five starts, with 48 strikeouts against only five walks and 15 hits allowed. He gave up two unearned runs on the season.</p>\n<p>\"I think for Larson, we knew whenever he went on the mound we had an opportunity,\" said Calhoon, who last season served as an assistant at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1721101085\">Point Loma Nazarene University</org>. \"If you have your No. 1 on the mound, you have a feeling that you have a chance to win every game. He did a great job filling into that role. Originally he wasn't in that role, but I think he believed he was that type of pitcher and we made him prove it and he did a good job of doing that. He earned everything he got this year.\"</p>\n<p>In turn, the Eagles (12-2) earned their first national ranking as an <org>NCAA</org> Division II program this year, climbing to No. 8 before the season was halted.</p>\n<p>\"When you have something so great like we had with our team and it can disappear just like that under such strange circumstances, it's tough to handle,\" said Kindreich. \"Everybody was playing well and we all got along well, it just made it so much fun and so easy to go out and compete. It stung quite a bit to get that cut short because we'll never have that team back again.\"</p>\n<p>Throughout his stellar start this season, Kindreich remained unfazed.</p>\n<p>Then again, he's had a proud history of putting together dominant streaks.</p>\n<p>During his senior season at Crater in 2018, Kindreich authored a streak of 37 consecutive innings without allowing a hit in what is believed to be the longest such accomplishment in Oregon history.</p>\n<p>He finished that season by not allowing a run in his final 432\\/3 innings pitched, including seven scoreless innings with 14 strikeouts to clinch the Class 5A state championship with a 2-0 win over Crescent Valley in the Comets' second straight finals appearance.</p>\n<p>\"You just try not to focus on it,\" Kindreich said of this year's scoreless streak. \"You can't completely ignore it but you kind of try to push it out of your mind a little bit because you feel like, 'OK, if I think about it too much then it's going to end.' Not that it really matters but of course I'm going to try to hold onto it, that just means a better chance for our team to win. If I can go out there and put up zeros, that's a good day for the team.\"</p>\n<p>Kindreich credited preseason work with Cordy as a springboard for this year's success. The duo worked a lot on developing a changeup to complement a sharp fastball and diving curveball. Kindreich has reached 92 miles per hour on his fastball, which averages around 88-90 mph, and refined his curveball to elicit strikes whether the batter swings or not.</p>\n<p>\"I felt good with all three pitches going into the season,\" said Kindreich. \"The changeup really just opened up another possibility for me. You didn't feel as cornered into that fastball-curveball combination so it makes the hitters guess that much more. I feel like I can throw whatever I want now in any count.\"</p>\n<p>Calhoon saw Kindreich from an opposing dugout last year and could see an important difference in his deliveries this year.</p>\n<p>\"I think he kind of understands the value in strikes more,\" said the coach, \"and understands the ability to attack hitters and keep guys off balance by throwing multiple pitches for strikes as opposed to just being able to blow it by everybody. It was really great to see him grow and develop and really kind of take ownership of his development.\"</p>\n<p>Currently sidelined by the ongoing quarantine, Kindreich has used the break to rest his arm and hit the weights hard in an effort to be stronger for next season. He continues to have a willing catch partner in older brother Honus, who also has been a key contributor at Biola, and the baseball-loving duo have done all they can to continue their throwing regimen.</p>\n<p><person>Honus Kindreich</person> went 2-0 in 14 relief appearances with a 5.32 ERA last year, and the 6-5, 230-pound redshirt junior joined his brother in being especially sharp this year with a 1-0 record and 1.93 ERA in five relief appearances.</p>\n<p>\"I can't say enough about him,\" said <person>Larson Kindreich</person> of the right-handed Honus. \"He's the best catch partner you could ask for.\"</p>\n<p>Neither Kindreich loses a year of eligibility from this season so they theoretically could play together for two more years and, as Calhoon rightfully points out, it seems more likely that they will be together at least one more year.</p>\n<p>\"Larson is going to get his looks and get an opportunity,\" Calhoon said of next week's draft, \"but obviously the shortened amount of rounds is going to be a disadvantage for him as well as for us. He had a good showcase for us, he had a good scout day and obviously he got off to a great start but, for us, unfortunately not everybody gets to come see us at the first of the year. A lot of guys want to see how guys develop and they want to catch you closer to the draft.\"</p>\n<p>Calhoon said he and his staff are looking forward to having Kindreich back next year to give him a full season to show what he can do, but the thing about any draft is you never know what will happen.</p>\n<p>\"I have a lot of leverage in terms of eligibility with college left so there's no pressure on me,\" said Kindreich. \"It doesn't feel at all like, 'Oh, this is my only chance and if I don't go now I'm going to quit baseball and my life's going to be over.'\"</p>\n<p>\"It sucks that the draft has been shortened and the virus has changed everything about the way the draft looks,\" he added. \"I could get worked up about it -- and I've been pretty stressed at times about it -- but more recently it's been kind of like, 'OK, we'll see what happens. It's not up to me.' I did my best and now we'll see what the teams think.\"</p>\n<p>Have a local story idea?
