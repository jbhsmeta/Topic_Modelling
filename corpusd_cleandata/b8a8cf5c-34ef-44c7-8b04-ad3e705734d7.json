    "text": "The Brandon Road Rebels took their Rollin' COVID Appreciation Tour outside the\ncity last Sunday, hoping to lift the spirits of rural seniors and front-line\nworkers who are being particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to Road Rebels president Dave Burba, this outing was a smashing\nsuccess, since more than 150 motorists from all over Westman, including some\nparticipants from Saskatchewan, ended up joining their great big convoy that\ntravelled through Minnedosa, Neepawa and Carberry.\n\n\"It was just awesome to see,\" Burba said on Tuesday. \"Everybody seemed to\nreally appreciate it; the hospitals, the personal care homes, their service\npeople, everybody just seemed to just think it was a wonderful idea, and we're\nso glad and happy that we could be a part of it.\"\n\nBurba described this as the largest rural cruise he's seen in western\nManitoba, with only last year's Super Run tour of the Second Chance Car Museum\nin Treherne being comparable in terms of scale.\n\nSunday's event officially kicked off at 1 p.m., with approximately 100\nmotorists taking off from the Beaver Truck Centre parking lot in Brandon.\n\nFrom there, the convoy joined up with even more classic car enthusiasts in\nMinnedosa and Neepawa, creating a cacophony of old-school engine growls that\ndrew waves and cheers from nearby spectators.\n\n\"It was just a real uplifting event for the town at this time of year with\nthis COVID-19 that's going on,\" Minnedosa Valley Cruisers president Don\nMorrison said. \"It brightened everybody up for a while.\"\n\nThe cruisers also made sure to patronize several local businesses along the\nway, pulling up for a tasty treat at Minnedosa's Dari Isle Drive-In and some\nsoft serve at the Dairy Queen in Neepawa.\n\nLocal resident Terry Smith, who was following along in his 1986 Pontiac\nParisienne Brougham, told the Sun the convoy's ice cream pit stop in Neepawa\nwas a pretty spectacular site, with roughly 123 vehicles snaking around the\nrestaurant's drive-thru window.\n\nSmith said the Carberry leg of the journey was the absolute highlight of his\nday since, in his estimation, close to 60 per cent of the town's population\ncame out to watch them drive by.\n\n\"This is like a dream that I had, and it finally came true,\" Smith said.\n\"Every car was so nice and shiny and nobody was hot rodding or spinning tires\nor being foolish. And the look on the people's faces when all these cars went\nby was happiness in a lot of ways.\"\n\nSunday's event was just the latest evolution in the Road Rebels' rollin'\ntours, which have replaced their static downtown cruise nights that usually\ntake place this time of year.\n\nNow, instead of parking their cars in downtown Brandon for an extended period\nof time, local motorists are encouraged to drive around a set route and stay\nin their vehicles as much as possible to try to maintain social distancing.\n\nThe first official rollin' tour took place in Brandon on May 3, and ever since\nthen, Smith said, he and other other Westman gear heads have embraced the new\nformat, actually preferring it to what's come before.\n\n\"I would sooner go for a cruise than I would sit on the street and have people\nlook at my car,\" he said. \"And I've talked to four different people from\nNeepawa who were involved on Sunday, and they all said that a cruise was more\nfun than going to a car show, really.\"\n\nBrandon car enthusiast Lindsay Rystephanuk expects these rollin' tours will be\nthe standard event format for Westman car enthusiasts throughout the rest of\nthe summer, which is just fine by him.\n\n\"This COVID thing has really changed the status quo of how we show off our\ncars,\" he said. \"It's all different, and I think we're finding a very\nsuccessful formula for getting our cars out there and getting the people to\nsee them.\"\n\nThe Road Rebels' next rollin' tour is scheduled to take place in Brandon on\nFather's Day, June 21. Visit the club's official Facebook page for more\ninformation on any upcoming events.\n\n\u00bb [kdarbyson@brandonsun.com](mailto:kdarbyson@brandonsun.com)\n\n\u00bb Twitter: @KyleDarbyson",

And the look on the people&#8217;s faces when all these cars went by was happiness in a lot of ways.&#8221;</p><p>Sunday&#8217;s event was just the latest evolution in the Road Rebels&#8217; rollin&#8217; tours, which have replaced their static downtown cruise nights that usually take place this time of year.</p><p>Now, instead of parking their cars in downtown <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.mb.bradon\">Brandon</location> for an extended period of time, local motorists are encouraged to drive around a set route and stay in their vehicles as much as possible to try to maintain social distancing.</p><p>The first official rollin&#8217; tour took place in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.mb.bradon\">Brandon</location> on <chron>May 3</chron>, and ever since then, Smith said, he and other other Westman gear heads have embraced the new format, actually preferring it to what&#8217;s come before.</p><p>&#8220;I would sooner go for a cruise than I would sit on the street and have people look at my car,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve talked to four different people from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.mb.neeawa\">Neepawa</location> who were involved on Sunday, and they all said that a cruise was more fun than going to a car show, really.&#8221;</p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.mb.bradon\">Brandon</location> car enthusiast <person>Lindsay Rystephanuk</person> expects these rollin&#8217; tours will be the standard event format for Westman car enthusiasts throughout the rest of the summer, which is just fine by him.</p><p>&#8220;This COVID thing has really changed the status quo of how we show off our cars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all different, and I think we&#8217;re finding a very successful formula for getting our cars out there and getting the people to see them.&#8221;</p><p>The Road Rebels&#8217; next rollin&#8217; tour is scheduled to take place in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.mb.bradon\">Brandon</location> on Father&#8217;s Day, <chron>June 21</chron>.
