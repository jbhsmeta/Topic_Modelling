    "text": "Weightless: 10 Interstellar Pieces for Piano\n\nby Jason, Sifford\n\nWillis Music Company, 2020.\n\n[www.willispianomusic.com](http://www.willispianomusic.com), 31 pp., $8.99.\nLater-Elementary/Early-Intermediate level.\n\nUpon seeing this collection's title, \"Weightless,\" the typical New Year's\nresolution of dieting popped into my head. It didn't take long, though, to\ndiscover that the music in this book had a more scientific theme: space\ntravel. The 10 pieces are full of delightful ideas about how it might feel and\nsound to be in particular outer space locations. I found it impressive that,\nin the preface, composer Jason Sifford offers scientific facts and references,\nalong with technique tips, for each piece.\n\nPlaying through the book, I could see where the music Sifford wrote brought\nthe science to life right in my studio! For instance, \"Toccata-Rocket\" takes\noff dramatically with the steady sizzle of a Cape Canaveral launch, bringing\nwith it stomach-tightening nerves until its capsule safely breaks away to\nsmoothly zip further into space, then return and finish with a loud descent\ninto an earthly ocean.\n\nI asked four of my late-elementary/early-intermediate piano students to sight-\nread any piece they chose from this collection. A middle school-aged boy chose\n\"Dodging Asteroids,\" a piece with obstacles of speed and alternating staccato\nand legato phrases. A high school girl thought the entire book looked\ninteresting, and really enjoyed its title piece \"Weightless\" because its\nfloaty sound, almost entirely in treble clef, was pretty. A high school boy\nappreciated that \"Wild's Journey\" seemed less complicated than the pop books\n(piano/vocal/guitar) he usually selects. An adult student noticed the 6/8 and\n9/8 time signatures of \"Enceladus\" right away and hoped to see, hear and feel\nthe explosion of Saturn's moon parts moving into the planet's well-known\nrings.\n\nAfter the sight-reading session, these compositions are now being practiced\ninto performance pieces for the next recital.--Reviewed by Mary Kaye Owen,\nRenton, Washington",

The 10 pieces are full\nof delightful ideas about how it might feel and sound to be in\nparticular outer space locations. I found it impressive that, in the\npreface, composer <person>Jason Sifford</person> offers scientific facts and references,\nalong with technique tips, for each piece.</p>\n\n<p>Playing through the book, I could see where the music Sifford wrote\nbrought the science to life right in my studio! For instance,\n\"Toccata-Rocket\" takes off dramatically with the steady sizzle\nof a <location>Cape Canaveral</location> launch, bringing with it stomach-tightening nerves\nuntil its capsule safely breaks away to smoothly zip further into space,\nthen return and finish with a loud descent into an earthly ocean.</p>\n\n<p>I asked four of my late-elementary/early-intermediate piano\nstudents to sight-read any piece they chose from this collection. A\nmiddle school-aged boy chose \"Dodging Asteroids,\" a piece with\nobstacles of speed and alternating staccato and legato phrases. A high\nschool girl thought the entire book looked interesting, and really\nenjoyed its title piece \"Weightless\" because its floaty sound,\nalmost entirely in treble clef, was pretty. A high school boy\nappreciated that \"Wild's Journey\" seemed less complicated\nthan the pop books (piano/vocal/guitar) he usually selects. An adult\nstudent noticed the 6/8 and 9/8 time signatures of \"Enceladus\"\nright away and hoped to see, hear and feel the explosion of\nSaturn's moon parts moving into the planet's well-known rings.</p>\n\n<p>After the sight-reading session, these compositions are now being\npracticed into performance pieces for the next recital.--Reviewed by\n<person>Mary Kaye Owen</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wa.renton\">Renton, Washington</location></p>",
