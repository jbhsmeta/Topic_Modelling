    "text": "Pandemic rekindles love of riding\n\nIn this odd, pandemic-stricken time when haying habits are as difficult to\npredict as the weather, bicycles have become the new toilet paper.\n\nPedal hikes have become so scarce, theyve turned specialty cycling shops- once\nthe bastion of spandex-clad riding fanatics-into an oasis for people thirsting\nfor something that will roll away the lockdown monotony and give them a little\nexercise.\n\nBicycle shops-due to the role they play in transportation-in March were deemed\nessential businesses. Most have stayed open through the pandemic.\n\nOn a recent weekday, Nancy Parent, longtime owner of Matthews Bicycle Mart on\nthe citys northeast side, looked out her shops window in amazement.\n\n\"It's an absolute traffic jam in my parking lot, and it's a Tuesday, she said.\nIt's been like this since early March.\n\nParent said sales at Matthews are up about 70% in the last three months. Her\nshop at 7272 Pendleton Pike-one of the biggest in the state-usually stocks\nmore than 500 new bicycles.\n\nRight now, we have about 150, she said. It's been overwhelming.\n\nSome local bicycle shop owners have reported sales two to three times higher\nthan normal for this time of year.\n\nWe've sold a summer's worth of bikes in April and May, said Charlie Revard,\nco-owner of The Bike Line in Broad Ripple.\n\nTo keep the store clean and his staff and customers safe, The Bike Line has\nmoved to a curbside service model, where customers tell employees what they're\nlooking for and product is brought out to them.\n\n\"We've had times where we have brought a bicycle out for someone to look at\nand they decided not to buy it, but the person a spot or two behind them in\nline will speak up and say, 'I'll take it,'\" Revard said. \"That's the kind of\ndemand we're seeing. We've been in business for 41 years, and this is the\nbusiest we've ever been.\"\n\nMany types and brands of bicycles are selling out of specialty shops and mass\nretailers alike, and restocking has become a serious problem.\n\nBrian Gootee, owner of Gray Goat Bicycle Co., which has four central Indiana\nstores, said, if he had all the inventory he wanted, sales would be up at\nleast fivefold from normal.\n\n\"If I had all the $500 mountain bikes I wanted, I could sell one after another\nafter another,\" he said.\n\nGray Goat has tried to limit the number of people in the store, but that, too,\nhas been challenging.\n\n\"We have all these signs up about store limits and social distancing, and\nthere are still people who just blow by them and don't pay any attention,\"\nGootee said. \"We have had some days where there have been long lines waiting\nto get in. Believe me, we're working as fast as we can.\"\n\nNationally, bicycle sales are up 141% in March and April compared to the\nprevious year, according to NPD Group, a New York-based market research firm.\nSales in big cities such as Boston, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia have\nbeen pumped up by people looking to avoid mass transit, NPD said.\n\nBut elsewhere, demand has been fueled by the closure of gyms due to the\npandemic, along with the continued growth of rails-to-trails programs and\nconstruction of dedicated bicycle trails locally and nationally. In addition,\nbikes have allowed families stuck inside to get outside in a socially distant\nway.\n\nSpecialty bicycle shops usually see customers coming from a 15-mile radius.\nBut people are so desperate to find bicycles and accessories that many stores'\ncustomer bases have grown dramatically.\n\nIn the last 10 weeks, Gray Goat has served customers who drove in from Ohio,\nKentucky, Illinois and Michigan. \"I've shipped a bike as far as California,\"\nGootee said.\n\nThe demand has become so great that managing a local shop's website has become\na full-time job, shop owners said. The phones, too, are ringing off the hook.\nAnd most specialty shops have fewer than 10 employees.\n\n\"These are major challenges for small businesses like ours,\" said Revard,\nwhose shop has five full-time and five part-time employees. \"From May 20 to\n26, we had more than 800 inbound phone calls. That's more than double the\naverage.\"\n\nGoing, going, gone!\n\nParent's crew at Matthews barely has time to get bikes into the store.\n\n\"We pull a bike out of a box, and we're literally selling them before we get\nit put together,\" Parent said.\n\nGray Goat has a waiting list for bicycles. Gootee said he has about 20% the\nnumber of bicycles on the floor he normally does.\n\n\"There's been an insane demand for anything under $800, and now we've started\nto see demand grow on the higher price points,\" Gootee said.\n\nHe is telling visitors to his bike shop, \"If you're sitting there with your\nhand on a bike that you want, you better buy it. Because it won't be here in\n15 minutes.\"\n\nWhile that might sound like sales hype, Indianapolis resident Tom Smock said\nit's not.\n\nSmock was at Matthews recently because he had a bicycle sold out from under\nhim at another store.\n\n\"I was shopping for a bike for my 11-year-old daughter. I found one that was\nsomething like $600,\" Smock told IBJ. \"I went to call my wife to see what she\nthought, came back 10 minutes later, and it was gone.\"\n\nSmock said he had already scoured Target and Meijer. \"Bike inventory is down\nto almost nothing at the big-box retailers,\" he said.\n\nHe later found his daughter a bike at Matthews. \"They were just putting it on\nthe floor, and this time around, we grabbed it,\" he said.\n\nSmock said he dusted off his 25-yearold bike during spring cleaning and\ndecided to get it fixed up so he could ride with his two children. \"I don't\nthink I had ridden a bike in 20 years, since high school,\" he said.\n\nHe's found riding a bicycle \"is a great way to explore.\"\n\n\"When my kids rode before-which wasn't very often-they stayed on our\ndriveway,\" Smock said. \"Now, me and my son and daughter ride all over the\nneighborhood, and sometimes farther than that. It's been a great way to get\naway from the electronics, get some fresh air and check out places we never\nknew existed. It's amazing the things I never knew were here.\"\n\nJuggling demands\n\nSmock was lucky. He got his bicycle in to get worked on before service wait\ntimes grew dramatically.\n\nWhile The Bike Line in Broad Ripple is still turning bicycle repairs around in\nabout five days, many local bicycle shop service departments are backed up\nseveral weeks. Gootee said wait times at his shops are running four weeks.\nNormally, all repairs at Gray Goat can be turned around in two to three days.\nThe story is the same at Matthews.\n\n\"People are at home and they're cleaning out their garage, their shed or their\nchicken coop and they're running across their old bikes and start thinking,\n'Hey, let's get this out and get outside and get some exercise,\" Gootee said.\n\n\"There are days we are checking in so many bikes that need repairs, we can't\neven find the time to do a single repair,\" he said.\n\nStill, he and his staff are trying to get some quick fixes done while people\nwait.\n\n\"We've had so many people with flat tires that some days we do nothing but fix\nflats,\" he said. \"I've had days where I'm fixing four flats myself at one\ntime. I'm coming home at midnight a lot of nights. We can't find a solution.\"\n\nGootee has even contemplated closing one day a week just so all his workers\ncan dedicate their time to the backlog of repairs.\n\nBicycles aren't the only items selling. Local bike shops owners said\naccessories such as helmets, water bottles, tires and innertubes, bike chains,\ncar-mounted bicycle racks and kickstands are selling faster than they can\nreorder them.\n\nThe biggest seller, though, is baby seats.\n\n\"Not a single distributor in the nation has one,\" Gootee said. \"Trailers, too,\nare selling out fast.\"\n\nThe rush has left many shop owners rushing to make deals with new\ndistributors. Gootee has brought in two new brands. The Bike Line is also\nbringing in new brands-with an emphasis on family-style bikes under $1,000.\n\nSupply chain crash\n\nThough bicycle shops have remained open, some area residents are just starting\nto venture out, which is creating another wave of sales, shop owners said.\n\nBut local shops and the pedal bike industry as a whole have another major-\npotentially crippling-problem.\n\nWith many bicycles, parts and accessories made overseas and in China, supply\nhas become a serious problem because of about three months of quarantine in\nmuch of Asia.\n\n\"March, April and May was a feast, but June, July and August could be a famine\nfor the industry,\" said Brad Hughes, founding partner and managing director\nfor Human Powered Solutions, a Wisconsin-based cycling industry research\norganization. \"The broken supply line and lack of inventory could become\ncrippling in the coming months.\"\n\nWith overseas manufacturing plants just starting to reopen, many bicycle shops\nwon't be able to get major shipments of new inventory until September or\nOctober.\n\n\"I'm scared about June, July and August,\" Gootee said. \"I'm not looking at\nthis like a big windfall and having a party. I'm a squirrel, and I'm putting\nmy nuts away.\"\n\nHe is crossing his fingers that he'll get a shipment of bicycles in the \"next\ncouple of weeks.\"\n\n\"We're taking whatever we can find wherever we can find it,\" he said.\n\nThe extended shutdown came at the worst possible time for bicycle shops.\nChinese manufacturing plants close for two to three weeks each Chinese New\nYear, which begins in late January. This year, they weren't able to reopen as\nnormal in early to mid-February-often one of the busiest times for bicycle\nmanufacturers-because the pandemic had set in.\n\nAnd while Chinese plants are finally reopening, major plants in Malaysia,\nSingapore and the Philippines haven't yet, Hughes said.\n\nEven American bicycle manufacturers like Cannondale, Trek and Specialized-\nwhich make few or no bicycles in China-are challenged.\n\n\"Bicycle makers can't just ramp up manufacturing, because there's a shortage\nfor almost all the parts they need to build bikes,\" Hughes said. \"Right now,\nwe're looking at a 90- to 120-day lag in product from China and possibly\nlonger lag times from other key suppliers.\"\n\nHigh-stakes gamble\n\nGootee, who serves on an advisory board for Specialized, marvels at the sales\nexplosion.\n\n\"For years, we've been trying to find a way to give people a reason to put\ndown electronic devices and get on bikes,\" Gootee said. \"Who knew that reason\nwould be a worldwide pandemic? For the first time in 20 years, I'm seeing\nlarge numbers of kids riding around on bikes.\n\n\"Of course, no one predicted this,\" he said. \"But we have to find a way to\ncapitalize on it long term.\"\n\nGootee has reason to hope this boom will last well past this spring.\n\n\"I don't think this is just going to be a short-term phenomenon,\" he said.\n\"This pandemic has reversed trends 180 degrees. It's really changed people's\nmindsets. I'm hearing stories all day long about how fun it is to get on a\nbike and explore your neighborhood, your city and your state.\"\n\nMaking that kind of bet is a real gamble for bicycle shop owners, Hughes said.\n\nHuman Powered Solutions is currently conducting a study on future bicycle\nbuying habits that is set to be published in early July.\n\n\"Bike shops have a serious challenge predicting future sales,\" Hughes said.\n\"You certainly want to take advantage of this trend and meet your customers'\ndemands. But if these bike shops seeing this trend load up with inventory and\ncan't move it, it could be real trouble. Most of these shops are small\nbusinesses, and they could get upside down with debt pretty quickly.\n\n\"So this period now is great,\" he added. \"But it's not all about just letting\nthe good times roll.\"",

Most have stayed open through the pandemic.</p>\n<p>On a recent weekday, <person>Nancy Parent</person>, longtime owner of <org>Matthews Bicycle Mart</org> on the citys northeast side, looked out her shops window in amazement.</p>\n<p>\"It's an absolute traffic jam in my parking lot, and it's a Tuesday, she said. It's been like this since early March.</p>\n<p>Parent said sales at Matthews are up about 70% in the last three months. Her shop at <location>7272 Pendleton Pike</location>-one of the biggest in the state-usually stocks more than 500 new bicycles.</p>\n<p>Right now, we have about 150, she said. It's been overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Some local bicycle shop owners have reported sales two to three times higher than normal for this time of year.</p>\n<p>We've sold a summer's worth of bikes in April and May, said <person>Charlie Revard</person>, co-owner of The Bike Line in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.brdriv\">Broad Ripple</location>.</p>\n<p>To keep the store clean and his staff and customers safe, The Bike Line has moved to a curbside service model, where customers tell employees what they're looking for and product is brought out to them.</p>\n<p>\"We've had times where we have brought a bicycle out for someone to look at and they decided not to buy it, but the person a spot or two behind them in line will speak up and say, 'I'll take it,'\" Revard said. \"That's the kind of demand we're seeing. We've been in business for 41 years, and this is the busiest we've ever been.\"</p>\n<p>Many types and brands of bicycles are selling out of specialty shops and mass retailers alike, and restocking has become a serious problem.</p>\n<p><person>Brian Gootee</person>, owner of <org>Gray Goat Bicycle Co.</org>, which has four central <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.in\">Indiana</location> stores, said, if he had all the inventory he wanted, sales would be up at least fivefold from normal.</p>\n<p>\"If I had all the <money>$500</money> mountain bikes I wanted, I could sell one after another after another,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Gray Goat has tried to limit the number of people in the store, but that, too, has been challenging.</p>\n<p>\"We have all these signs up about store limits and social distancing, and there are still people who just blow by them and don't pay any attention,\" Gootee said. \"We have had some days where there have been long lines waiting to get in. Believe me, we're working as fast as we can.\"</p>\n<p>Nationally, bicycle sales are up 141% in March and April compared to the previous year, according to <org>NPD Group</org>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>-based market research firm. Sales in big cities such as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\">Boston</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> have been pumped up by people looking to avoid mass transit, NPD said.</p>\n<p>But elsewhere, demand has been fueled by the closure of gyms due to the pandemic, along with the continued growth of rails-to-trails programs and construction of dedicated bicycle trails locally and nationally. In addition, bikes have allowed families stuck inside to get outside in a socially distant way.</p>\n<p>Specialty bicycle shops usually see customers coming from a 15-mile radius. But people are so desperate to find bicycles and accessories that many stores' customer bases have grown dramatically.</p>\n<p>In the last 10 weeks, Gray Goat has served customers who drove in from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Kentucky</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.il\">Illinois</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location>. \"I've shipped a bike as far as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>,\" Gootee said.</p>\n<p>The demand has become so great that managing a local shop's website has become a full-time job, shop owners said. The phones, too, are ringing off the hook. And most specialty shops have fewer than 10 employees.</p>\n<p>\"These are major challenges for small businesses like ours,\" said Revard, whose shop has five full-time and five part-time employees. \"From <chron>May 20 to 26</chron>, we had more than 800 inbound phone calls. That's more than double the average.\"</p>\n<p>Going, going, gone!</p>\n<p>Parent's crew at Matthews barely has time to get bikes into the store.</p>\n<p>\"We pull a bike out of a box, and we're literally selling them before we get it put together,\" Parent said.</p>\n<p>Gray Goat has a waiting list for bicycles. Gootee said he has about 20% the number of bicycles on the floor he normally does.</p>\n<p>\"There's been an insane demand for anything under <money>$800</money>, and now we've started to see demand grow on the higher price points,\" Gootee said.</p>\n<p>He is telling visitors to his bike shop, \"If you're sitting there with your hand on a bike that you want, you better buy it. Because it won't be here in 15 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>While that might sound like sales hype, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.indpol\">Indianapolis</location> resident <person>Tom Smock</person> said it's not.</p>\n<p>Smock was at Matthews recently because he had a bicycle sold out from under him at another store.</p>\n<p>\"I was shopping for a bike for my 11-year-old daughter. I found one that was something like <money>$600</money>,\" Smock told IBJ. \"I went to call my wife to see what she thought, came back 10 minutes later, and it was gone.\"</p>\n<p>Smock said he had already scoured Target and Meijer. \"Bike inventory is down to almost nothing at the big-box retailers,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He later found his daughter a bike at Matthews. \"They were just putting it on the floor, and this time around, we grabbed it,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Smock said he dusted off his 25-yearold bike during spring cleaning and decided to get it fixed up so he could ride with his two children. \"I don't think I had ridden a bike in 20 years, since high school,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He's found riding a bicycle \"is a great way to explore.\"</p>\n<p>\"When my kids rode before-which wasn't very often-they stayed on our driveway,\" Smock said. \"Now, me and my son and daughter ride all over the neighborhood, and sometimes farther than that. It's been a great way to get away from the electronics, get some fresh air and check out places we never knew existed. It's amazing the things I never knew were here.\"</p>\n<p>Juggling demands</p>\n<p>Smock was lucky. He got his bicycle in to get worked on before service wait times grew dramatically.</p>\n<p>While The Bike Line in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.brdriv\">Broad Ripple</location> is still turning bicycle repairs around in about five days, many local bicycle shop service departments are backed up several weeks. Gootee said wait times at his shops are running four weeks. Normally, all repairs at Gray Goat can be turned around in two to three days. The story is the same at Matthews.</p>\n<p>\"People are at home and they're cleaning out their garage, their shed or their chicken coop and they're running across their old bikes and start thinking, 'Hey, let's get this out and get outside and get some exercise,\" Gootee said.</p>\n<p>\"There are days we are checking in so many bikes that need repairs, we can't even find the time to do a single repair,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Still, he and his staff are trying to get some quick fixes done while people wait.</p>\n<p>\"We've had so many people with flat tires that some days we do nothing but fix flats,\" he said. \"I've had days where I'm fixing four flats myself at one time. I'm coming home at midnight a lot of nights. We can't find a solution.\"</p>\n<p>Gootee has even contemplated closing one day a week just so all his workers can dedicate their time to the backlog of repairs.</p>\n<p>Bicycles aren't the only items selling. Local bike shops owners said accessories such as helmets, water bottles, tires and innertubes, bike chains, car-mounted bicycle racks and kickstands are selling faster than they can reorder them.</p>\n<p>The biggest seller, though, is baby seats.</p>\n<p>\"Not a single distributor in the nation has one,\" Gootee said. \"Trailers, too, are selling out fast.\"</p>\n<p>The rush has left many shop owners rushing to make deals with new distributors. Gootee has brought in two new brands. The Bike Line is also bringing in new brands-with an emphasis on family-style bikes under <money>$1,000</money>.</p>\n<p>Supply chain crash</p>\n<p>Though bicycle shops have remained open, some area residents are just starting to venture out, which is creating another wave of sales, shop owners said.</p>\n<p>But local shops and the pedal bike industry as a whole have another major- potentially crippling-problem.</p>\n<p>With many bicycles, parts and accessories made overseas and in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, supply has become a serious problem because of about three months of quarantine in much of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</location>.</p>\n<p>\"March, April and May was a feast, but June, July and August could be a famine for the industry,\" said <person>Brad Hughes</person>, founding partner and managing director for Human Powered Solutions, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location>-based cycling industry research organization. \"The broken supply line and lack of inventory could become crippling in the coming months.\"</p>\n<p>With overseas manufacturing plants just starting to reopen, many bicycle shops won't be able to get major shipments of new inventory until September or October.</p>\n<p>\"I'm scared about June, July and August,\" Gootee said. \"I'm not looking at this like a big windfall and having a party. I'm a squirrel, and I'm putting my nuts away.\"</p>\n<p>He is crossing his fingers that he'll get a shipment of bicycles in the \"next couple of weeks.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're taking whatever we can find wherever we can find it,\" he said.</p>\n<p>The extended shutdown came at the worst possible time for bicycle shops. Chinese manufacturing plants close for two to three weeks each <chron>Chinese New Year</chron>, which begins in late January. This year, they weren't able to reopen as normal in early to mid-February-often one of the busiest times for bicycle manufacturers-because the pandemic had set in.</p>\n<p>And while Chinese plants are finally reopening, major plants in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/my\">Malaysia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ph\">the Philippines</location> haven't yet, Hughes said.</p>\n<p>Even American bicycle manufacturers like <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3525104697\">Cannondale</org>, Trek and Specialized-which make few or no bicycles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>-are challenged.</p>\n<p>\"Bicycle makers can't just ramp up manufacturing, because there's a shortage for almost all the parts they need to build bikes,\" Hughes said. \"Right now, we're looking at a 90- to 120-day lag in product from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> and possibly longer lag times from other key suppliers.\"</p>\n<p>High-stakes gamble</p>\n<p>Gootee, who serves on an advisory board for Specialized, marvels at the sales explosion.</p>\n<p>\"For years, we've been trying to find a way to give people a reason to put down electronic devices and get on bikes,\" Gootee said. \"Who knew that reason would be a worldwide pandemic? For the first time in 20 years, I'm seeing large numbers of kids riding around on bikes.</p>\n<p>\"Of course, no one predicted this,\" he said. \"But we have to find a way to capitalize on it long term.\"</p>\n<p>Gootee has reason to hope this boom will last well past this spring.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think this is just going to be a short-term phenomenon,\" he said. \"This pandemic has reversed trends 180 degrees. It's really changed people's mindsets. I'm hearing stories all day long about how fun it is to get on a bike and explore your neighborhood, your city and your state.\"</p>\n<p>Making that kind of bet is a real gamble for bicycle shop owners, Hughes said.</p>\n<p>Human Powered Solutions is currently conducting a study on future bicycle buying habits that is set to be published in early July.</p>\n<p>\"Bike shops have a serious challenge predicting future sales,\" Hughes said. \"You certainly want to take advantage of this trend and meet your customers' demands. But if these bike shops seeing this trend load up with inventory and can't move it, it could be real trouble. Most of these shops are small businesses, and they could get upside down with debt pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>\"So this period now is great,\" he added. \"But it's not all about just letting the good times roll.\"</p>",
