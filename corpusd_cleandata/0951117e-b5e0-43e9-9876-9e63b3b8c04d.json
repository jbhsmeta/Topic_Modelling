    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily Asia\nBusiness -- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent\napplication by the inventor MACHIDA, Daisuke (Kanagawa, Japan), filed on\nOctober 17, 2019, was made available online on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee is Ricoh Company Ltd.\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"The present invention relates to an information\nprocessing system, an information processing method, and a recording medium.\n\n\"The use of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) has increased due to the changes in\nwork styles and the spread of mobile terminal apparatuses in recent years.\nBYOD is a form of connecting a mobile terminal apparatus owned by a user to an\nin-house network and the like, for use in business operations. A mobile\nterminal apparatus is a portable terminal device such as a smartphone, a\nmobile phone, a notebook computer and the like. As the use of BYOD increases,\nit is also necessary for an image forming apparatus to operate in cooperation\nwith devices corresponding to BYOD, so as to enhance the convenience. As an\nexample, cooperation of authentication is a keyword that can be used.\n\n\"Patent Document 1 discloses a technique in which authentication information\nonly needs to be input once, when printing with an image forming apparatus. In\nthe related art described in Patent Document 1, user authentication is\nperformed at the mobile terminal apparatus, and accordingly, print data is\ntransmitted from the mobile terminal apparatus, at which user authentication\nhas been performed, to the image forming apparatus. According to this kind of\nrelated art according to Patent Document 1, from a position that is a\nspecified distance away from a server located near the image forming\napparatus, the print data is transmitted from the mobile terminal apparatus at\nwhich user authentication has been performed, and when the distance from the\nmobile terminal apparatus to the server falls below the specified distance,\nthe image forming apparatus can execute the printing based on the print data.\n\n\"Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.\n2014-167664\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor's summary information for\nthis patent application: \"According to one aspect of the present invention,\nthere is provided an information processing system including an image forming\napparatus; a server; and a mobile terminal apparatus.

BYOD is a form of connecting a mobile terminal apparatus owned by a user to an in-house network and the like, for use in business operations. A mobile terminal apparatus is a portable terminal device such as a smartphone, a mobile phone, a notebook computer and the like. As the use of BYOD increases, it is also necessary for an image forming apparatus to operate in cooperation with devices corresponding to BYOD, so as to enhance the convenience. As an example, cooperation of authentication is a keyword that can be used.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Patent Document 1 discloses a technique in which authentication information only needs to be input once, when printing with an image forming apparatus. In the related art described in Patent Document 1, user authentication is performed at the mobile terminal apparatus, and accordingly, print data is transmitted from the mobile terminal apparatus, at which user authentication has been performed, to the image forming apparatus. According to this kind of related art according to Patent Document 1, from a position that is a specified distance away from a server located near the image forming apparatus, the print data is transmitted from the mobile terminal apparatus at which user authentication has been performed, and when the distance from the mobile terminal apparatus to the server falls below the specified distance, the image forming apparatus can execute the printing based on the print data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2014-167664&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent application: &#8220;According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing system including an image forming apparatus; a server; and a mobile terminal apparatus.
