    "text": "JONESBORO - The Jonesboro Land Bank Commission no longer has a dedicated\nemployee, but Mayor Harold Perrin said the relatively new city agency will\ncontinue to do its work, with the help of other city departments.\n\nJonathan Smith, who had served as land bank director for two years, resigned\nin April to move with his family to Murfreesboro, Tenn.\n\nBecause of the economic downturn created by the coronavirus pandemic and other\nfactors, Perrin said he doesn't plan to search for a replacement.\n\n\"We felt like that, at least for now, we would not have need for a director,\"\nPerrin told the city council's finance and administration committee Tuesday.\nThe committee endorsed a proposal to use part of the land bank salary to\ncreate a new code enforcement officer's position.\n\nTotal annual salary and benefits for the land bank director's position was\n$73,450. The cost of the new code enforcement officer for the remainder of the\nyear would be $24,450.\n\nPerrin said there's a growing need for code enforcement. Michael Tyner,\ndirector of code enforcement, said his four existing code enforcement officers\nare spread thin over 80 square miles.\n\n\"We're running anywhere from 400 to 500 cases a month, and that's not even\nkeeping up,\" Tyner said.\n\nThe land bank commission was established in 2018 to fight blight, increase\nhome ownership, stabilize property values in neighborhoods and provide\naffordable housing. Other goals include improving the health and safety of\nneighborhoods and maintaining the architectural fabric of the community.\n\nThe commission has already acquired property on Drake and North Bridge streets\nthrough donations or redemption of delinquent property, and bought a house on\nWarner Avenue that had become dilapidated.\n\nAt least for the remainder of the year, Planning Director Derrel Smith and his\nstaff will pick up most of Jonathan Smith's former responsibilities. The city\ncollector's office, which is part of the finance department, will pick up\nresponsibility for preparing liens to be filed against property owners who owe\nthe city for code enforcement actions, such as demolition of dilapidated\nbuildings or mowing grass on vacant lots, Perrin said.",

    "html": "<p>JONESBORO - <org>The Jonesboro Land Bank Commission</org> no longer has a dedicated employee, but Mayor <person>Harold Perrin</person> said the relatively new city agency will continue to do its work, with the help of other city departments.</p>\n<p><person>Jonathan Smith</person>, who had served as land bank director for two years, resigned in April to move with his family to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.muroro\">Murfreesboro, Tenn.</location></p>\n\n<p>Because of the economic downturn created by the coronavirus pandemic and other factors, Perrin said he doesn't plan to search for a replacement.</p>\n\n<p>\"We felt like that, at least for now, we would not have need for a director,\" Perrin told the city council's finance and administration committee Tuesday. The committee endorsed a proposal to use part of the land bank salary to create a new code enforcement officer's position.</p>\n\n<p>Total annual salary and benefits for the land bank director's position was <money>$73,450</money>. The cost of the new code enforcement officer for the remainder of the year would be <money>$24,450</money>.</p>\n\n<p>Perrin said there's a growing need for code enforcement. <person>Michael Tyner</person>, director of code enforcement, said his four existing code enforcement officers are spread thin over 80 square miles.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're running anywhere from 400 to 500 cases a month, and that's not even keeping up,\" Tyner said.</p>\n\n<p>The land bank commission was established in 2018 to fight blight, increase home ownership, stabilize property values in neighborhoods and provide affordable housing. Other goals include improving the health and safety of neighborhoods and maintaining the architectural fabric of the community.</p>\n\n<p>The commission has already acquired property on Drake and North Bridge streets through donations or redemption of delinquent property, and bought a house on <location>Warner Avenue</location> that had become dilapidated.</p>\n\n<p>At least for the remainder of the year, Planning Director <person>Derrel Smith</person> and his staff will pick up most of <person>Jonathan Smith's</person> former responsibilities. The city collector's office, which is part of the finance department, will pick up responsibility for preparing liens to be filed against property owners who owe the city for code enforcement actions, such as demolition of dilapidated buildings or mowing grass on vacant lots, Perrin said.</p>",
