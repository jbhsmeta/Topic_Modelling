    "text": "President Trump's entirely counterproductive, even dangerous, response to the\ncurrent nationwide unrest makes even more evident the desperate need for a\nthird candidate of substance to enter the presidential race. The good news?\nThere is still time for such a candidate to emerge.\n\nTrump is divisive, destabilizing, and temperamentally unfit to continue in\noffice. Joe Biden increasingly appears unfit in the more traditional sense of\nthe word while also significantly too beholden to the political Left. The\nnation needs a unifying ticket, one of moral weight and broadly representing\nthe political center, to help restore common purpose in an increasingly\npolarized society.\n\nThe obvious leader of such a ticket would be a military man such as former\nSecretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis or the recently retired Joint Chiefs of\nStaff Chairman Joseph Dunford. Or maybe former Adm. James Stavridis. It's hard\nto think of anyone else who would attract instant respect, although a few\nformer professional athletes who have done impressive things after sports\nretirement (perhaps quarterback Steve Young, with his law degree, business\nsuccess, and philanthropic record) might be able to galvanize a following.\n\nBut let's say it's Dunford, combined with an interesting running mate such as\nformer congressman Artur Davis, a superb public speaker who was too\nconservative for Democrats but too liberal for Republicans (or, to keep the\nsports theme going, former head football coach Tony Dungy -- with his famous\ncalm, decency, and philanthropic work). Or perhaps with a tremendously\nsuccessful business executive such as Pamela Nicholson, who rose from a rental\ncar desk clerk to become CEO of Enterprise, which she led into rapidly\nsuccessful growth.\n\nCritics who say it is too late for a third candidate to emerge are wrong. In\n2016, even after striking out with attempts to get more prominent people such\nas Mattis to run, conservative and centrist Trump critics chose the previously\nunknown former CIA officer Evan McMullin remarkably late, on Aug. 8. Even that\nlate, McMullin was a legal vote in 38 states and was actually listed on the\nballot in about 30.\n\nThen-consultant Joel Searby, who led those ballot-access efforts in 2016,\ntells me that with $1 million with which to organize, a third candidate this\nyear could qualify for 30-35 ballots, and \"with more money, and especially a\nstrong legal team, it's certainly possible someone could get on more than\nthat.\" (Searby is not involved in any such effort this year.)\n\nIt doesn't necessarily matter that such a late-starting candidate may fail to\nget 50-state ballot access. A Democrat is going to win California no matter\nwhat, and a conservative will win Mississippi. What matters is getting on\nballots in states where a third-party competitor might have a chance to win a\nplurality.\n\nWith the right sort of candidate and message, one could easily see our\nmythical candidate winning an interesting conglomeration of states (for\ndifferent reasons) ranging from Maine and New Hampshire in the Northeast to\nthe Mountain Time states of Utah, Montana, Idaho, and both Dakotas -- perhaps\neven to Alaska. Other top-tier targets might include Iowa, Arizona, and New\nMexico.\n\nIf candidate Mattis or Stavridis were to win pluralities (and thus the\nelectoral votes) in enough states to keep Biden or Trump from winning an\nElectoral College majority, then the election would be thrown to the House of\nRepresentatives under a unique set of voting rules. There, almost anything\ncould happen, with new coalitions being built across party lines for one\ncandidate finally to secure the votes of 26 state delegations. The exercise\nitself would be valuable no matter who wins, just by reinvigorating the lost\nspirit of cross-party discussion and cooperation. And it's not at all\nimpossible to see a scenario where the candidate of the middle eventually\nemerges victorious.\n\nThose who say no independent candidate could catch fire are just wrong. In\n1992, businessman Ross Perot actually built a solid polling lead over both the\nelder George Bush and Bill Clinton until Perot began spouting weird conspiracy\ntheories and precipitously withdrew (temporarily) from the race. There's no\nreason, in this year of unrest, why an admired military figure couldn't rocket\nto the top just as Perot did -- and then, unlike the wild-talking Perot,\nactually stay there.\n\nThere are numerous talented political consultants, and even former political\nworkers like me, who could devise strategy memos and media plans for an\nimpressive independent candidate to run a successful campaign. The need and\nopportunity are there: It's time someone takes it.\n\nPhoto Caption:Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis speaks at the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, in New York, Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019.

    "title": "America needs a choice other than Trump or Biden",
    "html": "<p>President Trump&#8217;s entirely counterproductive, even dangerous, response to the current nationwide unrest makes even more evident the desperate need for a third candidate of substance to enter the presidential race. The good news? There is still time for such a candidate to emerge.</p>\n<p>Trump is divisive, destabilizing, and temperamentally unfit to continue in office. <person>Joe Biden</person> increasingly appears unfit in the more traditional sense of the word while also significantly too beholden to the political Left. The nation needs a unifying ticket, one of moral weight and broadly representing the political center, to help restore common purpose in an increasingly polarized society.</p>\n<p>The obvious leader of such a ticket would be a military man such as former Secretary of Defense Gen. <person>James Mattis</person> or the recently retired <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2323059287\">Joint Chiefs of Staff</org> Chairman <person>Joseph Dunford</person>. Or maybe former Adm. <person>James Stavridis</person>. It&#8217;s hard to think of anyone else who would attract instant respect, although a few former professional athletes who have done impressive things after sports retirement (perhaps quarterback <person>Steve Young</person>, with his law degree, business success, and philanthropic record) might be able to galvanize a following.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s Dunford, combined with an interesting running mate such as former congressman <person>Artur Davis</person>, a superb public speaker who was too conservative for <org>Democrats</org> but too liberal for <org>Republicans</org> (or, to keep the sports theme going, former head football coach <person>Tony Dungy</person> &#8212; with his famous calm, decency, and philanthropic work). Or perhaps with a tremendously successful business executive such as <person>Pamela Nicholson</person>, who rose from a rental car desk clerk to become CEO of Enterprise, which she led into rapidly successful growth.</p>\n<p>Critics who say it is too late for a third candidate to emerge are wrong. In 2016, even after striking out with attempts to get more prominent people such as Mattis to run, conservative and centrist Trump critics chose the previously unknown former CIA officer <person>Evan McMullin</person> remarkably late, on <chron>Aug. 8</chron>. Even that late, McMullin was a legal vote in 38 states and was actually listed on the ballot in about 30.</p>\n<p>Then-consultant <person>Joel Searby</person>, who led those ballot-access efforts in 2016, tells me that with <money>$1 million</money> with which to organize, a third candidate this year could qualify for 30-35 ballots, and &#8220;with more money, and especially a strong legal team, it&#8217;s certainly possible someone could get on more than that.&#8221; (Searby is not involved in any such effort this year.)</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t necessarily matter that such a late-starting candidate may fail to get 50-state ballot access. A Democrat is going to win <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> no matter what, and a conservative will win <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ms\">Mississippi</location>. What matters is getting on ballots in states where a third-party competitor might have a chance to win a plurality. </p>\n<p>With the right sort of candidate and message, one could easily see our mythical candidate winning an interesting conglomeration of states (for different reasons) ranging from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.me\">Maine</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nh\">New Hampshire</location> in the Northeast to the Mountain Time states of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ut\">Utah</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mt\">Montana</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.id\">Idaho</location>, and both Dakotas &#8212; perhaps even to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ak\">Alaska</location>. Other top-tier targets might include <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.az\">Arizona</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nm\">New Mexico</location>.</p>\n<p>If candidate Mattis or Stavridis were to win pluralities (and thus the electoral votes) in enough states to keep Biden or Trump from winning an <org>Electoral College</org> majority, then the election would be thrown to the <org>House of Representatives</org> under a unique set of voting rules. There, almost anything could happen, with new coalitions being built across party lines for one candidate finally to secure the votes of 26 state delegations. The exercise itself would be valuable no matter who wins, just by reinvigorating the lost spirit of cross-party discussion and cooperation. And it&#8217;s not at all impossible to see a scenario where the candidate of the middle eventually emerges victorious.</p>\n<p>Those who say no independent candidate could catch fire are just wrong. In 1992, businessman <person>Ross Perot</person> actually built a solid polling lead over both the elder <person>George Bush</person> and <person>Bill Clinton</person> until Perot began spouting weird conspiracy theories and precipitously withdrew (temporarily) from the race. There&#8217;s no reason, in this year of unrest, why an admired military figure couldn&#8217;t rocket to the top just as Perot did &#8212; and then, unlike the wild-talking Perot, actually stay there.</p>\n<p>There are numerous talented political consultants, and even former political workers like me, who could devise strategy memos and media plans for an impressive independent candidate to run a successful campaign. The need and opportunity are there: It&#8217;s time someone takes it.</p><p />\n<p>Photo Caption:Former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Secretary of Defense <person>Jim Mattis</person> speaks at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1564959034\">Council on Foreign Relations</org>, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location>, <chron>Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019</chron>.
