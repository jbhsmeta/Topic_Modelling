    "text": "At some point throughout each day when you are a parent, you can experience\nfrustrating moments with your kids. While this is completely normal and\nsomething that most parents can relate to, you still want to encourage your\nchildren to have fun when spending time with you.\n\nMore often than not, as parents, we spend the majority of our time caring for\nour little ones, as well as trying to stay on top of their behavior. However,\nyou also want to find that balance as a fun parent. Finding the right\nactivities for you and your kids can sometimes seem impossible, so we have put\ntogether 5 ways that you can have more fun with your kids!\n\nAsk Them What They Want to Do\n\nYou will find the activities that you do together will be much more popular\nwith your children if they get a say in them. Too often parents decide what\nfun activities their children are going to engage with each day and forget to\nconsult their little ones on what sort of fun they would like to have.\nTherefore, we recommend that you take the time to consult with your kids and\nplan together the different adventures you can enjoy.\n\nDon't Always Play the Same Games\n\nEven though your kids likely have a toy box full of different games and toys,\nthey are most likely to engage with the same toys, day in, day out. This is\nnot the best way to have fun with your kids and instead, you should be\nencouraging them to try different things.\n\nDon't be afraid to try different games with your kids and even add something\nnew and unique to the toy box. For example, the Japanese versions of these\nPokemon card games offer a great new game for you and your kids to enjoy that\nwill also get their minds engaged and working.\n\nGet Outside\n\nSome of the most fun you will ever have with your children is on days where\nyou get out of the house and explore the big outdoors. Kids love the freedom\nof being outdoors. So, even if you just take a trip down to your local park\nand let them blow off some steam, you will be able to enjoy much happier and\nrelaxed children.\n\nYou can pack a picnic and go exploring around your local woodlands or nature\nreserve for the day or head down to the nearest beach. This will help your\nchildren to learn about new environments and get all the benefits of some\nfresh air.\n\nHave Fun in the Kitchen\n\nMany parents find that trying to get their kids to eat at mealtimes is one of\nthe biggest challenges throughout the day. So why not get your kids involved\nin cooking and have fun in the kitchen? By asking your children what sort of\nfood they want to help you cook in the kitchen and by giving them their own\ntasks and roles in the creation of your evening meal, you will find they are\nmuch more likely to eat once the dish is served!\n\nCombine Playing and Learning\n\nIf you tell your children that you are going to do some learning with them,\nthey are not likely to find it fun or enjoyable. However, research has found\nthat playing does have many developmental benefits. So, by giving your\nchildren the freedom to play, but while also finding activities that are\neducational, you can combine learning and playing together and ensure that you\nare having more fun with your kids!\n\nBy planning together and finding the right activities, you can boost the fun\nyou are having with your kids and help their development at the same time.",

    "title": "5 Ways to Have More Fun with Your Kids",
    "html": "<p>At some point throughout each day when you are a parent, you can experience frustrating moments with your kids. While this is completely normal and something that most parents can relate to, you still want to encourage your children to have fun when spending time with you.</p>\n<p>More often than not, as parents, we spend the majority of our time caring for our little ones, as well as trying to stay on top of their behavior. However, you also want to find that balance as a fun parent. Finding the right activities for you and your kids can sometimes seem impossible, so we have put together 5 ways that you can have more fun with your kids!</p>\n\n<p>Ask Them What They Want to Do</p>\n\n<p>You will find the activities that you do together will be much more popular with your children if they get a say in them. Too often parents decide what fun activities their children are going to engage with each day and forget to consult their little ones on what sort of fun they would like to have. Therefore, we recommend that you take the time to consult with your kids and plan together the different adventures you can enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>Don't Always Play the Same Games</p>\n\n<p>Even though your kids likely have a toy box full of different games and toys, they are most likely to engage with the same toys, day in, day out. This is not the best way to have fun with your kids and instead, you should be encouraging them to try different things.</p>\n\n<p>Don't be afraid to try different games with your kids and even add something new and unique to the toy box. For example, the Japanese versions of these Pok&#233;mon card games offer a great new game for you and your kids to enjoy that will also get their minds engaged and working.</p>\n\n<p>Get Outside</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most fun you will ever have with your children is on days where you get out of the house and explore the big outdoors. Kids love the freedom of being outdoors. So, even if you just take a trip down to your local park and let them blow off some steam, you will be able to enjoy much happier and relaxed children.</p>\n\n<p>You can pack a picnic and go exploring around your local woodlands or nature reserve for the day or head down to the nearest beach. This will help your children to learn about new environments and get all the benefits of some fresh air.</p>\n\n<p>Have Fun in the Kitchen</p>\n\n<p>Many parents find that trying to get their kids to eat at mealtimes is one of the biggest challenges throughout the day. So why not get your kids involved in cooking and have fun in the kitchen? By asking your children what sort of food they want to help you cook in the kitchen and by giving them their own tasks and roles in the creation of your evening meal, you will find they are much more likely to eat once the dish is served!</p>\n\n<p>Combine Playing and Learning</p>\n\n<p>If you tell your children that you are going to do some learning with them, they are not likely to find it fun or enjoyable. However, research has found that playing does have many developmental benefits. So, by giving your children the freedom to play, but while also finding activities that are educational, you can combine learning and playing together and ensure that you are having more fun with your kids!</p>\n\n<p>By planning together and finding the right activities, you can boost the fun you are having with your kids and help their development at the same time.</p>",
