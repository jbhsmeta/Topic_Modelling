    "text": "By Ben Rosario\n\nThe House of Representatives on Thursday, June 4, passed on third and final\nreading the proposed Accelerated Recover and Investments Stimulus for the\nEconomy of the Philippines or ARISE Philippines Act that will earmark P1.31\ntrillion in a bid to jumpstart the economy that has been badly damaged by the\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nRegistering 216 affirmative and seven negative votes, congressmen demonstrated\nstrong support for the landmark measure that Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and\nthe House leadership vigorously supported.\n\nNobody abstained from the voting that took place a day before Congress was set\nto adjourn sine die.\n\nOnly about 25 House members were physically present at the Batasan Pambansa\nplenary hall. The rest of the participants voted electronically.\n\nCayetano stressed that through the ARISE bill, the government will respond to\nthe needs of the workers in non-essential businesses, freelancers, repatriated\noverseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and self-employed workers who may have been\nleft out in the DSWD's social amelioration programs and Small Business Wage\nSubsidy Program.\n\nOn the other hand, Minority Leader and Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante noted\nsome \"imperfections\" on the measure but pointed out the significance of having\nit enacted.\n\nThe Makabayan bloc, composed of six party-list solons, thumbed down the\nmeasure.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this stimulus bill actually reinforces the same, old economic\nprinciples which have hobbled local industrial growth and agricultural\ndevelopment, and that which made our public health system critically impaired\nunder the private sector's hands,\" said Gabriela Women's Party-list Rep.\nArlene Brosas in explaining her \"no\" vote.\n\nFormerly known as the Philippine Economic Stimulus Act (PESA), HB 6815 affirms\nthe commitment of the \"House of the People to pass this landmark measure that\nmay bring back life to the country's economy and mitigate effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic to our hardest hit businesses and sectors.\"\n\nThe bill was sponsored on the floor by Reps. Sharon Garin (AAMBIS Owa\nPartylist), Joey Sarte Salceda (PDP-Laban, Albay), and Stella Luz Quimbo (LP,\nMarikina City).\n\nGarin, chairperson of the House Committee on Economic Reforms, said the whole\nproposal - Transitional, Financial, Sectoral, and Structural - is the\nimmediate response to jumpstart the economy amid the pandemic.\n\nGarin, who is also the co-chair of Subcommittee on Economic Response Package\nCluster of Defeat COVID-19 Committee, cited the urgency of passing the measure\nthat will offer immediate assistance to Filipinos who have lost jobs and other\nmeans of livelihood as a result of the implementation of the enhanced\ncommunity quarantine in many areas in the country.\n\n\"Workers in non-essential businesses, the self-employed, the freelancers and\nOFWs will be given a maximum subsidy of P15,000 per month for two (2) months,\"\nGarin said.\n\nThe bill will implement a wage subsidy program that will address the concerns\nof the self-employed, freelancers, and so-called informal sector.\n\nAccording to Cayetano around 865,000 workers from the film and entertainment\nindustry have been affected and the revenue loss to their sector is expected\nto reach P100 billion this year.\n\nThe House leader said the \"landmark measure\" will also provide immediate\nassistance to displaced workers and businesses including micro, small and\nmedium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) and accelerate investment to boost the\ngovernment's economic recovery plan.\n\nDisplaced workers and repatriated OFWs may also avail themselves of wage\nsubsidies amounting to at least 50% but not more than 75% of the P15,000,\nwhich is the base amount of monthly salary prescribed in the bill.\n\nEach qualified rank-and-file employee may avail himself or herself of a\nmonthly wage subsidy between P7,500 to P11,250 for two months.\n\nThe proposed allocation will also finance the enhanced Build, Build, Build\nprogram that will improve healthcare, educational facilities, social housing\nprojects, digital infrastructure, creative industries and climate-smart and\nresilient infrastructure and other related projects.\n\nIt also allocates P25 billion for the implementation of the Department of\nLabor's TUPAD (Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers)\nprogram to provide temporary employment to displaced workers.\n\nThe proposed economic stimulus budget for year 2020 is P568 billion. The\nremainder, amounting to over P732 billion, will be budgeted for various\nstimulus programs from 2021 until 2023.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\n(MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)",
