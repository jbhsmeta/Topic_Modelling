    "text": "Denver Post sports columnist Mark Kiszla answered questions about all things\nColorado sports in a live chat Monday. Here are the highlights.\n\nKiz, how big of an impact is Jerry Jeudy going to make for us this year? Kid\nlooked amazing last year and everything says he's got the skillset to make it\nat the next level.\n\nKiszla: I'm stoked about Jerry Jeudy. Cannot promise you he will prove to be\nthe best wide receiver in this draft. But he has definitely got a chance.\nCourtland Sutton has Pro Bowl skills, yet I don't think he's quite at the\nlevel of a game-changer. Jeudy could be a game-changer. And if Sutton proves\nto be the Broncos' No. 2 pass-target, then quarterback Drew Lock will be a\nvery happy man.\n\nWhy are you so against John Elway and his draft picks? It seems that every\ntime he makes a pick you are the first one to say, huh, what was he thinking?\nAre you really that set against taking KJ Hamler in the second round?\n\nKiszla: Well, I just said I was stoked about Jeudy. Said it before the draft,\ngave it a big thumbs up on opening night of the draft. So maybe you're fudging\nabout my evaluation. But you're right about one thing: Unlike many sports\njournalists in this dusty old cowtown, I don't kiss Mr. Elway's rings. Through\nthe years I've bashed Elway for taking Brock Osweiler rather Russell Wilson in\nthe draft (how'd that turn out?) and I praised Elway for drafting Paxton Lynch\n(my bad). I told ya Royce Freeman was reach and got really excited about\nPhillip Lindsay from the instant he signed with the team as a free agent. My\ncolleague Ryan O'Halloran, who certainly knows his football, enthusiastically\ngave Elway an \"A\" grade for the 2020 draft. I thought Elway lost his way on\nDay 2. I was fond of Hamler as player at Penn State, as I mentioned prior to\nthe draft. But on a team that could use help immediate help in the secondary,\nI don't see Hamler getting a lot of touches as a rookie in this offense.\n\nWhy are the Dodgers so much better than Rockies at drafting and developing\nyoung players?\n\nKiszla: The Rockies want you to believe the Dodgers buy their championships.\nThe money helps. But the Dodgers also have flexed more brainpower in the\ndraft. That the Rockies have not been able to draft and develop a replacement\nfor Todd Helton at first base is beyond perplexing to me. (And that's me being\nnice.) But in a Broncos town, the baseball sins and misdeeds in LoDo are\nquickly forgotten or downright ignored by the masses. And when somebody like\nme points them out, I'm often told to sit back and enjoy the sunshine at Coors\nField, because fretting about the final score shouldn't matter. This is not a\ndemanding baseball town. Cool by me. As we've seen lately, this town has far\nbigger problems than where the Rockies wind up in the standings.\n\nHey Kiz, thanks for the chat. MLB says 80 games. MLBPA proposes 114 with games\ngoing into November. I can't wait to see the Red Sox and Yankees game on\nThanksgiving. The players want closer to full salary and a year of service\ntime, in the latter case even if a player decides to stay at home. Then they\nget to repeat the dance around the CBA soon after. While do you think are the\ncooler heads, and is there a reasonable chance we'll see meaningful baseball\nany time soon?\n\nKiszla: Major-league baseball needs to buy a vowel  and a clue. I don't have\ntime for no stinkin' money spat in a country where there are riots in the\nstreets, shuttered businesses and grandmas and grandpas afraid to breathe, let\nalone go outside.No that being said, I think the financial burden should fall\nmore on franchise owners than players to resume the season. But suggesting MLB\ntry to squeeze in 114 regular-season games in 2020 seems out of touch with\nreality. Will cooler heads prevail? I hope so. But I'm not counting on it.\n\nKiz, it looks like the Avs are favored to win the Stanley Cup if the season\ntruly returns. What says you?\n\nOf the major pro sports, which are you most excited to see return and why?\n\nKiszla: Well, America needs its football. They call this Broncos Country, not\nAvs Country. I understand and respect that. But, from a local perspective, I\nwant to see how far Nikola Jokic or Nathan MacKinnon can go in the playoffs.\nTo tell you the truth, if the Rockies do not take the field in 2020, I will\nfeel empathy for folks who love baseball. But I will not miss the Rockies for\neven half a heartbeat if a money squabble means there will be no baseball and\n20th and Blake this year.\n\nWhy does the Denver media kiss Elway's butt? He's been an awful GM for 5 years\nnow. Vegas has them at 7.5 wins. Drafts have been terrible except for 2\nplayers in 2018 and maybe 3 in 2019, but before that was sooo bad. But now\nhe's drafting team captains that can't start, so he's really found his stride.\nNationally the Broncos are an afterthought with no owner. Is the Denver media\nblind?\n\nKiszla: Well, follow the money. If a media outlet is a business partner with\nthe Broncos, then the money limits the amount of criticism and objectivity\nthat can be broadcast/telecast/reported. Those outlets will break news on the\nBroncos, and I respect the journalists that work for those outlets, but I'm\nglad I don't have to feel beholden to Mr. Elway or the team when covering a\nstory. Other journalists have become more interested in Twitter and Facebook\nlikes than criticizing Von Miller. And I get that, because a thumbs-up on\nTwitter is part of the way the journalistic game is played now. During a\ndifficult 2018 season for the Broncos, a prominent player took my colleague\nRyan O'Halloran aside and asked: Why are you and Kiz the only ones who come in\nthis locker room and ask us hard questions? Well, Mr. O'Halloran and I are\nblessed to work in a sport department where we feel far more obligation to try\nto tell fans what is really going on with this team than to make you feel good\nabout this NFL team.\n\n\\------------\n\nHey, it hasn't been the an easy month -- or year -- for you or me. So I really\nappreciate y'all dropping by to talk sports. Be safe. And be kind to each\nother.Got time for another question or two. Fire away if so inclined. Thanks\nfor being here.Well, follow the money. If a media outlet is a business partner\nwith the Broncos, then the money limits the amount of criticism and\nobjectivity that can be broadcast/telecast/reported. Those outets will break\nnews on the Broncos, and I respect the journalists that work for those\noutlets, but I'm glad I don't have to feel beholden to Mr. Elway or the team\nwhen covering a story. Other journalists have become more interested in\nTwitter and Facebooks likes than criticizing Von Miller. And I get that,\nbecause a thumbs-up on Twitter is part of the way the journalistic game is\nplayed now. During a difficult 2018 season for the Broncos, a prominent player\ntook my colleague Ryan O'Halloran aside and asked: Why are you and Kiz the\nonly ones who come in this locker room and ask us hard questions? Well, Mr.\nO'Halloran and I are blessed to work in a sport department where we feel far\nmore obligation to try to tell fans what is really going on with this team\nthan to make you feel good about this NFL team.Why does the Denver media kiss\nElway's butt? He's been an awful GM for 5 years now. Vegas has them at 7.5\nwins. Drafts have been terrible except for 2 players in 2018 and maybe 3 in\n2019, but before that was sooo bad. But now he's drafting team captains that\ncan't start, so he's really found his stride. Nationally the Broncos are an\nafterthought with no owner. Is the Denver media blind?Let's start here: I hope\nthere are games for you to enjoy and me to cover. If there are, then the\naccess available to me or other sports journalists is a trivial matter\ncompared to the illness and financial hardships endured by so many U.S.\nfamilies in 2020. But part of the job I enjoy the most is the give-and-take\nwith athletes in the locker room, the ability to ask hard questions that I\nthink some fans want answered and the space to go look for a story line beyond\nthe most obvious. I do believe all those things will become bigger challenges\nas the old way of doing things for sports journalists transforms into the new\nnormal. For example: If the NBA finishes its season at a single site in\nOrlando, how many journalists will even be allowed to attend the games and\npractices in person?I admire your enthusiasm. But if I'm the DC for a team\nthat plays the Broncos, I'm going to focus on that offensive line, tear it\napart and knock quarterback Drew Lock on his butt all game long. You're\nabsolutely correct: The Broncos offense should score more points ... if the\noffensive line can keep Lock from running for his life.While I don't qualify\nas a deeply religious man, if you are a firm believer in the power of prayer,\nthen Michael Porter Jr is absolutely right: The victims of social injustice\nand the perpetrators of social injustice both could use a healthy measure of\nGod's grace, no matter who your God might be.Well, America needs its football.\nThey call this Broncos Country, not Avs Country. I understand and respect\nthat. But, from a local perspective, I want to see how far Nikola Jokic or\nNathan MacKinnon can go in the playoffs. To tell you the truth, if the Rockies\ndo not take the field in 2020, I will feel empathy for folks who love\nbaseball. But I will not miss the Rockies for even half a heartbeat if a money\nsquabble means there will be no baseball and 20th and Blake this year.Of the\nmajor pro sports, which are you most excited to see return and why?I'd love to\nsee a 114 game season with expanded rosters, taxi squad and an insane amount\nof double headers. Let's do this! I needs me some Chuck Nazty!The Avs are the\nfavorites? Easy there, big fella. They certainly have shot. But after such a\nlong hiatus forced by the coronavirus, when (and if) the NHL gets back on the\nice, I think this 24-team tourney might well be unpredictable and full of\nupsets. Which could be pure, zany fun, unless you're a fan of one of the\nfavorites that gets bounced far short of the Stanley Cup finals.Kiz, it looks\nlike the Avs are favored to win the Stanley Cup if the season truly returns.\nWhat says you?Major-league baseball needs to buy a vowel ... and a clue. I\ndon't have time for no stinkin' money spat in a country where there are riots\nin the streets, shuttered businesses and grandmas and grandpas afraid to\nbreathe, let alone go outside.No that being said, I think the financial burden\nshould fall more on franchise owners than players to resume the season. But\nsuggesting MLB try to squeeze in 114 regular-season games in 2020 seems out of\ntouch with reality. Will cooler heads prevail? I hope so.

    "title": "Lunch Special: Is Broncos rookie wide receiver Jerry Jeudy the real deal?",
    "html": "<p><person>Denver Post</person> sports columnist <person>Mark Kiszla</person> answered questions about all things <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location> sports in a live chat Monday. Here are the highlights.</p>\n<p>Kiz, how big of an impact is <person>Jerry Jeudy</person> going to make for us this year? Kid looked amazing last year and everything says he's got the skillset to make it at the next level.</p>\n\n<p>Kiszla: I'm stoked about <person>Jerry Jeudy</person>. Cannot promise you he will prove to be the best wide receiver in this draft. But he has definitely got a chance. <person>Courtland Sutton</person> has Pro Bowl skills, yet I don't think he's quite at the level of a game-changer. Jeudy could be a game-changer. And if Sutton proves to be the Broncos' No. 2 pass-target, then quarterback <person>Drew Lock</person> will be a very happy man.</p>\n\n<p>Why are you so against <person>John Elway</person> and his draft picks? It seems that every time he makes a pick you are the first one to say, huh, what was he thinking? Are you really that set against taking KJ Hamler in the second round?</p>\n\n<p>Kiszla: Well, I just said I was stoked about Jeudy. Said it before the draft, gave it a big thumbs up on opening night of the draft. So maybe you're fudging about my evaluation. But you're right about one thing: Unlike many sports journalists in this dusty old cowtown, I don't kiss <person>Mr. Elway's</person> &#133; rings. Through the years I've bashed Elway for taking <person>Brock Osweiler</person> rather <person>Russell Wilson</person> in the draft (how'd that turn out?) and I praised Elway for drafting <person>Paxton Lynch</person> (my bad). I told ya <person>Royce Freeman</person> was reach and got really excited about <person>Phillip Lindsay</person> from the instant he signed with the team as a free agent. My colleague <person>Ryan O'Halloran</person>, who certainly knows his football, enthusiastically gave Elway an \"A\" grade for the 2020 draft. I thought Elway lost his way on Day 2. I was fond of Hamler as player at Penn State, as I mentioned prior to the draft. But on a team that could use help immediate help in the secondary, I don't see Hamler getting a lot of touches as a rookie in this offense.</p>\n\n<p>Why are the <org>Dodgers</org> so much better than Rockies at drafting and developing young players?</p>\n\n<p>Kiszla: The Rockies want you to believe the <org>Dodgers</org> buy their championships. The money helps. But the <org>Dodgers</org> also have flexed more brainpower in the draft. That the Rockies have not been able to draft and develop a replacement for <person>Todd Helton</person> at first base is beyond perplexing to me. (And that's me being nice.) But in a Broncos town, the baseball sins and misdeeds in LoDo are quickly forgotten or downright ignored by the masses. And when somebody like me points them out, I'm often told to sit back and enjoy the sunshine at <location>Coors Field</location>, because fretting about the final score shouldn't matter. This is not a demanding baseball town. Cool by me. As we've seen lately, this town has far bigger problems than where the Rockies wind up in the standings.</p>\n\n<p>Hey Kiz, thanks for the chat. MLB says 80 games. MLBPA proposes 114 with games going into November. I can't wait to see the Red Sox and Yankees game on <chron>Thanksgiving</chron>. The players want closer to full salary and a year of service time, in the latter case even if a player decides to stay at home. Then they get to repeat the dance around the CBA soon after. While do you think are the cooler heads, and is there a reasonable chance we'll see meaningful baseball any time soon?</p>\n\n<p>Kiszla: Major-league baseball needs to buy a vowel &#133; and a clue. I don't have time for no stinkin' money spat in a country where there are riots in the streets, shuttered businesses and grandmas and grandpas afraid to breathe, let alone go outside.No that being said, I think the financial burden should fall more on franchise owners than players to resume the season. But suggesting MLB try to squeeze in 114 regular-season games in 2020 seems out of touch with reality. Will cooler heads prevail? I hope so. But I'm not counting on it.</p>\n\n<p>Kiz, it looks like the Avs are favored to win the Stanley Cup if the season truly returns. What says you?</p>\n\n<p>Of the major pro sports, which are you most excited to see return and why?</p>\n\n<p>Kiszla: Well, America needs its football. They call this Broncos Country, not Avs Country. I understand and respect that. But, from a local perspective, I want to see how far <person>Nikola Jokic</person> or <person>Nathan MacKinnon</person> can go in the playoffs. To tell you the truth, if the Rockies do not take the field in 2020, I will feel empathy for folks who love baseball. But I will not miss the Rockies for even half a heartbeat if a money squabble means there will be no baseball and 20th and Blake this year.</p>\n\n<p>Why does the Denver media kiss Elway's butt? He's been an awful <org>GM</org> for 5 years now. Vegas has them at 7.5 wins. Drafts have been terrible except for 2 players in 2018 and maybe 3 in 2019, but before that was sooo bad. But now he's drafting team captains that can't start, so he's really found his stride. Nationally the Broncos are an afterthought with no owner. Is the Denver media blind?</p>\n\n<p>Kiszla: Well, follow the money. If a media outlet is a business partner with the Broncos, then the money limits the amount of criticism and objectivity that can be broadcast/telecast/reported. Those outlets will break news on the Broncos, and I respect the journalists that work for those outlets, but I'm glad I don't have to feel beholden to <person>Mr. Elway</person> or the team when covering a story. Other journalists have become more interested in Twitter and Facebook likes than criticizing Von Miller. And I get that, because a thumbs-up on Twitter is part of the way the journalistic game is played now. During a difficult 2018 season for the Broncos, a prominent player took my colleague <person>Ryan O'Halloran</person> aside and asked: Why are you and Kiz the only ones who come in this locker room and ask us hard questions? Well, <person>Mr. O'Halloran</person> and I are blessed to work in a sport department where we feel far more obligation to try to tell fans what is really going on with this team than to make you feel good about this <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> team.</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p>Hey, it hasn't been the an easy month -- or year -- for you or me. So I really appreciate y'all dropping by to talk sports. Be safe. And be kind to each other.Got time for another question or two. Fire away if so inclined. Thanks for being here.Well, follow the money. If a media outlet is a business partner with the Broncos, then the money limits the amount of criticism and objectivity that can be broadcast/telecast/reported.

But now he's drafting team captains that can't start, so he's really found his stride. Nationally the Broncos are an afterthought with no owner. Is the Denver media blind?Let's start here: I hope there are games for you to enjoy and me to cover. If there are, then the access available to me or other sports journalists is a trivial matter compared to the illness and financial hardships endured by so many <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> families in 2020. But part of the job I enjoy the most is the give-and-take with athletes in the locker room, the ability to ask hard questions that I think some fans want answered and the space to go look for a story line beyond the most obvious. I do believe all those things will become bigger challenges as the old way of doing things for sports journalists transforms into the new normal. For example: If the NBA finishes its season at a single site in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location>, how many journalists will even be allowed to attend the games and practices in person?I admire your enthusiasm. But if I'm the DC for a team that plays the Broncos, I'm going to focus on that offensive line, tear it apart and knock quarterback <person>Drew Lock</person> on his butt all game long. You're absolutely correct: The Broncos offense should score more points ... if the offensive line can keep Lock from running for his life.While I don't qualify as a deeply religious man, if you are a firm believer in the power of prayer, then <person>Michael Porter Jr</person> is absolutely right: The victims of social injustice and the perpetrators of social injustice both could use a healthy measure of God's grace, no matter who your God might be.Well, America needs its football. They call this Broncos Country, not Avs Country. I understand and respect that. But, from a local perspective, I want to see how far <person>Nikola Jokic</person> or <person>Nathan MacKinnon</person> can go in the playoffs. To tell you the truth, if the Rockies do not take the field in 2020, I will feel empathy for folks who love baseball. But I will not miss the Rockies for even half a heartbeat if a money squabble means there will be no baseball and 20th and Blake this year.Of the major pro sports, which are you most excited to see return and why?I'd love to see a 114 game season with expanded rosters, taxi squad and an insane amount of double headers. Let's do this! I needs me some Chuck Nazty!The Avs are the favorites? Easy there, big fella. They certainly have shot. But after such a long hiatus forced by the coronavirus, when (and if) the NHL gets back on the ice, I think this 24-team tourney might well be unpredictable and full of upsets. Which could be pure, zany fun, unless you're a fan of one of the favorites that gets bounced far short of the Stanley Cup finals.Kiz, it looks like the Avs are favored to win the Stanley Cup if the season truly returns.
