    "text": "LATAM\n\nLATAM Becomes Largest Airline to File for Bankruptcy Amid CCP Virus\n\nLATAM Airlines Group SA filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection, becoming the\nlargest carrier to seek an emergency reorganization amid the CCP (Chinese\nCommunist Party) virus crisis.\n\nLatin America's largest airline follows rival Avianca Holdings of Colombia in\nseeking U.S. bankruptcy protection.\n\nBut unlike Avianca, Chile's LATAM posted profits for four consecutive years\ntotaling more than $700 million. It had recently approved a dividend payment.\n\nLATAM laid off 1,800 employees out of over 40,000 in the lead-up to its\nbankruptcy filing.\n\n\\- From Reuters\n\nAMTRAK\n\nUS Passenger Railroad Service Amtrak Says Needs New $1.5 Billion Bailout\n\nU.S. passenger railroad service Amtrak told Congress in a letter made public\nit needs a further $1.475 billion bailout, or it will be forced to make\nsweeping service cuts and suspend some routes.\n\nThe company, which has been devastated by the CCP virus pandemic, in April\nreceived $1 billion in emergency funding. Amtrak said it also plans to reduce\nits operating costs by approximately $500 million, including by restructuring\nits workforce and controlling discretionary expenses.\n\nWithout the additional emergency funding, Amtrak said that it would need to\nsuspend some longdistance routes and that others would operate on a thinned-\ndown schedule. It would also need to greatly reduce its high-speed Acela\nservice.\n\n\\- From Reuters\n\nHERTZ\n\nHertz Awards Over $16 Million in Retention Bonus to Key Executives\n\nU.S. car rental company Hertz Global Holdings said it has paid about $16.2\nmillion in retention bonuses to a range of key executives at the director\nlevel and above, days after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe company paid President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Stone $700,000 and\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson $600,000\nas retention bonuses, Hertz said in a filing to the U.S. regulators.\n\n\\- From Reuters\n\nAPPLE\n\nApple to Reopen About 100 Stores in US, Most With Curbside Pickup\n\nApple Inc. said that it plans to reopen about 100 stores in the United States,\nmost with curbside pickup but some with walk-in service.\n\nApple shuttered stores around the world as the CCP virus pandemic spread but\nhas slowly opened them again, saying it examines local health data to make\ndecisions on a store-by-store basis. Earlier this month, the company reopened\na handful of stores in Alaska, Idaho, and Alabama.\n\n\\- From Reuters\n\nSIX FLAGS\n\nSix Flags to Reopen First Theme Park on June 5\n\nThe first Six Flags in the nation to reopen after months will be the location\nin Oklahoma City, a company official announced.\n\nIt's pretty exciting, Trevor Leonard, general manager of Frontier City Six\nFlags, said during an appearance on NBC's Today show. Things are going to look\na little different in the park when you get here.\n\nEvery person who wants to enter the park will have to make a reservation.\nCustomers will be screened en masse by a new system after presenting\nthemselves at the front gate. And marks in lines for rides will force family\nunits to remain 6 feet from each other.\n\n\\- By Zachary Stieber",
