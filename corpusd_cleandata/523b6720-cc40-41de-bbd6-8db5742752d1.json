    "text": "What happened?\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed that the government is working on\na coronavirus-tracking app designed to trace outbreaks and warn people who may\nhave been infected.\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to sweep the globe, nations are focusing on two\npreventative measures: testing and tracing - and with a global shortage of\ntests, effort is going into developing ways to trace the highly infectious\nvirus.\n\nCreated by NHSX, the digital arm of the National Health Service, the\ncontacttracing app will let users indicate when they're potentially\nexperiencing symptoms of the virus. The app can then send out a yellow alert\nto anyone who may have had extended contact with the user. If that user tests\npositive for the coronavirus, contacts receive a second, red alert advising\nthem to place themselves in quarantine.\n\nUniversity of Oxford researchers have pitched such an app to NHSX. Dr David\nBosnall, one of the project's leaders, says: \"the mobile app concept we've\nmathematically modelled is simple and doesn't need to track your location. It\nuses a low-energy version of Bluetooth to log a memory of all the app users\nwith whom you have come into close proximity over the last few days\".\n\nThe UK government is not alone. Following South Korea's lead, a number of\nother countries are also preparing to unveil tracing apps. Germany, France and\nAustria will reportedly have tracing apps 'ready in weeks', while Ireland's\nown app is expected shortly.\n\nHow will it affect you?\n\nIn theory, a contact-tracing app should help you avoid contracting COVID-19.\nHowever, it's thought that at least 60% of the UK population would need to use\nthe app for it to be even moderately useful. Given it's intended to work on\nmost, though not all, smartphones, we can expect a heavy push once it rolls\nout, so make sure you have storage space on your device - it could help save\nlives, including your own.\n\nWhat do we think?\n\nTracing the spread of the coronavirus is vital - but we need assurances that\nour data won't be misused. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at\nthe University of Cambridge and an NHS privacy and security consultant, has\nalready highlighted possible privacy problems. He suggests the system could be\nopen to abuse, saying people \"will instantly realise that a voluntary app\noperated by anonymous actors is wide open to trolling\". This app demands a\nthoughtful approach if it's to succeed in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nWe'll take a closer look at contact-tracing apps in next issue's FAQ.",

    "html": "<p>What happened?</p>\n<p>Health Secretary <person>Matt Hancock</person> has confirmed that the government is working on a coronavirus-tracking app designed to trace outbreaks and warn people who may have been infected.</p>\n<p>As COVID-19 continues to sweep the globe, nations are focusing on two preventative measures: testing and tracing - and with a global shortage of tests, effort is going into developing ways to trace the highly infectious virus.</p>\n<p>Created by NHSX, the digital arm of the National Health Service, the contacttracing app will let users indicate when they're potentially experiencing symptoms of the virus. The app can then send out a yellow alert to anyone who may have had extended contact with the user. If that user tests positive for the coronavirus, contacts receive a second, red alert advising them to place themselves in quarantine.</p>\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0831846225\">University of Oxford</org> researchers have pitched such an app to NHSX. Dr David Bosnall, one of the project's leaders, says: \"the mobile app concept we've mathematically modelled is simple and doesn't need to track your location. It uses a low-energy version of Bluetooth to log a memory of all the app users with whom you have come into close proximity over the last few days\".</p>\n<p>The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> government is not alone. Following <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kr\">South Korea's</location> lead, a number of other countries are also preparing to unveil tracing apps. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/fr\">France</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/at\">Austria</location> will reportedly have tracing apps 'ready in weeks', while <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ie\">Ireland's</location> own app is expected shortly.</p>\n<p>How will it affect you?</p>\n<p>In theory, a contact-tracing app should help you avoid contracting COVID-19. However, it's thought that at least 60% of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> population would need to use the app for it to be even moderately useful. Given it's intended to work on most, though not all, smartphones, we can expect a heavy push once it rolls out, so make sure you have storage space on your device - it could help save lives, including your own.</p>\n<p>What do we think?</p>\n<p>Tracing the spread of the coronavirus is vital - but we need assurances that our data won't be misused. <person>Ross Anderson</person>, professor of security engineering at the <org>University of Cambridge</org> and an <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0318615332\">NHS</org> privacy and security consultant, has already highlighted possible privacy problems. He suggests the system could be open to abuse, saying people \"will instantly realise that a voluntary app operated by anonymous actors is wide open to trolling\". This app demands a thoughtful approach if it's to succeed in the fight against COVID-19.</p>\n<p>We'll take a closer look at contact-tracing apps in next issue's FAQ.</p>",
