    "text": "What happened?\n\nMicrosoft has issued another update for Windows 10, and yet again it has a\nbug. The automatic update, which included new antivirus definitions for\nidentifying malware, contained a flaw that stopped Windows Defender working.\nUsers reported that when they tried to run a full-system scan, the built-in\nsecurity software would crash and show a series of error messages.\n\nThe flaw had a simple cause: a file in the updated code had two dots between\nits name and extension type, rather than one. That was enough to wreak havoc\nfor Windows users, who reported a stream of messages that demanded the PC be\nrestarted or told the user to try the scan again. The error messages were\nconfusing, but more worrying was the inability to run scans, which could leave\nvirus infections undetected and put users who depend on Defender for security\nat risk.\n\nHow will it affect you?\n\nIf you've experienced this problem after installing the update, the good news\nis that there's already a fix. Microsoft quickly pushed out a new update that\nfixes the problem, so if you have automatic updates running (which you\nshould), the issue should rectify itself. If you're still receiving Windows\nDefender error messages and the software crashes during full scans, head to\nthe Windows Security app and click 'Check for updates'. That will tell you\nwhether or not your version is up to date, and let you install a bug fix.\n\nWhat do we think?\n\nMicrosoft issues a constant stream of updates, so it's no wonder some go awry,\nbut this seems to be happening much too often lately. Continued problems of\nthis sort could lead people to postpone updates, leaving them unprotected. We\nshouldn't have to make such tradeoffs. Microsoft needs to boost its quality\ncontrol. Mistakes happen, but they're happening too often at the moment.",

    "html": "<p>What happened?</p>\n<p>Microsoft has issued another update for Windows 10, and yet again it has a bug. The automatic update, which included new antivirus definitions for identifying malware, contained a flaw that stopped Windows Defender working. Users reported that when they tried to run a full-system scan, the built-in security software would crash and show a series of error messages.</p>\n<p>The flaw had a simple cause: a file in the updated code had two dots between its name and extension type, rather than one. That was enough to wreak havoc for Windows users, who reported a stream of messages that demanded the PC be restarted or told the user to try the scan again. The error messages were confusing, but more worrying was the inability to run scans, which could leave virus infections undetected and put users who depend on Defender for security at risk.</p>\n<p>How will it affect you?</p>\n<p>If you've experienced this problem after installing the update, the good news is that there's already a fix. Microsoft quickly pushed out a new update that fixes the problem, so if you have automatic updates running (which you should), the issue should rectify itself. If you're still receiving Windows Defender error messages and the software crashes during full scans, head to the Windows Security app and click 'Check for updates'. That will tell you whether or not your version is up to date, and let you install a bug fix.</p>\n<p>What do we think?</p>\n<p>Microsoft issues a constant stream of updates, so it's no wonder some go awry, but this seems to be happening much too often lately. Continued problems of this sort could lead people to postpone updates, leaving them unprotected. We shouldn't have to make such tradeoffs. Microsoft needs to boost its quality control. Mistakes happen, but they're happening too often at the moment.</p>",
