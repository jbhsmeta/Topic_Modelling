    "text": "Nearly 200 protesters gathered in front of Auburn City Hall on Sunday to\nhighlight what organizers say was a racially charged arrest, tasing and the\nongoing persecution of a former Placer High School football player.\n\nDalton Dyer, a 28-year-old Auburn man, faces three felony counts and two\nstrikes stemming from an altercation with two police officers in October 2018\nthat is headed to a Placer County courtroom this month.\n\nPolice and prosecutors allege Dyer, one of the relatively few black men in\nAuburn, resisted arrest and assaulted an officer, causing bodily harm during\nthe late-night confrontation. Dyer claims he was the one assaulted by the\nofficers.\n\n\"The charges are outrageous,\" Dyer said last week. \"It's a complete\nfabrication.\"\n\nProtesters remained peaceful Sunday, holding signs in support of Dyer and the\nBlack Lives Matter movement and chanting, \"We want change,\" \"No justice, no\npeace, no racist police,\" \"Dalton's life matters, black lives matter.\"\n\n\"I can't even put into words how grateful and thankful I am of the community,\"\nDyer said at the protest. \"Everybody showed up from all walks of life. I\ncouldn't have asked for a better crowd.\"\n\nDyer, addressing the crowd, called for the Auburn Police Department and\nDepartment of Justice to be held accountable.\n\n\"We want justice and we want change. We all talk about it, now let's take\naction and all do our part,\" he said. \"This is a start for this small\ncommunity.\"\n\nTomas Evangelista, who helped run the protest, led the protesters in chants as\ncars honked their horns in support. While addressing the crowd, Evangelista\nencouraged people to sign an online petition in support of Dyer and give money\nto his Go Fund Me.\n\n\"We want the city council to know that he's not alone,\" Evangelista said. \"We\nwant the charges dropped.\"\n\nA [Change.org](http://Change.org) Justice for Dalton petition collected more\nthan 20,000 signatures in its first 48 hours online this week, demanding\ncharges be dropped. A corresponding Go Fund Me page has raised more than\n$12,000 for Dyer's defense fund.\n\nJoey Montoya, the football coach at Placer High and a legal guardian to Dyer\nwhen he attended Placer, said Dyer's incident with the police was an eye-\nopening experience for him.\n\n\"We understand the tough spot the cops are in,\" Montoya said. \"This is not an\nanti-cop speech \u0096 this is a call to change.\"\n\nIf convicted on the current charges, Dyer faces years in prison. But he says\nhe won't take a previously offered plea deal, even if it means no jail time.\n\n\"I'm not pleading guilty to something I didn't do,\" he said. \"I'm completely\ninnocent.\"",

    "html": "<p>Nearly 200 protesters gathered in front of <location>Auburn City Hall</location> on Sunday to highlight what organizers say was a racially charged arrest, tasing and the ongoing persecution of a former Placer High School football player.</p>\n<p><person>Dalton Dyer</person>, a 28-year-old Auburn man, faces three felony counts and two strikes stemming from an altercation with two police officers in <chron>October 2018</chron> that is headed to a Placer County courtroom this month.</p>\n\n<p>Police and prosecutors allege Dyer, one of the relatively few black men in Auburn, resisted arrest and assaulted an officer, causing bodily harm during the late-night confrontation. Dyer claims he was the one assaulted by the officers.</p>\n\n<p>\"The charges are outrageous,\" Dyer said last week. \"It's a complete fabrication.\"</p>\n\n<p>Protesters remained peaceful Sunday, holding signs in support of Dyer and the <org>Black Lives Matter</org> movement and chanting, \"We want change,\" \"No justice, no peace, no racist police,\" \"Dalton's life matters, black lives matter.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I can't even put into words how grateful and thankful I am of the community,\" Dyer said at the protest. \"Everybody showed up from all walks of life. I couldn't have asked for a better crowd.\"</p>\n\n<p>Dyer, addressing the crowd, called for the <org>Auburn Police Department</org> and <org>Department of Justice</org> to be held accountable.</p>\n\n<p>\"We want justice and we want change. We all talk about it, now let's take action and all do our part,\" he said. \"This is a start for this small community.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Tomas Evangelista</person>, who helped run the protest, led the protesters in chants as cars honked their horns in support. While addressing the crowd, Evangelista encouraged people to sign an online petition in support of Dyer and give money to his Go Fund Me.</p>\n\n<p>\"We want the city council to know that he's not alone,\" Evangelista said. \"We want the charges dropped.\"</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://Change.org\">Change.org</a> Justice for Dalton petition collected more than 20,000 signatures in its first 48 hours online this week, demanding charges be dropped. A corresponding Go Fund Me page has raised more than <money>$12,000</money> for Dyer's defense fund.</p>\n\n<p><person>Joey Montoya</person>, the football coach at <org>Placer High</org> and a legal guardian to Dyer when he attended Placer, said Dyer's incident with the police was an eye-opening experience for him.</p>\n\n<p>\"We understand the tough spot the cops are in,\" Montoya said. \"This is not an anti-cop speech &#150; this is a call to change.\"</p>\n\n<p>If convicted on the current charges, Dyer faces years in prison. But he says he won't take a previously offered plea deal, even if it means no jail time.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm not pleading guilty to something I didn't do,\" he said. \"I'm completely innocent.\"</p>",
