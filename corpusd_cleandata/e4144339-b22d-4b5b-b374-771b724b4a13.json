Depositary interests representing shares will also continue\nto trade on AIM of the London Stock Exchange plc under the symbol \"CMCL\".Since\nthe Company's shares were listed on the NYSE American in 2017, trading on that\nmarket has become increasingly dominant, and it now provides the most liquid\nmarket for Caledonia's shares. Accordingly, the Company believes that the\nfinancial and administrative costs associated with maintaining its listing on\nthe TSX are no longer justified.Shareholders holding shares in Canadian\nbrokerage accounts should contact their brokers to confirm how to trade in\nCaledonia's shares in the future on NYSE American or through depositary\ninterests on AIM.For further information please contact:Related ArticlesMore\narticles issued byMore articles related to:Company AnnouncementStock Market\nNews",

Depositary interests representing shares will also continue to trade on AIM of the <org>London Stock Exchange plc</org> under the symbol \"CMCL\".Since the Company&#8217;s shares were listed on the NYSE American in 2017, trading on that market has become increasingly dominant, and it now provides the most liquid market for Caledonia&#8217;s shares. Accordingly, the Company believes that the financial and administrative costs associated with maintaining its listing on the TSX are no longer justified.Shareholders holding shares in Canadian brokerage accounts should contact their brokers to confirm how to trade in Caledonia&#8217;s shares in the future on NYSE American or through depositary interests on AIM.For further information please contact:Related ArticlesMore articles issued byMore articles related to:<org>Company AnnouncementStock Market News</org></p>",
