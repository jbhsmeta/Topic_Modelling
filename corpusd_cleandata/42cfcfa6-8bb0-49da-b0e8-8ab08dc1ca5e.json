    "text": "The door has opened for the return of high school sports.\n\nJust not all at once and not all with the same regulations.\n\nThe sports have been broken into four groups:\n\nLow-touch indoor: Archery, bowling, Esports, swimming and diving.\n\nLow-touch outdoor: Baseball, bass fishing, cross country, golf, softball,\ntennis, track and field.\n\nHigh-touch indoor: Basketball, competitive cheer, dance, volleyball, wrestling\n\nHigh-touch outdoor: Field hockey, football, soccer.\n\nCoaches can meet with players on campuses beginning Monday with groups of 10\npeople or less and safety guidelines must be followed.\n\nThere will be no practices in any sport from Monday through June 14.\n\nHigh-touch sports can begin workouts and exercises in small groups effective\nJune 15, but practices will not be allowed until June 29.\n\nCross country can begin practices June 15 with competition being allowed June\n29.\n\nThe KHSAA Board of Control voted 13-5 Thursday to eliminate the dead period,\nscheduled from June 25-July 9 and that has raised a lot of questions.\n\n\"I don't think it's feasible to start, stop and start again,\" KHSAA\nCommissioner Julian Tackett said.\n\nMany of those questions have been formed through family vacations and what\nhappens as those have been planned for months around the dead period.\n\nTackett reiterated that everything through July 14 shall be considered\nvoluntary.\n\nFrom the KHSAA:\n\nAll involvement by students is voluntary without repercussion for failure to\nattend.\n\np No activity can be a condition for inclusion on a future roster.\n\np Competition or simulated competition cannot be conducted.\n\np All activity may not simulate game competition, including variations in the\nnumber of players per side.\n\np Sessions must focus on skill development and general conditioning as well as\ninstruction without game formations.\n\nWith that in mind, what do coaches now do with their planning without a dead\nperiod?\n\nFor cross country coaches Tim Pennington and Larry Garner, not much will\nchange.\n\n\"We always have voluntary practice in June and shut it down during dead\nperiod,\" said Garner, the boys' and girls' coach at Meade County. \"If we are\nallowed in Meade, I would continue to have those voluntary practices during\nthe dead period.\"\n\nThe Green Wave are coming off their first region team championship since 1980.\n\n\"Like many, I was listening to the KHSAA Board of Control meeting (Thursday)\nvia their YouTube broadcast so it was quite interesting listening to\neveryone,\" said Pennington, Central Hardin boys' coach and, like Garner, boys'\nand girls' track and field head coach. \"I can appreciate that some of the\nBoard of Control members were torn on where to go with their vote as it is an\nunprecedented time in our lives and this disease is still amongst us.\n\n\"Out of all the fall sports we probably have it the easiest at this time\nperiod. With that being said, we typically do not physically meet with\nathletes until the regular dead period would end in July. We have always had\nmeetings with our athletes and prospective athletes right before the end of\nthe school year and provided a guideline on training guidance.\"\n\nWhile all of this is still fluid, as they say, Pennington has plans in place\ngoing forward.\n\n\"We will not meet with athletes in person until probably July 13 and this is\nstill voluntary,\" he said. \"We plan to follow all protocols that are pertinent\nat that time. We will be utilizing social media of East Hardin, West Hardin\nand Central to get word out about our program and what's needed before the\nfirst in-person practice.\n\n\"Plans for this year will be to have more communications with athletes and\nparents via platforms like Zoom to discuss how to train. Many questions remain\non how our season will look, but the most important thing is we do everything\npossible to keep our athletes and their families safe as we all navigate\nthrough this new way forward.\"\n\nGolf never shut down in Kentucky and limitations of the sport never really\nhappened. While golfers and courses had to make modifications, a shutdown\nwasn't in the cards.\n\nIn theory, golfers should be further ahead of this time last year.\n\nVolleyball, football and soccer aren't supposed to share the ball under\nguidelines, which makes things different as teams ease back into athletics.\n\n\"There's still so many questions I have regarding this unusual preseason,\"\nNorth Hardin second-year volleyball coach Amanda Patterson said. \"We'd\nnormally be in the gym every single weekday up until dead period, having open\ngyms and workouts, but obviously all of that has been put on hold. However,\nwith there now being no dead period, I think that's where we start just\ngetting back into the swing of things - I hope.\n\n\"Whether we are only allowed to hold workouts, or finally get our hands on a\nvolleyball, most of our time is going to be about building relationships and\nbuilding our bodies back up to be on the court again. All of our athletes just\nhad to stop any type of training with club teams or spring sports, and I'm\nmost concerned with just getting them moving. It is my hope that we can start\nup with a volleyball as soon as we're allowed back in the gym, but that may\nnot be the case so it may just be a lot of footwork and movement drills and\ngetting back into playing shape.\n\n\"We will use any time we have this summer getting as many touches as we're\nallowed. That is my hope. It is my hope that the gym can feel like a safe and\n'normal' place for the girls again - just getting to be surrounded by their\nteammates playing the game they all love.\"\n\nThe most complicated of the fall sports is football with 11 moving parts on\neach snap of the ball.\n\n\"Considering all the guidelines we will have to follow, I am not sure what\nexactly we can get done,\" Central Hardin coach Tim Mattingly said. \"We will\nhave to be smart when it comes to getting our team back in shape and ready to\npractice. I plan on using this (dead period) time to reconnect with our\nplayers and coaches. Overall, I am happy that we are getting a chance to get\nback together and be a team.\"\n\nCoaches will do different things based upon where the program is.\n\nFor John Hardin first-year coach Doug Preston, who came over from a successful\nstint at Franklin-Simpson, the lack of hands-on involvement the past two-plus\nmonths wasn't very helpful for getting to know his players and coming together\nas a coaching staff.\n\n\"We will use the days,\" Preston said of the dead period. \"Obviously with being\nthe new head football coach at John Hardin, I need time to catch up and get\nthe basics started. I'm not quite sure yet how we will structure things.\nThat's something we are going to be working on over the next two weeks.\"\n\nFort Knox third-year coach Wes Arnold sees the next six weeks, for lack of a\nbetter term, business as usual.\n\n\"With our transient school population, we do not do a whole lot in June\nusually anyways with so many kids moving, going on block leave, and many go\nspend time in another state visiting another parent or family,\" He said. \"As\nfar as the dead period goes, I was surprised they removed it this year. I\ncommunicated with my players if you have plans don't worry about it - go have\nfun with your family and I will see you when you get back. We will have to\nwait for guidance from our district and DoDEA.\n\n\"Being a federal school, our school-level decisions have to go way up the\nchain of command often. It's not as simple as a local board of education or\nlocal superintendent making a call like it is everywhere else. I am not sure\nwhen we will begin workouts, but if we get clearance we probably won't start\nuntil the June 29 or maybe not until after the 4th of July. A lot of questions\nhave to be answered first before we start getting back to it.\"\n\nLaRue County coach Josh Jaggers usually spends the dead period on the lake.\n\nHe is also waiting for some answers.\n\n\"Small groups lifting two-to-three times a week will probably be what we do,\"\nhe said. \"Other states around us are opening up, some with regulations, we\nhave no choice but to. Until I know for sure whether or not we're playing ...\n\n\"We haven't had set workouts schedules here since I've been back (in second\nstint as head coach) once school was out through the dead period.\n\n\"We are either playing or we aren't. If we are, we'll put the pedal down and\nlet's go. When we can? Just let me know.\"",

    "html": "<p>The door has opened for the return of high school sports.</p>\n<p>Just not all at once and not all with the same regulations.</p>\n\n<p>The sports have been broken into four groups:</p>\n\n<p>Low-touch indoor: Archery, bowling, Esports, swimming and diving.</p>\n\n<p>Low-touch outdoor: Baseball, bass fishing, cross country, golf, softball, tennis, track and field.</p>\n\n<p>High-touch indoor: Basketball, competitive cheer, dance, volleyball, wrestling</p>\n\n<p>High-touch outdoor: Field hockey, football, soccer.</p>\n\n<p>Coaches can meet with players on campuses beginning Monday with groups of 10 people or less and safety guidelines must be followed.</p>\n\n<p>There will be no practices in any sport from Monday through <chron>June 14</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>High-touch sports can begin workouts and exercises in small groups effective <chron>June 15</chron>, but practices will not be allowed until <chron>June 29</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Cross country can begin practices <chron>June 15</chron> with competition being allowed June 29.</p>\n\n<p>The KHSAA Board of Control voted 13-5 Thursday to eliminate the dead period, scheduled from <chron>June 25-July 9</chron> and that has raised a lot of questions.</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think it's feasible to start, stop and start again,\" KHSAA Commissioner <person>Julian Tackett</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>Many of those questions have been formed through family vacations and what happens as those have been planned for months around the dead period.</p>\n\n<p>Tackett reiterated that everything through <chron>July 14</chron> shall be considered voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>From the KHSAA:</p>\n\n<p>All involvement by students is voluntary without repercussion for failure to attend.</p>\n\n<p>p No activity can be a condition for inclusion on a future roster.</p>\n\n<p>p Competition or simulated competition cannot be conducted.</p>\n\n<p>p All activity may not simulate game competition, including variations in the number of players per side.</p>\n\n<p>p Sessions must focus on skill development and general conditioning as well as instruction without game formations.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, what do coaches now do with their planning without a dead period?</p>\n\n<p>For cross country coaches <person>Tim Pennington</person> and <person>Larry Garner</person>, not much will change.</p>\n\n<p>\"We always have voluntary practice in June and shut it down during dead period,\" said Garner, the boys' and girls' coach at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.meade\">Meade County</location>. \"If we are allowed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.meade\">Meade</location>, I would continue to have those voluntary practices during the dead period.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Green Wave are coming off their first region team championship since 1980.</p>\n\n<p>\"Like many, I was listening to the KHSAA Board of Control meeting (Thursday) via their YouTube broadcast so it was quite interesting listening to everyone,\" said Pennington, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.hardin\">Central Hardin</location> boys' coach and, like Garner, boys' and girls' track and field head coach. \"I can appreciate that some of the <org>Board of Control</org> members were torn on where to go with their vote as it is an unprecedented time in our lives and this disease is still amongst us.</p>\n\n<p>\"Out of all the fall sports we probably have it the easiest at this time period. With that being said, we typically do not physically meet with athletes until the regular dead period would end in July. We have always had meetings with our athletes and prospective athletes right before the end of the school year and provided a guideline on training guidance.\"</p>\n\n<p>While all of this is still fluid, as they say, Pennington has plans in place going forward.</p>\n\n<p>\"We will not meet with athletes in person until probably <chron>July 13</chron> and this is still voluntary,\" he said. \"We plan to follow all protocols that are pertinent at that time. We will be utilizing social media of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.hardin\">East Hardin</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.hardin\">West Hardin</location> and Central to get word out about our program and what's needed before the first in-person practice.</p>\n\n<p>\"Plans for this year will be to have more communications with athletes and parents via platforms like Zoom to discuss how to train. Many questions remain on how our season will look, but the most important thing is we do everything possible to keep our athletes and their families safe as we all navigate through this new way forward.\"</p>\n\n<p>Golf never shut down in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Kentucky</location> and limitations of the sport never really happened. While golfers and courses had to make modifications, a shutdown wasn't in the cards.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, golfers should be further ahead of this time last year.</p>\n\n<p>Volleyball, football and soccer aren't supposed to share the ball under guidelines, which makes things different as teams ease back into athletics.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's still so many questions I have regarding this unusual preseason,\" <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.hardin\">North Hardin</location> second-year volleyball coach <person>Amanda Patterson</person> said. \"We'd normally be in the gym every single weekday up until dead period, having open gyms and workouts, but obviously all of that has been put on hold. However, with there now being no dead period, I think that's where we start just getting back into the swing of things - I hope.</p>\n\n<p>\"Whether we are only allowed to hold workouts, or finally get our hands on a volleyball, most of our time is going to be about building relationships and building our bodies back up to be on the court again. All of our athletes just had to stop any type of training with club teams or spring sports, and I'm most concerned with just getting them moving. It is my hope that we can start up with a volleyball as soon as we're allowed back in the gym, but that may not be the case so it may just be a lot of footwork and movement drills and getting back into playing shape.</p>\n\n<p>\"We will use any time we have this summer getting as many touches as we're allowed. That is my hope. It is my hope that the gym can feel like a safe and 'normal' place for the girls again - just getting to be surrounded by their teammates playing the game they all love.\"</p>\n\n<p>The most complicated of the fall sports is football with 11 moving parts on each snap of the ball.</p>\n\n<p>\"Considering all the guidelines we will have to follow, I am not sure what exactly we can get done,\" Central Hardin coach <person>Tim Mattingly</person> said. \"We will have to be smart when it comes to getting our team back in shape and ready to practice. I plan on using this (dead period) time to reconnect with our players and coaches. Overall, I am happy that we are getting a chance to get back together and be a team.\"</p>\n\n<p>Coaches will do different things based upon where the program is.</p>\n\n<p>For <person>John Hardin</person> first-year coach <person>Doug Preston</person>, who came over from a successful stint at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.fralin\">Franklin</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.simson\">Simpson</location>, the lack of hands-on involvement the past two-plus months wasn't very helpful for getting to know his players and coming together as a coaching staff.</p>\n\n<p>\"We will use the days,\" Preston said of the dead period. \"Obviously with being the new head football coach at John Hardin, I need time to catch up and get the basics started. I'm not quite sure yet how we will structure things. That's something we are going to be working on over the next two weeks.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.fornox\">Fort Knox</location> third-year coach <person>Wes Arnold</person> sees the next six weeks, for lack of a better term, business as usual.</p>\n\n<p>\"With our transient school population, we do not do a whole lot in June usually anyways with so many kids moving, going on block leave, and many go spend time in another state visiting another parent or family,\" He said. \"As far as the dead period goes, I was surprised they removed it this year. I communicated with my players if you have plans don't worry about it - go have fun with your family and I will see you when you get back. We will have to wait for guidance from our district and DoDEA.</p>\n\n<p>\"Being a federal school, our school-level decisions have to go way up the chain of command often. It's not as simple as a local board of education or local superintendent making a call like it is everywhere else. I am not sure when we will begin workouts, but if we get clearance we probably won't start until the <chron>June 29</chron> or maybe not until after the 4th of July. A lot of questions have to be answered first before we start getting back to it.\"</p>\n\n<p>LaRue County coach <person>Josh Jaggers</person> usually spends the dead period on the lake.</p>\n\n<p>He is also waiting for some answers.</p>\n\n<p>\"Small groups lifting two-to-three times a week will probably be what we do,\" he said. \"Other states around us are opening up, some with regulations, we have no choice but to. Until I know for sure whether or not we're playing ...</p>\n\n<p>\"We haven't had set workouts schedules here since I've been back (in second stint as head coach) once school was out through the dead period.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are either playing or we aren't. If we are, we'll put the pedal down and let's go. When we can? Just let me know.\"</p>",
