For defined benefit plans, plans' claims on employers equals the\n    difference between actuarial liabilities and financial assets held by\n    plans. When actuarial liabilities exceed plan assets, imputed interest\n    is positive; when plan assets exceed actuarial liabilities, imputed\n    interest is negative.\n    (4.) Excludes implied funding of benefits from holding gains on assets\n    and excludes effects on change in the estimated value of benefit\n    entitlements that come from differences between actual experience and\n    previous actuarial assumptions, changes in actuarial assumptions, and\n    changes in plan provisions.\n    (5.) Consists of implied funding of benefits from holding gains on\n    assets for defined benefit pension plans (table 7.21, line 30) and\n    holding gains and other changes in assets for defined contribution\n    pension plans (table 7.25, line 30).\n    (6.) For defined benefit plans, excludes effects on change in the\n    estimated value of benefit entitlements that come from differences\n    between actual experience and previous actuarial assumptions, changes\n    in actuarial assumptions,and changes in plan provisions.\n    Note. In the NIPAs, pension plans are treated as 'pass-through'\n    institutions that hold financial assets on behalf of households, which\n    are the effective owners. Pension plans are classified as financial\n    corporations that receive contributions and property income on behalf\n    of plan participants but do not have saving or net worth of their own.\n    Tables 7.21, 7.22, 7.23, 7.24, and 7.25 show the transactions of the\n    private and government defined-benefit pension subsectors.",

Included in personal consumption expenditures as part of financial\nservices furnished without payment.\n(2.) Imputed income payments received by persons from the pension plans\n(line 18) are reinvested as household pension contribution supplements.\n(3.) For defined benefit plans, plans' claims on employers equals the\ndifference between actuarial liabilities and financial assets held by\nplans. When actuarial liabilities exceed plan assets, imputed interest\nis positive; when plan assets exceed actuarial liabilities, imputed\ninterest is negative.\n(4.) Excludes implied funding of benefits from holding gains on assets\nand excludes effects on change in the estimated value of benefit\nentitlements that come from differences between actual experience and\nprevious actuarial assumptions, changes in actuarial assumptions, and\nchanges in plan provisions.\n(5.) Consists of implied funding of benefits from holding gains on\nassets for defined benefit pension plans (table 7.21, line 30) and\nholding gains and other changes in assets for defined contribution\npension plans (table 7.25, line 30).\n(6.) For defined benefit plans, excludes effects on change in the\nestimated value of benefit entitlements that come from differences\nbetween actual experience and previous actuarial assumptions, changes\nin actuarial assumptions,and changes in plan provisions.\nNote. In the NIPAs, pension plans are treated as 'pass-through'\ninstitutions that hold financial assets on behalf of households, which\nare the effective owners. Pension plans are classified as financial\ncorporations that receive contributions and property income on behalf\nof plan participants but do not have saving or net worth of their own.\nTables 7.21, 7.22, 7.23, 7.24, and 7.25 show the transactions of the\nprivate and government defined-benefit pension subsectors.</pre>",
