Privacy Act\n\nIn accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the public to\nbetter inform its rulemaking process. DOT posts these comments, without edit,\nincluding any personal information the commenter provides, to\n[www.regulations.gov](http://www.regulations.gov), as described in the system\nof records notice (DOT/ALL-14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at\n[www.transportation.gov/privacy](http://www.transportation.gov/privacy).\n\nII. Background\n\nUnder 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), FMCSA may grant an exemption from the\nFMCSRs for no longer than a 5-year period if it finds such exemption would\nlikely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the\nlevel that would be achieved absent such exemption. The statute also allows\nthe Agency to renew exemptions at the end of the 5-year period. FMCSA grants\nmedical exemptions from the FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align with the\nmaximum duration of a driver's medical certification.\n\nThe physical qualification standard for drivers regarding epilepsy found in 49\nCFR 391.41(b)(8) states that a person is physically qualified to drive a CMV\nif that person has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of\nepilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause the loss of\nconsciousness or any loss of ability to control a CMV.\n\nIn addition to the regulations, FMCSA has published advisory criteria /1/ to\nassist medical examiners (MEs) in determining whether drivers with certain\nmedical conditions are qualified to operate a CMV in interstate commerce.\n\nFOOTNOTE 1 These criteria may be found in APPENDIX A TO PART 391--MEDICAL\nADVISORY CRITERIA, section H. Epilepsy: SEC 391.41(b)(8), paragraphs 3, 4, and\n5, which is available on the internet at\n<https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol5/pdf/CFR-2015-title49-vol5-part391-appA.pdf>.\nEND FOOTNOTE\n\nThe three individuals listed in this notice have requested renewal of their\nexemptions from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in SEC\n391.41(b)(8), in accordance with FMCSA procedures. Accordingly, FMCSA has\nevaluated these applications for renewal on their merits and decided to extend\neach exemption for a renewable 2-year period.\n\nIII. Request for Comments\n\nInterested parties or organizations possessing information that would\notherwise show that any, or all, of these drivers are not currently achieving\nthe statutory level of safety should immediately notify FMCSA. The Agency will\nevaluate any adverse evidence submitted and, if safety is being compromised or\nif continuation of the exemption would not be consistent with the goals and\nobjectives of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), FMCSA will take immediate steps\nto revoke the exemption of a driver.\n\nIV. Basis for Renewing Exemptions\n\nIn accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), each of the three\napplicants has satisfied the renewal conditions for obtaining an exemption\nfrom the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition. The three drivers in this\nnotice remain in good standing with the Agency, have maintained their medical\nmonitoring and have not exhibited any medical issues that would compromise\ntheir ability to safely operate a CMV during the previous 2-year exemption\nperiod. In addition, for Commercial Driver's License (CDL) holders, the\nCommercial Driver's License Information System and the Motor Carrier\nManagement Information System are searched for crash and violation data. For\nnon-CDL holders, the Agency reviews the driving records from the State\nDriver's Licensing Agency. These factors provide an adequate basis for\npredicting each driver's ability to continue to safely operate a CMV in\ninterstate commerce. Therefore, FMCSA concludes that extending the exemption\nfor each renewal applicant for a period of 2 years is likely to achieve a\nlevel of safety equal to that existing without the exemption.\n\nIn accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), the following groups of\ndrivers received renewed exemptions in the month of July and are discussed\nbelow.\n\nAs of July 1, 2020, and in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b),\nthe following two individuals have satisfied the renewal conditions for\nobtaining an exemption from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in\nthe FMCSRs for interstate CMV drivers:\n\nJesse Hansen (MN) and Nicholas Ramirez (AL)\n\nThe drivers were included in docket number FMCSA-2018-0052. Their exemptions\nare applicable as of July 1, 2020, and will expire on July 1, 2022.\n\nAs of July 14, 2020, and in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b),\nthe following individual has satisfied the renewal conditions for obtaining an\nexemption from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in the FMCSRs\nfor interstate CMV drivers:\n\nRonald Blount (GA)\n\nThe driver was included in docket number FMCSA-2013-0445. His exemption is\napplicable as of July 14, 2020, and will expire on July 14, 2022.\n\nV. Conditions and Requirements\n\nThe exemptions are extended subject to the following conditions: (1) Each\ndriver must remain seizure-free and maintain a stable treatment during the\n2-year exemption period; (2) each driver must submit annual reports from their\ntreating physicians attesting to the stability of treatment and that the\ndriver has remained seizure-free; (3) each driver must undergo an annual\nmedical examination by a certified ME, as defined by SEC 390.5; and (4) each\ndriver must provide a copy of the annual medical certification to the employer\nfor retention in the driver's qualification file, or keep a copy of his/her\ndriver's qualification file if he/she is self-employed. The driver must also\nhave a copy of the exemption when driving, for presentation to a duly\nauthorized Federal, State, or local enforcement official. The exemption will\nbe rescinded if: (1) The person fails to comply with the terms and conditions\nof the exemption; (2) the exemption has resulted in a lower level of safety\nthan was maintained before it was granted; or (3) continuation of the\nexemption would not be consistent with the goals and objectives of 49 U.S.C.\n31136(e) and 31315(b).\n\nVI. Preemption\n\nDuring the period the exemption is in effect, no State shall enforce any law\nor regulation that conflicts with this exemption with respect to a person\noperating under the exemption.\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\nBased on its evaluation of the three exemption applications, FMCSA renews the\nexemptions of the aforementioned drivers from the epilepsy and seizure\ndisorders prohibition in SEC 391.41(b)(8). In accordance with 49 U.S.C.\n31136(e) and 31315(b), each exemption will be valid for 2 years unless revoked\nearlier by FMCSA.\n\nLarry W.

Background</p>\n<p>Under 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), FMCSA may grant an exemption from the FMCSRs for no longer than a 5-year period if it finds such exemption would likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption. The statute also allows the Agency to renew exemptions at the end of the 5-year period. FMCSA grants medical exemptions from the FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align with the maximum duration of a driver's medical certification.</p>\n<p>The physical qualification standard for drivers regarding epilepsy found in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(8) states that a person is physically qualified to drive a CMV if that person has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause the loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a CMV.</p>\n<p>In addition to the regulations, FMCSA has published advisory criteria /1/ to assist medical examiners (MEs) in determining whether drivers with certain medical conditions are qualified to operate a CMV in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;FOOTNOTE 1 These criteria may be found in APPENDIX A TO PART 391--MEDICAL ADVISORY CRITERIA, section H. Epilepsy: <org>SEC</org> 391.41(b)(8), paragraphs 3, 4, and 5, which is available on the internet at <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol5/pdf/CFR-2015-title49-vol5-part391-appA.pdf\">https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title49-vol5/pdf/CFR-2015-title49-vol5-part391-appA.pdf</a>. END FOOTNOTE</p>\n<p>The three individuals listed in this notice have requested renewal of their exemptions from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in <org>SEC</org> 391.41(b)(8), in accordance with FMCSA procedures. Accordingly, FMCSA has evaluated these applications for renewal on their merits and decided to extend each exemption for a renewable 2-year period.</p>\n<p>III. Request for Comments</p>\n<p>Interested parties or organizations possessing information that would otherwise show that any, or all, of these drivers are not currently achieving the statutory level of safety should immediately notify FMCSA. The Agency will evaluate any adverse evidence submitted and, if safety is being compromised or if continuation of the exemption would not be consistent with the goals and objectives of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), FMCSA will take immediate steps to revoke the exemption of a driver.</p>\n<p>IV. Basis for Renewing Exemptions</p>\n<p>In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), each of the three applicants has satisfied the renewal conditions for obtaining an exemption from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition. The three drivers in this notice remain in good standing with the Agency, have maintained their medical monitoring and have not exhibited any medical issues that would compromise their ability to safely operate a CMV during the previous 2-year exemption period. In addition, for Commercial Driver's License (CDL) holders, the Commercial Driver's License Information System and the Motor Carrier Management Information System are searched for crash and violation data. For non-CDL holders, the Agency reviews the driving records from the State Driver's <org>Licensing Agency</org>. These factors provide an adequate basis for predicting each driver's ability to continue to safely operate a CMV in interstate commerce. Therefore, FMCSA concludes that extending the exemption for each renewal applicant for a period of 2 years is likely to achieve a level of safety equal to that existing without the exemption.</p>\n<p>In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), the following groups of drivers received renewed exemptions in the month of July and are discussed below.</p>\n<p>As of <chron>July 1, 2020</chron>, and in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), the following two individuals have satisfied the renewal conditions for obtaining an exemption from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in the FMCSRs for interstate CMV drivers:</p>\n<p><person>Jesse Hansen</person> (MN) and <person>Nicholas Ramirez</person> (AL)</p>\n<p>The drivers were included in docket number FMCSA-2018-0052. Their exemptions are applicable as of <chron>July 1, 2020</chron>, and will expire on <chron>July 1, 2022</chron>.</p>\n<p>As of <chron>July 14, 2020</chron>, and in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), the following individual has satisfied the renewal conditions for obtaining an exemption from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in the FMCSRs for interstate CMV drivers:</p>\n<p><person>Ronald Blount</person> (GA)</p>\n<p>The driver was included in docket number FMCSA-2013-0445. His exemption is applicable as of <chron>July 14, 2020</chron>, and will expire on <chron>July 14, 2022</chron>.</p>\n<p>V. Conditions and Requirements</p>\n<p>The exemptions are extended subject to the following conditions: (1) Each driver must remain seizure-free and maintain a stable treatment during the 2-year exemption period; (2) each driver must submit annual reports from their treating physicians attesting to the stability of treatment and that the driver has remained seizure-free; (3) each driver must undergo an annual medical examination by a certified ME, as defined by <org>SEC</org> 390.5; and (4) each driver must provide a copy of the annual medical certification to the employer for retention in the driver's qualification file, or keep a copy of his/her driver's qualification file if he/she is self-employed. The driver must also have a copy of the exemption when driving, for presentation to a duly authorized Federal, State, or local enforcement official. The exemption will be rescinded if: (1) The person fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the exemption; (2) the exemption has resulted in a lower level of safety than was maintained before it was granted; or (3) continuation of the exemption would not be consistent with the goals and objectives of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b).</p>\n<p>VI. Preemption</p>\n<p>During the period the exemption is in effect, no State shall enforce any law or regulation that conflicts with this exemption with respect to a person operating under the exemption.</p>\n<p>VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p>Based on its evaluation of the three exemption applications, FMCSA renews the exemptions of the aforementioned drivers from the epilepsy and seizure disorders prohibition in <org>SEC</org> 391.41(b)(8). In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), each exemption will be valid for 2 years unless revoked earlier by FMCSA.</p>\n<p><person>Larry W.
