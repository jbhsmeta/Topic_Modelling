    "text": "IT is more than 13 years since three-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished from\nthe Portuguese coastal village of Praia da Luz while on holiday with her\nparents Kate and Gerry and siblings.\n\n2007 ? May 3: Kate and Gerry McCann from Rothley, Leicestershire, leave their\nthree children asleep in their holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in southern\nPortugal while they dine with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant.\n\nNothing is amiss when Mr McCann checks on the youngsters just after 9pm, but\nwhen his wife goes back at about 10pm she finds three-year-old Madeleine\nmissing.\n\nJane Tanner, one of the friends dining with the McCanns, reports seeing a man\ncarrying a child earlier that night.\n\n? May 14: Detectives take Anglo-Portuguese property developer Robert Murat in\nfor questioning and make him an \"arguido\", or formal suspect.\n\n? August 11: Exactly 100 days after Madeleine disappeared investigating\nofficers publicly acknowledge for the first time that she could be dead.\n\n? September 7: During questioning of Mr and Mrs McCann detectives make them\nboth \"arguidos\".\n\n? September 9: The McCanns fly back to England with their twoyear-old twins\nSean and Amelie.\n\n2008 ? July 21: The Portuguese authorities shelve their investigation and lift\nthe \"arguido\" status of the McCanns and Robert Murat.\n\n2011 ? May 12: Scotland Yard launches a review of the case.\n\n2012 ? April 25: Scotland Yard detectives say they believe Madeleine could\nstill be alive, and call on the Portuguese authorities to reopen the case, but\nPortuguese police say they have found no new material.\n\n2013 ? July 4: Scotland Yard confirms it has launched its own investigation,\nOperation Grange, into Madeleine's disappearance two years into a review of\nthe case. ? October 24: Portuguese police confirm that a review of their\noriginal investigation has uncovered new lines of inquiry, and reopen the\ncase.\n\n2014 ? January 29: British detectives fly to Portugal amid claims they are\nplanning to make arrests. ? June 3: Sniffer dogs and specialist teams are used\nto search an area of scrubland close to where Madeleine went missing.\n\n2015 ? September 16: The Government discloses the investigation has cost more\nthan \u00a310m.\n\n? October 28: Scotland Yard's investigation is cut from 29 officers to four.\n\n2017 ? April 30: The couple prepare to mark 10 years since their daughter's\ndisappearance with a BBC interview, where they vow to do \"whatever it takes\nfor as long as it takes\" to find her.\n\n2019 ? May 3: Local media report Portuguese detectives are investigating a\nforeign paedophile as a suspect in the abduction.\n\n2020 ? June 3: Police reveal that a 43-year-old German prisoner has been\nidentified as a suspect in Madeleine's disappearance. ? June 4: German\nprosecutors reveal they believe Madeleine is dead and are investigating the\nsuspect on suspicion of her murder.\n\nScotland Yard's Operation Grange, which had received \u00a312.3m in funding up to\nApril this year, is still a missing person inquiry as detectives have no\n\"definitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead\".",
