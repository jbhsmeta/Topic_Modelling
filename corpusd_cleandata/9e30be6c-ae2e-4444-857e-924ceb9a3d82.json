    "text": "More than 100 people turned out Sunday afternoon for an quickly-organized\nmarch through Uptown Roxboro to protest the killing of George Floyd in\nMinneapolis and to prove that Roxboro residents can protest injustice without\nresorting to the kinds of violence other cities have seen.\n\nRoxboro resident Luther Perkins was in Raleigh Saturday night and saw the\ndestruction that took place after peaceful protests turned violent. He came\nhome determined to keep that kind of violence from happening here.\n\n\"I want people to understand that their voices can be heard without the kinds\nof things we've been seeing happen in other places,\" Perkins said before\nSunday's rally. \"We can get together peacefully \u0096 all of us \u0096 and work toward\nthe kind of positive change we want.\"\n\nPerkins announced plans for the rally on Facebook and word spread throughout\nthe community during the day on Sunday.\n\nThe Roxboro Police Department asked permission to participate and Mayor\nMerilyn Newell asked Perkins if the city's elected leaders could participate.\nBoth groups were represented Sunday afternoon, along with members of BASIC \u0096\nBrothers and Sisters In Conversation \u0096 and the Person County Board of\nEducation.\n\nBut most of the crowd were ordinary citizens who turned out for the rally to\nprotest what some called \"systemic racism and white privilege.\"\n\nIn remarks to the crowd before the march, Perkins said Roxboro residents have\na chance to \"show that we are more than people think we are.\"\n\nHe said violence helps nothing.\n\n\"You can look at the places where there has been violence and see the hole\nthey have dug for themselves,\" Perkins said.\n\nRoxboro Chief of Police David Hess deplored Floyd's killing at the hands of a\nMinneapolis police officer. The confrontation was caught on videotape and that\nofficer has now been charged with third-degree murder.\n\n\"George Floyd's life mattered. What condemn what happened. We condemn this\nofficer and the actions he took in Minneapolis. We will not accept that kind\nof behavior by any member of the Roxboro Police Department,\" Hess said.\n\nHe encouraged the peaceful nature of Sunday's protest. \"That's why we want to\nwalk with you today,\" Hess said.\n\nRev. Larry McDonald, pastor of Allen's Chapel Church, also expressed a desire\nto see controversial issues like racism addressed peacefully. McDonald went to\ncollege with George Floyd's aunt and uncle. He said he spoke with them\nThursday night and they were urging communities not to engage in the kinds of\nviolent protests which were beginning to flare up.\n\nNewell, Roxboro's mayor, said peaceful marches like Sunday's event create a\nblueprint for how communities can work out differences.\n\n\"Peace and justice are the only logical conclusions,\" Newell said.",

    "title": "Peaceful Roxboro march protests Floyd killing",
    "html": "<p>More than 100 people turned out Sunday afternoon for an quickly-organized march through Uptown Roxboro to protest the killing of <person>George Floyd</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> and to prove that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.roxoro\">Roxboro</location> residents can protest injustice without resorting to the kinds of violence other cities have seen.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.roxoro\">Roxboro</location> resident <person>Luther Perkins</person> was in <person>Raleigh Saturday</person> night and saw the destruction that took place after peaceful protests turned violent. He came home determined to keep that kind of violence from happening here.</p>\n\n<p>\"I want people to understand that their voices can be heard without the kinds of things we've been seeing happen in other places,\" Perkins said before Sunday's rally. \"We can get together peacefully &#150; all of us &#150; and work toward the kind of positive change we want.\"</p>\n\n<p>Perkins announced plans for the rally on Facebook and word spread throughout the community during the day on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Roxboro Police Department</org> asked permission to participate and Mayor <person>Merilyn Newell</person> asked Perkins if the city's elected leaders could participate. Both groups were represented Sunday afternoon, along with members of BASIC &#150; Brothers and Sisters In Conversation &#150; and the <org>Person County Board of Education</org>.</p>\n\n<p>But most of the crowd were ordinary citizens who turned out for the rally to protest what some called \"systemic racism and white privilege.\"</p>\n\n<p>In remarks to the crowd before the march, Perkins said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.roxoro\">Roxboro</location> residents have a chance to \"show that we are more than people think we are.\"</p>\n\n<p>He said violence helps nothing.</p>\n\n<p>\"You can look at the places where there has been violence and see the hole they have dug for themselves,\" Perkins said.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.roxoro\">Roxboro</location> Chief of Police <person>David Hess</person> deplored Floyd's killing at the hands of a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer. The confrontation was caught on videotape and that officer has now been charged with third-degree murder.</p>\n\n<p>\"<person>George Floyd's</person> life mattered. What condemn what happened. We condemn this officer and the actions he took in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location>. We will not accept that kind of behavior by any member of the <org>Roxboro Police Department</org>,\" Hess said.</p>\n\n<p>He encouraged the peaceful nature of Sunday's protest. \"That's why we want to walk with you today,\" Hess said.</p>\n\n<p>Rev. <person>Larry McDonald</person>, pastor of Allen's <org>Chapel Church</org>, also expressed a desire to see controversial issues like racism addressed peacefully. McDonald went to college with <person>George Floyd's</person> aunt and uncle. He said he spoke with them Thursday night and they were urging communities not to engage in the kinds of violent protests which were beginning to flare up.</p>\n\n<p>Newell, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.roxoro\">Roxboro's</location> mayor, said peaceful marches like Sunday's event create a blueprint for how communities can work out differences.</p>\n\n<p>\"Peace and justice are the only logical conclusions,\" Newell said.</p>",
