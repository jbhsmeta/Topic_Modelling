    "text": "Pasquotank County plans to award Elizabeth City roughly a quarter of the\nnearly $900,000 it's receiving from the federal government's $2 trillion-plus\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act passed by Congress in\nMarch.\n\nPasquotank is receiving $897,950 in CARES Act funding from the General\nAssembly as part of the $1.7 billion coronavirus stimulus measure approved by\nstate lawmakers earlier this month. The state of North Carolina received a\ntotal of $3.5 billion in CARES Act funding.\n\nThe stimulus measure includes a provision requiring distribution of $150\nmillion to local governments across the state, and Pasquotank's allotment\ncomes from that.\n\nBesides awarding the city $250,000 of that stimulus funding, the county also\nplans to spend $250,000 on a Small Business Grant Program for small businesses\nin Pasquotank and another $200,000 in \"hazard pay\" for county public safety\nemployees.\n\nOther CARES Act monies will be used to reimburse Pasquotank-Camden Emergency\nMedical Services for $50,000 in employee overtime incurred because of the\npandemic. The funding will also reimburse the county for the $75,000 it spent\non personal protection equipment and sanitization and disinfectant supplies.\n\nElizabeth City-Pasquotank Public Schools will also receive around $50,000 for\ntechnology needs associated with its implementation of distance learning.\nECPPS began offering remote instruction in mid-March after the governor closed\nschool buildings because of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nHammett told commissioners that county governments across the state have the\noption to allocate COVID-19 relief funds to cities and towns in their\ncounties. If funds are shared the county can choose its own allocation method,\nhe said.\n\n\"The intent of this was to allocate some funding (to cities and towns),\"\nHammett said. \"The reason why the funds went to counties and not cities is\nbecause in a public health crisis more of the burden of a public health crisis\nis at the county level. It's EMS, it's emergency management, it's the public\nhealth department.''\n\nCity Manager Rich Olson said the city will use $190,000 of its total\nallocation from the county for hazard pay for public safety employees. The\ncity previously awarded 24 hours of additional vacation time to all city\nemployees working during the pandemic.\n\nThe most recent federal guidelines governing CARES Act funds, however, states\nthat hazard pay can only be given to public safety employees, meaning those\nwho work for police or fire departments.\n\nThe city can use the remaining funds for reimbursement for eligible\nexpenditures such as PPE purchased during the pandemic. The city will send\ndocumentation of expenses to the county for reimbursement.\n\nCounty public safety employees will receive a one-time bonus of 24 hours of\nCOVID-19 hazard pay under the plan. Other county employees working during the\npandemic may receive an additional 24 hours of leave time.\n\n\"This (hazard pay) is very prevalent out in the private and public sector,\"\nHammett said. \"COVID-19 has been very scary and to actually to come in and do\nyour job, our employees have been incredible.\"\n\nCommissioner Charles Jordan said county employees deserve the benefit.\n\n\"They have worked very hard under some risky conditions,\" Jordan said. \"They\nhave been out there doing what is needed. It is a real risk for them, and a\nrisk for their families.\"",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.pasank\">Pasquotank County</location> plans to award <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.eliity\">Elizabeth City</location> roughly a quarter of the nearly <money>$900,000</money> it's receiving from the federal government's <money>$2 trillion</money>-plus Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act passed by <org>Congress</org> in March.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.pasank\">Pasquotank</location> is receiving <money>$897,950</money> in CARES Act funding from the <org>General Assembly</org> as part of the <money>$1.7 billion</money> coronavirus stimulus measure approved by state lawmakers earlier this month. The state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location> received a total of <money>$3.5 billion</money> in CARES Act funding.</p>\n\n<p>The stimulus measure includes a provision requiring distribution of <money>$150 million</money> to local governments across the state, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.pasank\">Pasquotank's</location> allotment comes from that.</p>\n\n<p>Besides awarding the city <money>$250,000</money> of that stimulus funding, the county also plans to spend <money>$250,000</money> on a Small Business Grant Program for small businesses in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.pasank\">Pasquotank</location> and another <money>$200,000</money> in \"hazard pay\" for county public safety employees.</p>\n\n<p>Other CARES Act monies will be used to reimburse <org>Pasquotank-Camden Emergency Medical Services</org> for <money>$50,000</money> in employee overtime incurred because of the pandemic. The funding will also reimburse the county for the <money>$75,000</money> it spent on personal protection equipment and sanitization and disinfectant supplies.</p>\n\n<p><org>Elizabeth City-Pasquotank Public Schools</org> will also receive around <money>$50,000</money> for technology needs associated with its implementation of distance learning. ECPPS began offering remote instruction in mid-March after the governor closed school buildings because of the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>\n\n<p>Hammett told commissioners that county governments across the state have the option to allocate COVID-19 relief funds to cities and towns in their counties. If funds are shared the county can choose its own allocation method, he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"The intent of this was to allocate some funding (to cities and towns),\" Hammett said. \"The reason why the funds went to counties and not cities is because in a public health crisis more of the burden of a public health crisis is at the county level. It's EMS, it's emergency management, it's the public health department.''</p>\n\n<p>City Manager <person>Rich Olson</person> said the city will use <money>$190,000</money> of its total allocation from the county for hazard pay for public safety employees. The city previously awarded 24 hours of additional vacation time to all city employees working during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>The most recent federal guidelines governing CARES Act funds, however, states that hazard pay can only be given to public safety employees, meaning those who work for police or fire departments.</p>\n\n<p>The city can use the remaining funds for reimbursement for eligible expenditures such as PPE purchased during the pandemic. The city will send documentation of expenses to the county for reimbursement.</p>\n\n<p>County public safety employees will receive a one-time bonus of 24 hours of COVID-19 hazard pay under the plan. Other county employees working during the pandemic may receive an additional 24 hours of leave time.</p>\n\n<p>\"This (hazard pay) is very prevalent out in the private and public sector,\" Hammett said. \"COVID-19 has been very scary and to actually to come in and do your job, our employees have been incredible.\"</p>\n\n<p>Commissioner <person>Charles Jordan</person> said county employees deserve the benefit.</p>\n\n<p>\"They have worked very hard under some risky conditions,\" Jordan said. \"They have been out there doing what is needed. It is a real risk for them, and a risk for their families.\"</p>",
