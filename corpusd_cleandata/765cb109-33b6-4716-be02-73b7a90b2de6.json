    "text": "President Donald Trump's announcement that his administration will designate\nAntifa as a terrorist organization is surely unconstitutional because it would\neffectively criminalize joining an American domestic ideological group.\n\nThanks to the First Amendment, the U.S. government has historically avoided\ndesignating domestic groups on both the left and right as terrorist. Belonging\nto such groups is consistent with the legitimate exercise of your First\nAmendment right to freedom of speech and belief - whether you are a white\nsupremacist or an environmental activist.\n\nOf course, should an American citizen commit a crime in service of her\nextremist beliefs she can be prosecuted for that crime, but she can't be\nprosecuted for merely belonging to the group, no matter how objectionable its\nviews might be.\n\nThe situation is quite different when it comes to terrorist groups based\noverseas. If you look at the National Counterterrorism Center's list of\ndesignated terrorist groups, you will see that all the groups that are listed\nare based outside the United States. Joining such designated Foreign Terrorist\nOrganizations is not protected by the First Amendment and is prosecuted as a\ncrime.\n\nIf Trump succeeds in designating Antifa it potentially opens the door for\nAmerican citizens to be charged for merely holding their beliefs - even if\nthey are extreme and at times militant.\n\nIt also begs the question why analogous extremist right-wing groups are not\nsimilarly designated by the Trump administration, since violent right-wing\nextremists in the U.S. kill far more Americans than leftist terrorists.\nAccording to data gathered by New America, a research institution, since 9/11\nright-wing terrorists in the United States have killed 110 people for\npolitical reasons, while Antifa supporters have killed exactly no one for\npolitical reasons. Meanwhile, those motivated by Black nationalist ideology\nhave killed 12 people.\n\nIn other words, the threat posed by lethal right-wing terrorists since the\n9/11 attacks is almost 10 times greater than that posed by leftist terrorists.\n\nTo its credit, the Trump administration designated the Russian Imperial\nMovement, a white supremacist group based in Russia, as a terrorist\norganization in April. Yet there is no indication that the Trump\nadministration will effectively criminalize being a member of an American\nright-wing extremist group. And for good reason: The First Amendment is the\nfirst for a reason, and it allows Americans to hold extremist beliefs of all\nflavors without fear of prosecution - including Antifa supporters.",

    "html": "<p>President <person>Donald Trump's</person> announcement that his administration will designate Antifa as a terrorist organization is surely unconstitutional because it would effectively criminalize joining an American domestic ideological group.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the First Amendment, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> government has historically avoided designating domestic groups on both the left and right as terrorist. Belonging to such groups is consistent with the legitimate exercise of your First Amendment right to freedom of speech and belief - whether you are a white supremacist or an environmental activist.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, should an American citizen commit a crime in service of her extremist beliefs she can be prosecuted for that crime, but she can't be prosecuted for merely belonging to the group, no matter how objectionable its views might be.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is quite different when it comes to terrorist groups based overseas. If you look at the National Counterterrorism Center's list of designated terrorist groups, you will see that all the groups that are listed are based outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Joining such designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations is not protected by the First Amendment and is prosecuted as a crime.</p>\n\n<p>If Trump succeeds in designating Antifa it potentially opens the door for American citizens to be charged for merely holding their beliefs - even if they are extreme and at times militant.</p>\n\n<p>It also begs the question why analogous extremist right-wing groups are not similarly designated by the Trump administration, since violent right-wing extremists in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> kill far more Americans than leftist terrorists. According to data gathered by New America, a research institution, since 9/11 right-wing terrorists in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> have killed 110 people for political reasons, while Antifa supporters have killed exactly no one for political reasons. Meanwhile, those motivated by Black nationalist ideology have killed 12 people.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the threat posed by lethal right-wing terrorists since the 9/11 attacks is almost 10 times greater than that posed by leftist terrorists.</p>\n\n<p>To its credit, the Trump administration designated the <org>Russian Imperial Movement</org>, a white supremacist group based in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location>, as a terrorist organization in April. Yet there is no indication that the Trump administration will effectively criminalize being a member of an American right-wing extremist group. And for good reason: The First Amendment is the first for a reason, and it allows Americans to hold extremist beliefs of all flavors without fear of prosecution - including Antifa supporters.</p>",
