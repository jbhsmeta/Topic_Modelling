    "text": "Ina Cramer of Sherrill celebrated her 100th birthday May 21, but she might not\nhave made it if her doctor was right about her chances after a heart attack.\nShe was given only 10 years to live by her surgeon at the time.\n\nThat was nearly 50 years ago.\n\nA more recent visit with a much younger doctor brought amazement as he saw\njust how much she had survived in her life. She joked and asked him who was\nthumbing their nose now, as three of her former surgeons had predeceased her.\nThat young doctor told Ina in beating those odds she had taught him not to\nassume what he knew from a textbook to be absolute ever again.\n\nJoined by son Mark Cramer and daughter-in-law Carol Cramer, Ina recently\nshared her stories and the secret of her longevity from her Noyes Manor home.\nHer 100th birthday was celebrated there in style with a gala parade of well-\nwishers riding through the parking lot as she sat with friends outside, with\nthe festively-decorated vehicles of family and friends joined with Sherrill\npolice cars and firetrucks.\n\nThere was even an official proclamation from Sherrill mayor Bill Vineall\ndesignating May 21, 2020 as \"Ina Cramer Day\" in the Silver City.\n\nBorn Ina Blodgett, her birthdays growing up were always a special time,\nespecially when she lived on Cazenovia Lake during the days of her youth.\nThen, she and her sister Roberta celebrated the occasion with an annual swim\nacross the length of the lake, with one of them in a rowboat and the other\nswimming alongside. After the trip they switched positions so the other could\nalso enjoy a brisk swim.\n\nThat ritual happened every year regardless of the weather and some of those\nlake outings in mid-May were quite cold, Ina remembered.\n\nHer father worked as a caretaker for the wealthy Fairchild family. Ina and her\nown family lived at the Fairchild's big home on the lake, so although Ina\ndidn't come from a rich family herself she was surrounded by finery. Ina said\nshe really appreciated all the Fairchilds did for her own family, calling them\n\"wonderful\" people.\n\nIna recalled the days in her Cazenovia hometown when she could walk to school\nor to the dress shop or grocery store right downtown on Albany Street. Now,\nmuch of the shopping is done out of town, she noted.\n\nShe married her husband DeForest Cramer in 1942. During World War II, DeForest\njoined the service and Ina worked as a civilian on a naval base in Florida.\nAfter the war, the couple lived in Morrisville where Ina worked as the\nsuperintendent's administrative assistant in the Morrisville-Eaton Central\nSchool district.\n\nIna and DeForest moved to Ransom Avenue in Sherrill in 1993. DeForest passed\naway on his 80th birthday in 2002 and she relocated just a few blocks over to\nNoyes Manor in 2007.\n\nThe couple had two sons and daughters-in-law, Mark and Carol and Jack and his\nwife Pat. There are Mark and Carol's kids Andrew and his wife Katie, Audra and\nher boyfriend Tom and Caira and her husband Mike; Jack and Pat's kids Amy and\nher husband Raj and Meegan and her husband Joe; and great-grandchildren\nCadence, Cruz, Karina, Lance, Lily, Levi, Luke and Ravi.\n\nOne of her biggest joys in life has always been visits with her children,\ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\n\"I've always had family around me,\" Ina said.\n\nMark admitted his days as a child himself were sometimes spent hiding from his\nmother, although she was simply trying to do what was best for him. He\nrecalled whenever he got a scrap, Mom was quick to grab her healing \u0096 but\nstinging \u0096 bottle of iodine.\n\n\"It got to the point where I would try to hide my injuries to avoid the pain\nof the iodine,\" he remembered.\n\nHis parents also used to flood their backyard during the chill of winter to\ncreate an ice skating rink, Mark added.\n\nIna said one of the technological advances that impressed her the most in her\nlifetime was the introduction of color television. She was also quite amazed\nonly two years ago to watch Audra's college commencement streamed from\nScotland, as she viewed it from Mark and Carol's own Sherrill home.\n\nMark said Ina was always very disciplined and did whatever her doctor\nrecommended. She admitted she didn't really feel she had a \"secret\" to her\nlongevity \u0096 she just always took every day as it came and welcomed each one.\n\nWhen asked for her advice for the young people of today, Ina encouraged them\nall to take everything that comes at them in stride.\n\n\"You have to just accept it,\" she explained. \"If you don't accept it you will\nbe left along the wayside. Nobody ever left me along the wayside.\"\n\nDeForest worked as a \"scout\" for antiques dealers and Ina took a liking to the\nold-time items as well. Carol said their own home boasts many quality antique\npieces thanks to the expert eye of her in-laws.\n\nMark joked that her interest in antiquities has taken on an even bigger\nimportance in his mother's life.\n\n\"Now we are telling her that she has become an antique herself,\" he said.\n\nTo see a video from the birthday parade, find the Mid-York Weekly on Facebook.",

    "html": "<p><person>Ina Cramer</person> of Sherrill celebrated her 100th birthday <chron>May 21</chron>, but she might not have made it if her doctor was right about her chances after a heart attack. She was given only 10 years to live by her surgeon at the time.</p>\n<p>That was nearly 50 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>A more recent visit with a much younger doctor brought amazement as he saw just how much she had survived in her life. She joked and asked him who was thumbing their nose now, as three of her former surgeons had predeceased her. That young doctor told Ina in beating those odds she had taught him not to assume what he knew from a textbook to be absolute ever again.</p>\n\n<p>Joined by son <person>Mark Cramer</person> and daughter-in-law <person>Carol Cramer</person>, Ina recently shared her stories and the secret of her longevity from her <location>Noyes Manor</location> home. Her 100th birthday was celebrated there in style with a gala parade of well-wishers riding through the parking lot as she sat with friends outside, with the festively-decorated vehicles of family and friends joined with Sherrill police cars and firetrucks.</p>\n\n<p>There was even an official proclamation from Sherrill mayor <person>Bill Vineall</person> designating <chron>May 21, 2020</chron> as \"<person>Ina Cramer Day</person>\" in the Silver City.</p>\n\n<p>Born <person>Ina Blodgett</person>, her birthdays growing up were always a special time, especially when she lived on <location>Cazenovia Lake</location> during the days of her youth. Then, she and her sister Roberta celebrated the occasion with an annual swim across the length of the lake, with one of them in a rowboat and the other swimming alongside. After the trip they switched positions so the other could also enjoy a brisk swim.</p>\n\n<p>That ritual happened every year regardless of the weather and some of those lake outings in mid-May were quite cold, Ina remembered.</p>\n\n<p>Her father worked as a caretaker for the wealthy Fairchild family. Ina and her own family lived at the Fairchild's big home on the lake, so although Ina didn't come from a rich family herself she was surrounded by finery. Ina said she really appreciated all the Fairchilds did for her own family, calling them \"wonderful\" people.</p>\n\n<p>Ina recalled the days in her Cazenovia hometown when she could walk to school or to the dress shop or grocery store right downtown on <location>Albany Street</location>. Now, much of the shopping is done out of town, she noted.</p>\n\n<p>She married her husband <person>DeForest Cramer</person> in 1942. During World War II, DeForest joined the service and Ina worked as a civilian on a naval base in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>. After the war, the couple lived in Morrisville where Ina worked as the superintendent's administrative assistant in the <org>Morrisville-Eaton Central School</org> district.</p>\n\n<p>Ina and DeForest moved to <location>Ransom Avenue</location> in Sherrill in 1993. DeForest passed away on his 80th birthday in 2002 and she relocated just a few blocks over to <location>Noyes Manor</location> in 2007.</p>\n\n<p>The couple had two sons and daughters-in-law, Mark and Carol and Jack and his wife Pat. There are Mark and Carol's kids Andrew and his wife Katie, Audra and her boyfriend Tom and Caira and her husband Mike; Jack and Pat's kids Amy and her husband Raj and Meegan and her husband Joe; and great-grandchildren Cadence, Cruz, Karina, Lance, Lily, Levi, Luke and Ravi.</p>\n\n<p>One of her biggest joys in life has always been visits with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>\n\n<p>\"I've always had family around me,\" Ina said.</p>\n\n<p>Mark admitted his days as a child himself were sometimes spent hiding from his mother, although she was simply trying to do what was best for him. He recalled whenever he got a scrap, Mom was quick to grab her healing &#150; but stinging &#150; bottle of iodine.</p>\n\n<p>\"It got to the point where I would try to hide my injuries to avoid the pain of the iodine,\" he remembered.</p>\n\n<p>His parents also used to flood their backyard during the chill of winter to create an ice skating rink, Mark added.</p>\n\n<p>Ina said one of the technological advances that impressed her the most in her lifetime was the introduction of color television. She was also quite amazed only two years ago to watch Audra's college commencement streamed from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/gb.sco\">Scotland</location>, as she viewed it from Mark and Carol's own Sherrill home.</p>\n\n<p>Mark said Ina was always very disciplined and did whatever her doctor recommended. She admitted she didn't really feel she had a \"secret\" to her longevity &#150; she just always took every day as it came and welcomed each one.</p>\n\n<p>When asked for her advice for the young people of today, Ina encouraged them all to take everything that comes at them in stride.</p>\n\n<p>\"You have to just accept it,\" she explained. \"If you don't accept it you will be left along the wayside. Nobody ever left me along the wayside.\"</p>\n\n<p>DeForest worked as a \"scout\" for antiques dealers and Ina took a liking to the old-time items as well. Carol said their own home boasts many quality antique pieces thanks to the expert eye of her in-laws.</p>\n\n<p>Mark joked that her interest in antiquities has taken on an even bigger importance in his mother's life.</p>\n\n<p>\"Now we are telling her that she has become an antique herself,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>To see a video from the birthday parade, find the <org>Mid-York Weekly</org> on Facebook.</p>",
