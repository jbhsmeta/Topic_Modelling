    "text": "WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - With protests throughout the country, President Donald\nTrump is holding the anti-fascist group Antifa responsible and wants to\nofficially designate them a terrorist organization.\n\nPeople have been protesting across America following the death of George\nFloyd, a black man who died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on\nhis neck for more than eight minutes. That officer has been charged with\nthird-degree murder.\n\n\"They're indiscriminate, their violent destruction deprives lawful citizens of\ntheir right to really get the issues addressed,\" Pennsylvania Rep. Fred Keller\n(R-PA) said.\n\nKeller says he doesn't want bad actors to distract from the message of the\nprotests.\n\n\"In this case, there are some people that really need to be brought to justice\nand that's the police officers who were involved in this horrendous incident\nwith Mr. Floyd,\" Keller said.\n\nMeanwhile, some Democrats believe the president is distracting the American\npublic from the real problem.\n\n\"The issue isn't what these protestors are doing or who's generating these\nprotests so much, it is racism in America. 400 years later, we're still\ndealing with it. It's time to fix the problem,\" Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin\n(VA-04) said.\n\nMcEachin says the violence seen in Virginia is a result of racism reaching a\nbreaking point. He says a declaring Antifa a terrorist organization won't help\nthe country.\n\n\"The best thing the president can do is go sit in a corner and be quiet\nbecause the things that he's doing is really quite frankly inflaming the\nsituation. He's not helping anything, he's not healing anything,\" McEachin\nsaid.\n\nMcEachin says Americans need to stay focused on the reason for the protests or\nelse the country will stay divided and no progress will be made.\n\n\\------------\n\nLatest Posts:\n\n* Kansas City restaurant faces backlash after police officer told not to wear uniform inside\n\n* GUC's annual temporary conversion to chlorine\n\n* 'Good character unity march' held in Gates County\n\n* Donnie Harris -Live at Whirligig Stage\n\n* The East's Daily Download, Friday June 12th",

It's time to fix the problem,\" Virginia Rep. <person>Donald McEachin</person> (<org>VA</org>-04) said.</p>\n\n<p>McEachin says the violence seen in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> is a result of racism reaching a breaking point. He says a declaring Antifa a terrorist organization won't help the country.</p>\n\n<p>\"The best thing the president can do is go sit in a corner and be quiet because the things that he's doing is really quite frankly inflaming the situation. He's not helping anything, he's not healing anything,\" McEachin said.</p>\n\n<p>McEachin says Americans need to stay focused on the reason for the protests or else the country will stay divided and no progress will be made.</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p>Latest Posts:</p>\n\n<p>* <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mo.kancty\">Kansas City</location> restaurant faces backlash after police officer told not to wear uniform inside</p>\n\n<p>* GUC's annual temporary conversion to chlorine</p>\n\n<p>* 'Good character unity march' held in Gates County</p>\n\n<p>* <person>Donnie Harris</person> -Live at Whirligig Stage</p>\n\n<p>* The East's Daily Download, <chron>Friday June 12th</chron></p>",
