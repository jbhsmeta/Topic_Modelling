    "text": "Change, realization, uplift, expression. Ideas now coursing through this\nmoment of history as people protest racism are the same as those that inspired\nthe project DJ Johnson is creating in the Marigny.\n\nThis black entrepreneur's vision is a convergence of art, literature and civic\ninteraction, balanced by a nice cocktail or two.\n\nRight now, in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, he's fighting to keep that\nvision alive with an unscripted assist from boiled shrimp, garlicky grilled\noysters and go-cup frose.\n\nLast summer, Johnson bought a cluster of buildings at Elysian Fields and St.\nClaude avenues that were formerly home to Gene's Po-Boys, Ilys Bistro and\nGene's Curbside Daiquiris.\n\nHe opened the art gallery and lounge NOLA Art Bar in the former Ilys spot.\nNext door, the art deco building that was previously the daiquiri shop will\nbecome a bookstore and coffee shop called Baldwin & Co., named for the\nAfrican-American writer and activist.\n\nThey share a blueprint that's designed to convene people and intended to\nstretch the time they spend together into new understandings.\n\n\"The social, racial, economic problems you're seeing now, we need to engage in\nconversations about this, and this would be a place for people to do that,\"\nsaid Johnson.\n\n\"I envisioned this as a place where people come to discuss the city's biggest\nissues and the world's biggest issues. It all starts with thought-provoking\nconversations. We have to talk about these issues, and we need different\nspaces for that to happen.\"\n\nHe got a taste of that potential when NOLA Art Bar opened in February, just a\nmonth before the pandemic response hit pause on the type of gatherings the\ngallery was built around. To keep the business going, Johnson has turned to\nfood.\n\nWhile the gallery itself remains closed, it has morphed for the moment into a\ntakeout restaurant, serving plates for curbside pickup or to eat in its open-\nair patio.\n\nThe daily menu is short and changeable, with mainstays of boiled shrimp and\nbarbecue shrimp, snow crab legs, chargrilled oysters, fish tacos (on Tuesdays,\nnaturally) and wings on Wednesdays. He's also been collaborating with others\nfor pop-ups, including an edition of recording artist Dawn Richard's vegan\nfood and art pop-up Papa Ted's. The gallery bar keeps the drinks flowing to\ngo.\n\nTo Johnson's surprise, the change has caught on, gained regulars and kept his\nstaff working for months now.\n\n\"I never thought we'd be known for food, but I had to look at what I could do\nto sustain and stay afloat through this,\" said Johnson.\n\nLocal roots, new vision\n\nNOLA Art Bar is a clean-lined modern space, with white walls on which to show\nart, contemporary furniture to hang back and relax, and a gleaming bar to\nserve up drinks. The courtyard, newly planted with citrus and set with sofas\nand tables (now spaced for social distancing) is an unexpected oasis in back.\nThe old pink-painted po-boy shop next door is dormant as Johnson explores new\nideas for the space.\n\nIt's a complete flip from what once held down this corner, and it goes way\nbeyond changed aesthetics.\n\nJohnson, 39, grew up nearby on Painters Street in the 8th Ward, the middle\nchild in a family of seven kids. He went on to become an information\ntechnology professional in Atlanta.\n\nHe surprised many last year when he bought the properties at Elysian Fields\nand St. Claude. Speculation swirled that they would become condos.\n\nBut Johnson is not a developer, not in the conventional sense. He saw the\nproperties as a way to create a multi-faceted project to bring something new\nto his hometown.\n\n\"I love this city, I walked these streets, it contributed so much to who I\nam,\" Johnson said. \"This is an opportunity to show the best of the things that\nI care about.\"\n\nHe conceived NOLA Art Bar as a showcase for street art, the work that speaks\nto him but does not always find a place in traditional galleries. The first\nexhibition, still on the walls from its short-lived debut in February, is work\nby Jay McKay, a New Orleans artist known for his murals.\n\n\"Go to Julia Street and the French Quarter. The galleries are beautiful, but\nyou don't see the street artists represented there, and I think these are the\nartists that really reflect the culture of New Orleans the most,\" he said.\n\nNOLA Art Bar was designed as a space to give these artists their due, and\ncreate a setting where people drawn to their work can spend time together.\n\n\"That's where conversations can happen, that's where connections can be built.\nThe main purpose here is to encourage conversation,\" Johnson said.\n\nBaldwin & Co., the bookstore and cafe, is intended to create multiple access\npoints for that goal.\n\n\"The vision is you can have coffee and pastry in the morning over there and\ntapas and Sazeracs here at night and the conversation keeps flowing,\" Johnson\nsaid.\n\nBaldwin & Co. will be a hub for literacy programs, book clubs and other\noutreach efforts.\n\n\"I grew up in a community that didn't read and didn't see the value in books,\"\nsaid Johnson. \"But what's so encouraging to me now is seeing the difference it\nmakes when you get young black kids really interested in reading. It inspires\nsuch creativity.\"\n\nBaldwin & Co. should open in the months ahead, as renovations progress and\ncoronavirus guidelines allow.\n\nFood was an unforeseen addition to the project, but one that has become a\nbridge from NOLA Art Bar's promising start to what Johnson hopes will be its\nfuture. He compares the moves to tactics on the basketball court.\n\n\"Some players can overpower anyone on the court and get to the goal, but Covid\nis something you can't overpower,\" he said. \"So you look at players who are\ngreat at the counter. If you cut me off from the goal, I'm going to juke, pass\nfrom behind - I'm going to pivot and get there.\"\n\nNOLA Art Bar\n\n2128 St. Claude Ave., (504) 708-4804\n\nDaily 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. for curbside pickup and takeout (outdoor seating\navailable)",

    "title": "NOLA Art Bar, built for issues New Orleans is confronting now, pivots to food to carry on",
    "html": "<p>Change, realization, uplift, expression. Ideas now coursing through this moment of history as people protest racism are the same as those that inspired the project DJ Johnson is creating in the Marigny.</p>\n<p>This black entrepreneur's vision is a convergence of art, literature and civic interaction, balanced by a nice cocktail or two.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, he's fighting to keep that vision alive with an unscripted assist from boiled shrimp, garlicky grilled oysters and go-cup fr&#243;se.</p>\n\n<p>Last summer, Johnson bought a cluster of buildings at Elysian Fields and St. Claude avenues that were formerly home to Gene's Po-Boys, Ilys Bistro and Gene's Curbside Daiquiris.</p>\n\n<p>He opened the art gallery and lounge NOLA Art Bar in the former Ilys spot. Next door, the art deco building that was previously the daiquiri shop will become a bookstore and coffee shop called <org>Baldwin &amp; Co.</org>, named for the <org>African-American</org> writer and activist.</p>\n\n<p>They share a blueprint that's designed to convene people and intended to stretch the time they spend together into new understandings.</p>\n\n<p>\"The social, racial, economic problems you're seeing now, we need to engage in conversations about this, and this would be a place for people to do that,\" said Johnson.</p>\n\n<p>\"I envisioned this as a place where people come to discuss the city's biggest issues and the world's biggest issues. It all starts with thought-provoking conversations. We have to talk about these issues, and we need different spaces for that to happen.\"</p>\n\n<p>He got a taste of that potential when NOLA Art Bar opened in February, just a month before the pandemic response hit pause on the type of gatherings the gallery was built around. To keep the business going, Johnson has turned to food.</p>\n\n<p>While the gallery itself remains closed, it has morphed for the moment into a takeout restaurant, serving plates for curbside pickup or to eat in its open-air patio.</p>\n\n<p>The daily menu is short and changeable, with mainstays of boiled shrimp and barbecue shrimp, snow crab legs, chargrilled oysters, fish tacos (on Tuesdays, naturally) and wings on Wednesdays. He's also been collaborating with others for pop-ups, including an edition of recording artist <person>Dawn Richard's</person> vegan food and art pop-up Papa Ted's. The gallery bar keeps the drinks flowing to go.</p>\n\n<p>To Johnson's surprise, the change has caught on, gained regulars and kept his staff working for months now.</p>\n\n<p>\"I never thought we'd be known for food, but I had to look at what I could do to sustain and stay afloat through this,\" said Johnson.</p>\n\n<p>Local roots, new vision</p>\n\n<p>NOLA Art Bar is a clean-lined modern space, with white walls on which to show art, contemporary furniture to hang back and relax, and a gleaming bar to serve up drinks. The courtyard, newly planted with citrus and set with sofas and tables (now spaced for social distancing) is an unexpected oasis in back. The old pink-painted po-boy shop next door is dormant as Johnson explores new ideas for the space.</p>\n\n<p>It's a complete flip from what once held down this corner, and it goes way beyond changed aesthetics.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson, 39, grew up nearby on <location>Painters Street</location> in the <location>8th Ward</location>, the middle child in a family of seven kids. He went on to become an information technology professional in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">Atlanta</location>.</p>\n\n<p>He surprised many last year when he bought the properties at Elysian Fields and <person>St. Claude</person>. Speculation swirled that they would become condos.</p>\n\n<p>But Johnson is not a developer, not in the conventional sense. He saw the properties as a way to create a multi-faceted project to bring something new to his hometown.</p>\n\n<p>\"I love this city, I walked these streets, it contributed so much to who I am,\" Johnson said. \"This is an opportunity to show the best of the things that I care about.\"</p>\n\n<p>He conceived NOLA Art Bar as a showcase for street art, the work that speaks to him but does not always find a place in traditional galleries. The first exhibition, still on the walls from its short-lived debut in February, is work by <person>Jay McKay</person>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> artist known for his murals.</p>\n\n<p>\"Go to <location>Julia Street</location> and the <location>French Quarter</location>. The galleries are beautiful, but you don't see the street artists represented there, and I think these are the artists that really reflect the culture of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> the most,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>NOLA Art Bar was designed as a space to give these artists their due, and create a setting where people drawn to their work can spend time together.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's where conversations can happen, that's where connections can be built. The main purpose here is to encourage conversation,\" Johnson said.</p>\n\n<p><org>Baldwin &amp; Co.</org>, the bookstore and caf&#233;, is intended to create multiple access points for that goal.</p>\n\n<p>\"The vision is you can have coffee and pastry in the morning over there and tapas and Sazeracs here at night and the conversation keeps flowing,\" Johnson said.</p>\n\n<p><org>Baldwin &amp; Co.</org> will be a hub for literacy programs, book clubs and other outreach efforts.</p>\n\n<p>\"I grew up in a community that didn't read and didn't see the value in books,\" said Johnson. \"But what's so encouraging to me now is seeing the difference it makes when you get young black kids really interested in reading. It inspires such creativity.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>Baldwin &amp; Co.</org> should open in the months ahead, as renovations progress and coronavirus guidelines allow.</p>\n\n<p>Food was an unforeseen addition to the project, but one that has become a bridge from NOLA Art Bar's promising start to what Johnson hopes will be its future. He compares the moves to tactics on the basketball court.</p>\n\n<p>\"Some players can overpower anyone on the court and get to the goal, but Covid is something you can't overpower,\" he said. \"So you look at players who are great at the counter. If you cut me off from the goal, I'm going to juke, pass from behind - I'm going to pivot and get there.\"</p>\n\n<p>NOLA Art Bar</p>\n\n<p><location>2128 St. Claude Ave.</location>, (504) 708-4804</p>\n\n<p>Daily <chron>2 p.m. to 8 p.m.</chron> for curbside pickup and takeout (outdoor seating available)</p>",
