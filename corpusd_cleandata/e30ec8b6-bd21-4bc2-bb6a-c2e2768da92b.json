    "text": "Elizabeth Bingham Marney died peacefully and unexpectedly at home on May 26,\n2020. Betty was born Elizabeth Ann Bingham to St. John Bingham and Annis\nMorison Bingham in Bristol, Tenn., on August 8, 1940. She spent part of her\nchildhood in Bristol. Although an only child, she adored trips to the lake and\na great deal of mischief with the cousins whom she considered sisters. She\nmoved to the Panama Canal Zone with her mother when she was 10. After her\nmother's death, Betty returned to Bristol to live with her grandmother\nElizabeth Turner Morison and graduated from Tennessee High School in 1958. She\ncompleted an AA degree at Sullins College before matriculating to the\nUniversity of North Carolina in Chapel Hill where she earned a BA and MA in\nEnglish, graduating Summa Cum Laude. She was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa\nSociety and was known to wear her PBK key in the same way Madeleine Albright\nwears brooches. If she had the key on, she was planning to win. After\ngraduating from UNC, she took a teaching position at Southern Methodist\nUniversity in 1963 where she worked with Laurence \"Larry\" Perrine, the author\nof Literature, Structure, Sound, and Sense: a title that will evoke memories\nfor all Harpeth Hall Students who crossed paths with Betty from 1975-1985. And\nalthough she did leave UNC physically, she remained a tried and true Tarheel\nfor life!!! After SMU, Betty attended the University of Texas at Austin where\nshe earned her PhD in English and wrote her dissertation on Saul Bellow. On\none of her trips back home to Bristol, Betty's grandmother set her up on a\nblind date with a promising young medical resident, albeit from the Va. side\nof Bristol, named Sam Marney. After the first date, Betty's Grandmother asked,\n\"Well, what did you talk about?' Betty said, \"Politics.\" Her grandmother\nreplied, \"Betty, you fool!\" After a brief a courtship, Sam proposed, and Betty\ntold him, \"Well, I'll think about it.\" She soon acquiesced and Betty and Sam\ncelebrated 53 years of marriage on October 1, 2019. Betty and Sam lived in\nNashville for most of their married life with the exception of a year in\nOxford, England, in 1967-68 where they made lifelong friends and delivered\ntheir son Sam. Their daughter Annis was born in Nashville in 1970 and the\nentire Marney clan went on a year-long adventure to California where Sam\nconducted research at Scripps in La Jolla. They returned to Nashville in 1974\nand stayed put. Betty embarked on a teaching career at Harpeth Hall School in\n1975, where for 10 years she earned a reputation as both inspiring and\nsometimes terrifying. Her love of English literature was contagious. She\nadored working with young women, and she helped establish some traditions that\nbecame lore, including dressing up with colleagues Dona Gower and Sarah Stamps\nas the Three Witches from Macbeth for Halloween. Although students sometimes\n(often) confessed to living in fear of Betty, she was also called by many\nstudents the best teacher they had ever encountered. Over their working lives,\nBetty and Sam and their children enjoyed being frequent guests of their dear\nfriends Dona and Herschel Gower, and their daughter Alison at Beersheba\nSprings, Tenn., where they hiked and swam and looked out on the valley from\nthe deck. The children learned a great deal about whether Billy Budd was a\ntravesty or a tragedy when the \"Big Dipper Poured.\" Dona and Betty disagreed,\namicably. On many Thanksgivings, Dona and others would cook, and Betty would\n\"supervise.\" Betty and Sam also enjoyed many weekends as guests on the other\nside of Monteagle Mountain with their dear friends David and Kay Hall at\nSewanee. Speed sitting on that deck was delightful. Being up on the cool\nplateau suited Betty's inner temperature (too hot). After leaving Harpeth Hall\nin 1985, Betty earned a law degree from Vanderbilt at the age of 48. She had\ncome from a line of attorneys, judges, and the occasional criminal and thrived\nin her second career as a lawyer. She began with first amendment work at King\nand Ballow before becoming in-house counsel at the Nashville Banner newspaper,\nand she was proud to have written the brief and been in attendance in one case\nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. She completed her legal career working in the\nCriminal Appellate Division of the Tennessee Attorney General's office where\nfriends may not be surprised to learn that she enjoyed being called \"General.\"\nUpon leaving her legal office at the state for the last time in 2008, and not\nbeing terribly sentimental, she had no desire to hang her law degree on her\nwall at home, so she put it in the trash. It was then collected by a colleague\nwho had always wanted a Vanderbilt law degree, and as far as we know it still\nhangs in someone's office in the Tennessee AG's office. Upon retirement in\n2008, Betty and Sam enjoyed several years of international travel. With the\nexception of Antarctica, they visited every continent, making friends and\nbuilding memories. You haven't really seen a picture of Betty until you've\nseen her riding a camel. She and Sam enjoyed their grandchildren, who called\nthem GrandBetty and GrandSam. She took great pride in her grandchildren's many\nand varied accomplishments. Being the consummate teacher, she also took every\nopportunity to teach them about whatever might interest them. She remained an\navid reader all her life, and sharing and talking about books was a favorite\npastime. After travel was no longer possible, she and Sam enjoyed a quiet\nroutine at home, reading the New Yorker weekly, the New York Times daily,\nstaying up to date on current politics, and worrying about the country going\nto hell in a handbasket. The past few years, Betty served as a steadfast and\nloving companion for her husband, Sam, who has suffered from various\nillnesses. Recently, she expressed profound gratitude for the many generous\nand kind caregivers who have helped her and Sam so they could stay in their\nhome in Green Hills, where they lived for over 50 years. She is survived by\nher husband, Samuel Rowe Marney Jr.; her son, Samuel Rowe Marney III of\nMemphis; his daughters, Dylan Elizabeth Marney and Quinn Alexis Marney; and\ntheir mother, Tara Gruet Marney; her daughter, Annis Morison Marney and her\nhusband, Glenn Gustus Dukes, Jr., and their children, Ian Marney Dukes and\nAnnis Kyle (AK) Morison Dukes; and her sister-in-law, Nancy Marney. A small,\nprivate funeral service was held at home on Saturday, May 30, 2020, with\nPastor Carol Cavin-Dillon of West End United Methodist Church. Carol once was\na student of Betty's, which would have pleased Betty enormously. Turns out\nCarol attended Duke University, but we still think very highly of her. The\nfamily hopes to host a celebration of Betty's life later this summer.

    "html": "<p><person>Elizabeth Bingham Marney</person> died peacefully and unexpectedly at home on <chron>May 26, 2020</chron>. Betty was born <person>Elizabeth Ann Bingham</person> to <person>St. John Bingham</person> and <person>Annis Morison Bingham</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.bristl\">Bristol, Tenn.</location>, on <chron>August 8, 1940</chron>. She spent part of her childhood in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.bristl\">Bristol</location>. Although an only child, she adored trips to the lake and a great deal of mischief with the cousins whom she considered sisters. She moved to the <location>Panama Canal Zone</location> with her mother when she was 10. After her mother's death, Betty returned to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.bristl\">Bristol</location> to live with her grandmother <person>Elizabeth Turner Morison</person> and graduated from <org>Tennessee High School</org> in 1958. She completed an AA degree at <org>Sullins College</org> before matriculating to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3698739372\">University of North Carolina</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.chaill\">Chapel Hill</location> where she earned a BA and MA in English, graduating Summa Cum Laude. She was a member of the <org>Phi Beta Kappa Society</org> and was known to wear her PBK key in the same way <person>Madeleine Albright</person> wears brooches. If she had the key on, she was planning to win. After graduating from UNC, she took a teaching position at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3958149487\">Southern Methodist University</org> in 1963 where she worked with <person>Laurence \"Larry\" Perrine</person>, the author of Literature, Structure, Sound, and Sense: a title that will evoke memories for all Harpeth Hall Students who crossed paths with Betty from 1975-1985. And although she did leave UNC physically, she remained a tried and true Tarheel for life!!! After <org>SMU</org>, Betty attended the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0333514001\">University of Texas at Austin</org> where she earned her PhD in English and wrote her dissertation on <person>Saul Bellow</person>. On one of her trips back home to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.bristl\">Bristol</location>, Betty's grandmother set her up on a blind date with a promising young medical resident, albeit from the Va. side of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.bristl\">Bristol</location>, named <person>Sam Marney</person>. After the first date, Betty's Grandmother asked, \"Well, what did you talk about?' Betty said, \"Politics.\" Her grandmother replied, \"Betty, you fool!\" After a brief a courtship, Sam proposed, and Betty told him, \"Well, I'll think about it.\" She soon acquiesced and Betty and Sam celebrated 53 years of marriage on <chron>October 1, 2019</chron>. Betty and Sam lived in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.nashvl\">Nashville</location> for most of their married life with the exception of a year in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.oxford\">Oxford, England</location>, in 1967-68 where they made lifelong friends and delivered their son Sam. Their daughter Annis was born in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.nashvl\">Nashville</location> in 1970 and the entire Marney clan went on a year-long adventure to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> where Sam conducted research at Scripps in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.lajlla\">La Jolla</location>. They returned to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.nashvl\">Nashville</location> in 1974 and stayed put. Betty embarked on a teaching career at <org>Harpeth Hall School</org> in 1975, where for 10 years she earned a reputation as both inspiring and sometimes terrifying. Her love of English literature was contagious. She adored working with young women, and she helped establish some traditions that became lore, including dressing up with colleagues <person>Dona Gower</person> and <person>Sarah Stamps</person> as the Three Witches from Macbeth for <chron>Halloween</chron>. Although students sometimes (often) confessed to living in fear of Betty, she was also called by many students the best teacher they had ever encountered. Over their working lives, Betty and Sam and their children enjoyed being frequent guests of their dear friends Dona and <person>Herschel Gower</person>, and their daughter Alison at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.beengs\">Beersheba Springs, Tenn.</location>, where they hiked and swam and looked out on the valley from the deck. The children learned a great deal about whether <person>Billy Budd</person> was a travesty or a tragedy when the \"Big Dipper Poured.\" Dona and Betty disagreed, amicably. On many Thanksgivings, Dona and others would cook, and Betty would \"supervise.\" Betty and Sam also enjoyed many weekends as guests on the other side of <location>Monteagle Mountain</location> with their dear friends David and <person>Kay Hall</person> at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.sewnee\">Sewanee</location>. Speed sitting on that deck was delightful. Being up on the cool plateau suited Betty's inner temperature (too hot). After leaving Harpeth Hall in 1985, Betty earned a law degree from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.vanilt\">Vanderbilt</location> at the age of 48. She had come from a line of attorneys, judges, and the occasional criminal and thrived in her second career as a lawyer. She began with first amendment work at King and Ballow before becoming in-house counsel at the Nashville Banner newspaper, and she was proud to have written the brief and been in attendance in one case before the <org>U.S. Supreme Court</org>. She completed her legal career working in the <org>Criminal Appellate Division of the Tennessee Attorney General's</org> office where friends may not be surprised to learn that she enjoyed being called \"General.\" Upon leaving her legal office at the state for the last time in 2008, and not being terribly sentimental, she had no desire to hang her law degree on her wall at home, so she put it in the trash. It was then collected by a colleague who had always wanted a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.vanilt\">Vanderbilt</location> law degree, and as far as we know it still hangs in someone's office in the <org>Tennessee AG's</org> office. Upon retirement in 2008, Betty and Sam enjoyed several years of international travel. With the exception of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/ant\">Antarctica</location>, they visited every continent, making friends and building memories. You haven't really seen a picture of Betty until you've seen her riding a camel. She and Sam enjoyed their grandchildren, who called them GrandBetty and GrandSam. She took great pride in her grandchildren's many and varied accomplishments. Being the consummate teacher, she also took every opportunity to teach them about whatever might interest them. She remained an avid reader all her life, and sharing and talking about books was a favorite pastime. After travel was no longer possible, she and Sam enjoyed a quiet routine at home, reading the <org>New Yorker</org> weekly, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:NYT\">the New York Times</org> daily, staying up to date on current politics, and worrying about the country going to hell in a handbasket. The past few years, Betty served as a steadfast and loving companion for her husband, Sam, who has suffered from various illnesses. Recently, she expressed profound gratitude for the many generous and kind caregivers who have helped her and Sam so they could stay in their home in <location>Green Hills</location>, where they lived for over 50 years. She is survived by her husband, <person>Samuel Rowe Marney Jr</person>.; her son, Samuel Rowe Marney III of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.memphi\">Memphis</location>; his daughters, <person>Dylan Elizabeth Marney</person> and <person>Quinn Alexis Marney</person>; and their mother, <person>Tara Gruet Marney</person>; her daughter, <person>Annis Morison Marney</person> and her husband, <person>Glenn Gustus Dukes</person>, Jr., and their children, <person>Ian Marney Dukes</person> and Annis Kyle (AK) Morison Dukes; and her sister-in-law, <person>Nancy Marney</person>. A small, private funeral service was held at home on <chron>Saturday, May 30, 2020</chron>, with Pastor <person>Carol Cavin-Dillon</person> of <org>West End United Methodist Church</org>. Carol once was a student of Betty's, which would have pleased Betty enormously. Turns out Carol attended <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0356235695\">Duke University</org>, but we still think very highly of her. The family hopes to host a celebration of Betty's life later this summer.
