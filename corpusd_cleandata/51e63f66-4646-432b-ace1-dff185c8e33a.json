    "text": "The government's hydrogen strategy was presented today by the Minister of\nPetroleum and Energy Tina Bru (H) and Minister of Climate and Environment\nSveinung Rotevatn (V).\n\nThe strategy, which is the first of its kind ever, will lay the foundation for\nthe government's further work on hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen is an energy carrier that can help reduce emissions and create value\nfor Norwegian business and industry. The Government wants to prioritize\nefforts in those areas where Norway has special advantages, where Norway and\nNorwegian companies and technology environments can influence development, and\nwhere there are opportunities for increased value creation and green growth.\n\nFor hydrogen to be a low- or emission-free energy carrier, it must be produced\nwith no or very low emissions, such as by electrolysis of clean power water,\nor from natural gas with CO 2 handling.\n\nTechnology maturity and high costs are currently key barriers to increased use\nof hydrogen, especially in the transport sector and as an input factor in\nparts of the industry. If hydrogen and hydrogen-based solutions such as green\nammonia are to be used in new areas, the technology and solutions must become\nmore mature. Further technology development is important.\n\nAn important goal for the government is to increase the number of pilot and\ndemonstration projects in Norway, by contributing to and supporting technology\ndevelopment and commercialization. There is a broad focus on zero-emission\ntechnologies and solutions throughout the instrument. In addition, there is a\nsignificant strengthened investment in hydrogen in Norway in the green\ntransition package presented by the government last week, says Oil and Energy\nMinister Tina Bru.\n\nOn May 29, the government proposed, among other things, to allocate NOK 120\nmillion to the ENERGIX program in the Research Council of Norway. Hydrogen-\nrelated technologists and solutions will play a central role in this effort.\n\nEmission-free transport and industry\n\nIn Norway today, the maritime sector, heavy transport and industrial processes\nstand out as the most relevant uses for hydrogen.\n\nThe government has a broad focus on zero-emission solutions in the transport\nsector throughout the policy instrument. The Research Council of Norway,\nInnovation Norway and Enova contribute to development and demonstration,\nincluding through joint calls in PILOT-E.\n\nThrough the Zero Emission Fund, Enova also contributes to early market\nintroduction of hydrogen solutions in commercial vehicles and vessels. Enova\nhas also been significantly strengthened as part of the green restructuring\npackage. This is to strengthen the focus on technology development in the\nindustry and contribute to green restructuring in line with the transition to\nthe low-emission society, including technology development in areas such as\nhydrogen.\n\nHydrogen will be an important contribution on the road towards the low-\nemission society, especially in transport and industry. We have strengthened\nseveral of the instruments that help to bring hydrogen solutions closer to the\nmarket , says Minister of Climate and Environment Sveinung Rotevatn.\n\nAs part of the green restructuring package, the Government is proposing to\nincrease funding for the speedboat initiative under the Climate Rate by NOK 20\nmillion. The scheme strengthens the counties' efforts to promote zero- and\nlow-emission speedboats, including hydrogen-powered boats.\n\nThe scheme supports, among other things, development contracts that could be\nimportant for creating good financial conditions in order for technology\nenvironments to compete to develop the best zero-emission solutions for\nselected fast boat connections.",

    "html": "<p>The government's hydrogen strategy was presented today by the Minister of Petroleum and Energy <person>Tina Bru</person> (H) and Minister of Climate and Environment Sveinung Rotevatn (V).</p>\n<p>The strategy, which is the first of its kind ever, will lay the foundation for the government's further work on hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen is an energy carrier that can help reduce emissions and create value for Norwegian business and industry. The Government wants to prioritize efforts in those areas where <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/no\">Norway</location> has special advantages, where <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/no\">Norway</location> and Norwegian companies and technology environments can influence development, and where there are opportunities for increased value creation and green growth.</p>\n<p>For hydrogen to be a low- or emission-free energy carrier, it must be produced with no or very low emissions, such as by electrolysis of clean power water, or from natural gas with CO 2 handling.</p>\n<p>Technology maturity and high costs are currently key barriers to increased use of hydrogen, especially in the transport sector and as an input factor in parts of the industry. If hydrogen and hydrogen-based solutions such as green ammonia are to be used in new areas, the technology and solutions must become more mature. Further technology development is important.</p>\n<p>An important goal for the government is to increase the number of pilot and demonstration projects in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/no\">Norway</location>, by contributing to and supporting technology development and commercialization. There is a broad focus on zero-emission technologies and solutions throughout the instrument. In addition, there is a significant strengthened investment in hydrogen in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/no\">Norway</location> in the green transition package presented by the government last week, says Oil and Energy Minister <person>Tina Bru</person>.</p>\n<p>On <chron>May 29</chron>, the government proposed, among other things, to allocate <money>NOK 120 million</money> to the ENERGIX program in the <org>Research Council of Norway</org>. Hydrogen-related technologists and solutions will play a central role in this effort.</p>\n<p>Emission-free transport and industry</p>\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/no\">Norway</location> today, the maritime sector, heavy transport and industrial processes stand out as the most relevant uses for hydrogen.</p>\n<p>The government has a broad focus on zero-emission solutions in the transport sector throughout the policy instrument. <org>The Research Council of Norway</org>, Innovation Norway and Enova contribute to development and demonstration, including through joint calls in PILOT-E.</p>\n<p>Through the <org>Zero Emission Fund</org>, Enova also contributes to early market introduction of hydrogen solutions in commercial vehicles and vessels. Enova has also been significantly strengthened as part of the green restructuring package. This is to strengthen the focus on technology development in the industry and contribute to green restructuring in line with the transition to the low-emission society, including technology development in areas such as hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Hydrogen will be an important contribution on the road towards the low-emission society, especially in transport and industry. We have strengthened several of the instruments that help to bring hydrogen solutions closer to the market , says Minister of Climate and Environment Sveinung Rotevatn.</p>\n<p>As part of the green restructuring package, the Government is proposing to increase funding for the speedboat initiative under the Climate Rate by <money>NOK 20 million</money>. The scheme strengthens the counties' efforts to promote zero- and low-emission speedboats, including hydrogen-powered boats.</p>\n<p>The scheme supports, among other things, development contracts that could be important for creating good financial conditions in order for technology environments to compete to develop the best zero-emission solutions for selected fast boat connections.</p>",
