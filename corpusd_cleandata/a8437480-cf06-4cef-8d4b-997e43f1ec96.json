    "text": "A YOUNGSTER has raised more than \u00a31,000 for a youth homeless charity by\nclimbing the highest hill in his hometown.\n\nTen-year-old Lincoln Ramsay, from Sunderland, has raised over a \u00a31,000 for\nCentrepoint by climbing Penshaw Hill 42 times.\n\nLincoln wanted to do a challenge to help homeless and vulnerable people, and\nsaid he would like to climb the highest mountain in the UK, Ben Nevis.\n\nHowever, due to Covid-19 lockdown, Lincoln and his dad Gary had to adapt and\ncome up with a local solution.\n\nMr Ramsay said: \"We worked out how many times we would have to travel up\nPenshaw Hill in Sunderland to make the equivalent height of Ben Nevis.\n\n\"It worked out as 42 times up and 42 times down the hill.\n\n\"We set a date of May 31, set up a JustGiving page, made banners, pushed the\nchallenge on social media and made it happen.\"\n\n\"Lincoln found it incredibly tough and struggled at times, through exhaustion\nand muscle pains.\n\nMany people struggle with one single climb up Penshaw hill, never mind 42.\n\n\"However, what kept him going was the support, and the thought of how much\ndifference this will make to many people's lives.\"\n\nLincoln had hoped to raise \u00a3500 for Centrepoint, but growing support meant he\nhas now passed his target and is hoping to do more.\n\nLincoln said: \"I chose to do this for Centrepoint to help homeless and\nvulnerable young people - they are people's sisters, brothers, fathers,\nmothers, sons and daughters and they need our help.\"\n\nChloe Skyes, regional fundraising manager at Centrepoint, said: \"We are so\ngrateful for Lincoln and his dad's support especially during this challenging\ntime for everyone.\n\n\"Centrepoint research shows Sunderland has 26 per cent more young people\nexperiencing or at risk of homelessness than the national average, so support\nlike this goes a long way.\"\n\n\"The money raised will help make an amazing difference to homeless young\npeople in the North East who face an incredibly difficult time, ensuring they\nhave a safe and stable accommodation and the skills and support to live\nindependently.\"\n\nAt least 4,136 young people across the North East approached their local\nauthority for help last year because they were homeless or at risk of\nhomelessness, according to new findings from Centrepoint's annual Youth\nHomelessness Databank report.\n\nCall Centrepoint Helpline on 0808-800-0661.",
