    "text": "If you've always wanted to try fishing, now is your chance! You may fish\nwithout a license again this year, during the first weekend in June. Take\nadvantage of the free fishing days, June 5, 6 and 7, 2020, and enjoy the great\noutdoors with your family and friends without having to spend money for a\nfishing license.\n\nNo fishing license of any kind will be required for recreational rod and reel\nfishing during free fishing days and facilities use permits will also not be\nrequired during these dates. However, fee-fishing areas (Crooked Creek,\nDouthat, and Clinch Mountain) will still require a permit. To increase angling\nopportunities, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (DGIF) has\nremoved the restriction to fishing designated stocked trout waters. This will\nopen over 2,900 miles of trout streams, in addition to numerous ponds, small\nlakes and reservoirs. Virginia's diversified trout habitat offers a wide range\nof trout fishing prospects. All fishing regulations including size, season,\ncatch limits, and gear restrictions, will remain in effect.\n\n\"Free fishing days are always an excellent opportunity to get out and try\nfishing for the first time, or to introduce new people to fishing,\" said Ryan\nBrown, Executive Director of DGIF. \"I would encourage everyone to take\nadvantage of this opportunity and all that Virginia's outdoors have to offer.\"\n\nThe 2020 Freshwater Fishing and Boating Regulations can be found at the\nVirginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries website at:\n[www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/regulations](http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/regulations).\nPrinted regulations are also available at most major outdoor retailers\nthroughout the state that sell hunting and fishing licenses. In addition, the\nMarine Resources Commission's website, <http://mrc.virginia.gov>, has\nextensive information on Virginia's recreational fishing size, season and\ncreel limits.\n\n\"Free fishing days are a great time to experience the abundance of Virginia's\nwaters from the mountains to the coast,\" said Virginia Marine Resources\nCommissioner Steven G. Bowman. \"We hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable time\nthis weekend, and tight lines!\"\n\nDGIF also has a fun way to recognize a trophy freshwater catch, called The\nOnline Virginia Angler Recognition Program. Annually anglers go online at\n<https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/trophyfish/> to measure up over 6,000\ntrophy-sized fish annually. Since 1963, when the program began, over a\nquarter-million trophy fish awards have been issued.\n\nAnglers are also encouraged to enter the 2020 Kids 'n Fishing Photo Contest.\nFor contest rules visit <https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/kidsnfishing/> or call\n804-367-0969.\n\nFree Fishing Day promo video: <https://youtu.be/MrazV6zPGLg>",

    "html": "<p>If you've always wanted to try fishing, now is your chance! You may fish without a license again this year, during the first weekend in June. Take advantage of the free fishing days, <chron>June 5</chron>, 6 and 7, 2020, and enjoy the great outdoors with your family and friends without having to spend money for a fishing license.</p>\n<p>No fishing license of any kind will be required for recreational rod and reel fishing during free fishing days and facilities use permits will also not be required during these dates. However, fee-fishing areas (<location>Crooked Creek</location>, Douthat, and <location>Clinch Mountain</location>) will still require a permit. To increase angling opportunities, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2268194412\">Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries</org> (DGIF) has removed the restriction to fishing designated stocked trout waters. This will open over 2,900 miles of trout streams, in addition to numerous ponds, small lakes and reservoirs. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia's</location> diversified trout habitat offers a wide range of trout fishing prospects. All fishing regulations including size, season, catch limits, and gear restrictions, will remain in effect.</p>\n\n<p>\"Free fishing days are always an excellent opportunity to get out and try fishing for the first time, or to introduce new people to fishing,\" said <person>Ryan Brown</person>, Executive Director of DGIF. \"I would encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity and all that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia's</location> outdoors have to offer.\"</p>\n\n<p>The 2020 Freshwater Fishing and Boating Regulations can be found at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2268194412\">Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries</org> website at: <a href=\"http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/regulations\">www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/regulations</a>. Printed regulations are also available at most major outdoor retailers throughout the state that sell hunting and fishing licenses. In addition, the <org>Marine Resources Commission's</org> website, <a href=\"http://mrc.virginia.gov\">http://mrc.virginia.gov</a>, has extensive information on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia's</location> recreational fishing size, season and creel limits.</p>\n\n<p>\"Free fishing days are a great time to experience the abundance of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia's</location> waters from the mountains to the coast,\" said Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner <person>Steven G. Bowman</person>. \"We hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable time this weekend, and tight lines!\"</p>\n\n<p>DGIF also has a fun way to recognize a trophy freshwater catch, called The Online Virginia Angler Recognition Program. Annually anglers go online at <a href=\"https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/trophyfish/\">https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/trophyfish/</a> to measure up over 6,000 trophy-sized fish annually. Since 1963, when the program began, over a quarter-million trophy fish awards have been issued.</p>\n\n<p>Anglers are also encouraged to enter the 2020 Kids 'n Fishing Photo Contest. For contest rules visit <a href=\"https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/kidsnfishing/\">https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/kidsnfishing/</a> or call 804-367-0969.</p>\n\n<p>Free Fishing Day promo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MrazV6zPGLg\">https://youtu.be/MrazV6zPGLg</a></p>",
