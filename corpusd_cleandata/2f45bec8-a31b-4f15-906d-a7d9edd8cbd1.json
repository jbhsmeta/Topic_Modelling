    "text": "Tributes have been paid to a \"compassionate and kind\" former head gateman at\nCarrow Road, who was awarded a British Empire Medal.\n\nDavid Smith, from Sprowston, spent his working career at Norfolk County\nCouncil, mainly as a local government officer in a purchasing role and\nlatterly as chief purchasing officer for the highways department.\n\nIn recognition of his dedication and long service, Mr Smith was presented with\nthe British Empire Medal for services to local government in 1992. It was an\nenormously proud moment for all the family and the best-kept secret for months\nbetween receiving the notification letter and the official announcement.\n\nOutside his career Mr Smith was a passionate Norwich City supporter, attending\nmost home games including the famous 1959 FA Cup run, as well as all three cup\nfinals at Wembley.\n\nFrom the late 1970s to early 1990s, Mr Smith was employed as head gateman at\nCarrow Road and held a season ticket in the River End until 2013.\n\nFor many years, he also worked as a gateman at the Royal Norfolk Show.\n\nMr Smith was born in September 1936 on the Larkman Estate in Norwich. He was\npart of a large family, with four sisters, a brother and a half-brother who\nwas killed during the Second World War.\n\nHe attended the City of Norwich School and met his future wife, Pamela, at St\nMary's Church on Low Road in Hellesdon, when he was around 13 years old.\n\nMr Smith was then conscripted to National Service and spent two years at RAF\nWest Kirby on Merseyside and studying radar systems at RAF Neatishead.\n\nOn returning to Norwich, he and Mrs Smith married in September 1959 at St\nMary's Church in Hellesdon, and lived at their home in Elizabeth Close,\nSprowston for over 60 years, where their two sons were also born.\n\nMrs Smith said: \"David will be remembered as a compassionate, kind,\nthoughtful, caring man, who loved to be with his family. He was so proud of\nhis sons, grandchildren and will be missed by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nMr Smith died at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on Tuesday May,\n12 at the age of 83.",
