[Click here to see DHEC's map of COVID-19 cases by zip code.]\n\nDHEC is using mobile testing clinics in their effort to test 2 percent of the\npopulation, or 110,000 South Carolinians per month. The agency met that goal\non Tuesday, in part through the use of mobile testing clinics, most of which\nare free. There are currently 104 clinics scheduled through July 2. [Click\nhere to see a list of mobile clinics.] The state has performed more than\n199,000 tests since the pandemic began.\n\nUpcoming DHEC free mobile testing events for June 1, include one from 2 p.m. \u0096\n4 p.m. at Tidelands Health at the Market Common, 2200 Crow Lane, Myrtle Beach.\n\nAs of May 30, a total of 206,247 tests have been conducted in the state.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, there was a 71.9 percent hospital bed utilization\nrate.\n\nState officials are encouraging residents to stay home when possible and\nminimize contact with people outside their households to slow the spread of\nthe virus, especially considering that people can spread the virus before\nshowing symptoms, and can carry the virus without ever showing symptoms at\nall.\n\n\"We realize that what we are asking everyone to continue to do is not easy,\nbut what we're calling on South Carolininans to do by continuing to practice\nsocial distancing, wearing a mask while in public, and limited their close\ncontacts is critical to controlling the spread of this virus,\" DHEC said in a\nrelease.",
