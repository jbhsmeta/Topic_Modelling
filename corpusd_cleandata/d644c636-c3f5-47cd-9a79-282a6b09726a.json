Alternative Strategies\n    CONCLUSION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nApproximately 2 to 5 percent of the American student population qualifies as\nboth gifted and learning disabled. (1) These students, labeled by educators as\n\"twice-exceptional,\" generally demonstrate superior cognitive ability, yet\nalso present profound weaknesses in seemingly basic skills. (2) This\ndisconnect in twice-exceptional students' abilities produces great\ndifficulties for America's public schools. (3)\n\nTwice-exceptional students, as a result of their disability, can generally\nqualify for special education services under the federal Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEIA). (4) Once a student\nqualifies for services under the IDEIA, he is entitled to receive a Free and\nAppropriate Public Education (FAPE). (5) The IDEIA defines a FAPE as an\neducation that is \"provided at public expense ... meet[s] [state] standards\n... [is] appropriate ... and [is] provided in conformity with [a student's\nindividualized education program].\" (6) Given the general nature of this\nstatutory guidance, the courts have been largely responsible for determining\nwhat constitutes a FAPE. (7) And, while the courts have created relatively\nclear standards, applying these standards to twice-exceptional students has\nproven problematic. (8)\n\nConsider the following case: Per Hovem is a twice-exceptional high school\nsenior in the Klein Independent School District who qualifies for services\nunder the IDEIA. (9) He has superior cognitive ability, as shown through\nintelligence testing, and he makes above-average grades in his general\neducation courses. (10) Yet, despite this, Per's writing ability is subpar,\nfalling around a second-grade level. (11) In fact, Per and his teachers assert\nthat he takes multiple hours to write paragraphs and fill out one-page forms.\n(12) Despite these deficiencies, however, Per can read and comprehend at an\nage-appropriate level. (13) Given Per's mix of abilities, what supports should\nthe Klein Independent School District provide in order to meet its obligation\nto provide Per with a FAPE? Would minor accommodations, such as extra time on\nwritten assignments, suffice? Or is the school district required to do more?\n\nIn making its decision in Per's case, the Fifth Circuit applied the prevailing\nstandard at the time, Board of Education of Hendrick Hudson Central School\nDistrict v. Rowley, which held that a school district met its FAPE obligation\nwhen a student's educational program was \"reasonably calculated to enable the\nchild to receive educational benefits.\" (14) Since Per advanced grade-to-grade\nin his general education courses, the Fifth Circuit held that minimal\naccommodations and services were enough to provide Per with a FAPE. (15)\nMoreover, the Fifth Circuit refused to consider arguments that the school\ndistrict failed to meet its FAPE requirements based on Per's inability to meet\nhis full academic potential. (16)\n\nThe Fifth Circuit's holding represented a typical decision under the Rowley\nstandard. (17) Nevertheless, many special education and disability advocates\nsuggested that such results were problematic. (18)\n\nThese advocates claimed that the Rowley standard was too lenient, allowing\nschool districts to satisfy FAPE requirements without fully addressing\nstudents' needs. (19) Thus, these advocates called for the creation of a more\nrigorous standard--one that would require school districts to do more for\ntheir disabled students. (20)\n\nAdvocates' pleas were seemingly answered when the Supreme Court handed down\nits 2017 decision in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District RE-1. (21)\nThough Endrew dealt with a \"traditionally\" disabled, non-twice-exceptional\nstudent, Endrew clarified the Rowley decision and, by most accounts, raised\nthe FAPE standard by placing a greater emphasis on the student's individual\nabilities. (22) Specifically, Endrew held that a student's educational program\nshould be \"reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress\nappropriate in light of the child's circumstances,\" (23) Yet, despite\nadvocates' general belief that Endrew will raise the FAPE standard for\ndisabled students as a whole, there is some evidence that the new standard\nwill have only a slight impact on twice-exceptional students specifically.\n(24)\n\nTo address this claim, this Note will proceed in three main parts. Part I\ndescribes the twice-exceptional student population in greater detail. In\naddition, this Part discusses education law generally, highlighting federal\nspecial education law, the FAPE standard, and gifted education. Part II\nexplains why the Endrew decision may not impact twice-exceptional students to\nthe same level it could affect nongifted, disabled students. Part III then\nsuggests that twice-exceptional students should receive greater protection.\nThis Part argues that amending the IDEIA is unlikely to be successful.\nAdditionally, it proposes that the states individually adopt Gifted\nIndividualized Education Provisions to supplement students' protection under\nthe IDEIA and ensure that twice-exceptional students' weaknesses and strengths\nare both appropriately considered.\n\nI. FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\nTo qualify for services under the IDEIA, a student needs to fit into one of\nthirteen disability categories listed in 20 U.S.C. [section] 1401(3)(A)(i).\n(25) Notably, \"twice-exceptional\" is not a listed disability category. (26)\nNevertheless, twice-exceptional students can (and do) qualify for services so\nlong as their disability falls within the IDEIA's disability categories and\nthe student can demonstrate that, as a result of the disability, he \"needs\nspecial education and related services.\" (27) Additionally, given that twice-\nexceptional students are gifted or cognitively superior in at least some\nacademic areas, twice-exceptional students may also qualify for a school's\ngifted programming. (28)\n\nBecause twice-exceptional students present both disability and giftedness,\ntheir educational needs stretch across different educational laws and policy\nareas. (29) Thus, to provide a complete overview of the legal landscape, this\nPart will provide a basic introduction to both federal special education law\nas well as relevant federal and state gifted education programs.\n\nA. What Is a Twice-Exceptional Student?\n\nThe term \"twice-exceptional student\" (at its most basic level) refers to\nstudents who are both gifted and disabled. (30) In other words, these students\nmeet traditional qualifications for giftedness--that is, high cognition and\npotential for high achievement--but these students also qualify as disabled\nunder the IDEIA. (31)\n\nDue to this unique spread of giftedness and disability, twice-exceptional\nstudents are often overlooked and can be difficult to identify. (32) In fact,\ntwice-exceptional students have been described by educators as \"the most\nmisjudged, misunderstood, and neglected segment of the student population.\"\n(33) Commentators illustrate the difficulties of identifying twice-exceptional\nstudents by dividing these students into three general categories: (1)\nstudents whose giftedness largely masks their disability, (2) students whose\ndisability masks their giftedness, and (3) students whose giftedness and\ndisability cancel each other out, making these students appear \"average.\" (34)\n\nThese identification difficulties matter because twice-exceptional students\nface great difficulty in the classroom if their divergent needs are not met.\n(35) For instance, if a student's giftedness is overlooked he may become\ndisinterested or face feelings of frustration; likewise, if a student's\ndisability is overlooked, he may become overwhelmed and develop a low self-\nesteem. (36) Moreover, research suggests that these feelings, if not\naddressed, may prompt a twice-exceptional student to act out and develop other\nbehavioral issues in the classroom--resulting in a potential loss of\ninstructional time for both the student and his peers. (37)\n\nPerhaps most problematic, however, are these students' academic progress. A\ntwice-exceptional student, due to his giftedness, often has the ability (at\nleast in some academic areas) to learn at an accelerated pace. (38) And,\nunlike \"traditionally\" disabled students, twice-exceptional students can often\nmask their deficits by developing coping mechanisms. (39) Thus, two general\nproblems can easily arise if a student's education programming is not tailored\ncorrectly: (1) a student may experience regression (or stagnation) in an area\nof strength if he is not pushed appropriately and (2) a student may pass\ngrade-to-grade without learning fundamental skills if he uses his gifts to\nmask his deficits. (40)\n\nTwice-exceptional student classroom placement also proves difficult. (41)\nWithin a traditional public school environment, disabled students have two\ngeneral placement options: mainstream classrooms (general education classrooms\nwith nondisabled peers) or self-contained classrooms (classrooms that contain\nonly disabled students). (42) If neither of these options proves wholly\nappropriate, a student may also receive intermediary \"push-in\" or \"pull-out\"\nservices, where a student receives a mixture of mainstream and special\neducation. (43) Given twice-exceptional students' cognitive abilities and\nIDEIA requirements that a student be placed in the least restrictive\nenvironment, (44) many twice-exceptional students participate primarily in the\nmainstream environment. (45)\n\nB. An Overview of Federal Special Education Law\n\nSpecial education is regulated through federal law. (46) All states currently\nreceive funding through the federal IDEIA, meaning that the states must meet\nminimum requirements, such as providing disabled students with a FAPE. (47)\nThe following discussion will track the history of this law as well as discuss\nits current provisions.\n\n1\\. Special Education Law Between 1960 and 2004\n\nBeginning in the mid-1960s, Congress began to develop legislation to support\ndisabled students. (48) These early legislative efforts resulted in the\ncreation of federal grant programs. (49) The grant programs were meant to\nmotivate the states to dedicate resources to students with disabilities. (50)\nDespite congressional intent, however, the grant programs proved largely\nineffective. (51) In fact, approximately ten years after the passage of the\nfirst grant program, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a\ncongressional investigation revealed \"that of the more than 8 million children\n... with handicapping conditions requiring special education and related\nservices, only 3.9 million such children [were] receiving an appropriate\neducation [, and additionally] 1.75 million handicapped children ...\nreceiv[ed] no educational services at all.\" (52)\n\nIn response to these staggering statistics, Congress renewed its efforts to\nprovide educational opportunities to disabled students and passed the\nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (EAHCA). (53) Unlike the\nprevious grant programs, the EAHCA offered federal funds to the states only if\na state committed to comply with the conditions of the Act. (54)\n\nThe EAHCA was amended several times. (55) Each amendment expanded the scope of\nthe law and offered disabled students further protections. (56) In 1990, the\nEAHCA was reauthorized, and Congress renamed it the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA). (57) Throughout the 1990s, Congress\ncontinued to amend the IDEA. (58) Again, these amendments continued to expand\nthe scope of the Act, most notably shifting the focus from disabled students'\naccess to the school building to these students' access to the general\neducation curriculum. (59)\n\nThe most recent reauthorization occurred in 2004. (60) As part of this\nreauthorization, Congress renamed the statute, calling it the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEIA), (61) and continued to\nexpand the law by providing an increased focus on accountability and improved\nstudent outcomes. (62)\n\n2\\. The IDEIA\n\nThe IDEIA is an \"ambitious\" law. (63) Like its earlier iterations, the IDEIA\nprovides states with federal funds earmarked for disabled students so long as\nthe state commits to complying with the IDEIA's statutory requirements. (64)\n\nThough complex, the IDEIA is best understood as a law that sets forth a\ncomprehensive procedural framework for the purpose of ensuring disabled\nstudents' substantive rights. (65) The right to a FAPE is a critical\nsubstantive right protected by the IDEIA. (66)\n\nThe FAPE requirement has been in place since the passage of the EAHCA. (67)\nDespite the FAPE requirement's long existence in federal law, however, the\nlanguage describing FAPE has not meaningfully changed. (68) Thus, pre-IDEIA\ncases (such as Rowley) remain relevant. The IDEIA currently describes FAPE as:\n\n[S]pecial education and related services that--(A) have been provided at\npublic expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge;\n(B) meet the standards of the State educational agency; (C) include an\nappropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the\nState involved; and (D) are provided in conformity with the individualized\neducation program required under section 614(d). (69)\n\nCommentators note that the IDEIA's FAPE requirement is nonspecific. (70) Thus,\nFAPE's definition is largely drawn from case law. (71) That said, the\nstatutory definition does provide some guidance. Specifically, the IDEIA's\ndefinition requires that special education be \"provided in conformity with the\nindividualized education program,\" or \"IEP.\" (72) Importantly, an IEP is the\nmain avenue for determining whether a student has been denied a FAPE. (73)\n\nAn IEP is a written document that is created by a student's school team\n(generally consisting of a regular education teacher, a special education\nteacher, and school or district administrators) and his parent or guardian.\n(74) An IEP is a document that is tailored to the specific student for whom it\nis written, though it must comport with [section] 1414(d) of the IDEIA. (75)\nThe document contains a statement of the student's current level of academic\nand functional performance and, based on this, lists out specific goals for\nthat student and the various special education and related services that the\nstudent will receive. (76) An IEP is updated annually and therefore changes\nand develops as the student progresses through his schooling. (77)\n\nC. The FAPE Standard\n\nDespite its length and complexity, the IDEIA provides only minimal guidance to\nthe states in regard to the FAPE requirements. (78) Thus, school districts\nlargely rely on the courts' interpretation of the FAPE standard. (79)\n\nThe United States Supreme Court first reviewed the FAPE standard in Rowley.\n(80) Administrative law judges and federal courts relied on Rowley's\ninterpretation of the FAPE standard for thirty-five years. (81) Then, in 2017,\nthe Court readdressed and clarified the FAPE standard in Endrew. (82)\nImportantly, Endrew did not overturn Rowley M The Court did signal some\nalterations to the Rowley standard for some students, however. (84) The next\ntwo Sections will provide a brief overview of Rowley and Endrew and, more\nimportantly, will discuss how the Court modified the FAPE standard.\n\n1\\. Standard Adopted in Rowley\n\nAt issue in Rowley was whether plaintiff Amy Rowley\\--a deaf first-grade\nstudent who was succeeding academically--was receiving a FAPE. (85) Amy's\nparents believed that she was denied a FAPE because her IEP offered a hearing\naid (and other services) rather than a sign-language interpreter. (86)\n\nTo resolve the issue, Amy's parents began due process proceedings. (87) Both\nan independent examiner and the New York Commissioner of Education held that\nAmy was not denied a FAPE. (88) Amy's parents then brought an action in United\nStates District Court, which held that Amy was denied a FAPE. (89)\nSpecifically, the court found that even though Amy \"perform[ed] better than\nthe average child in her class and ... advanced] easily from grade to grade,\"\nthat Amy \"understood] considerably less of what [went] on in class than she\ncould if she were not deaf.\" (90) The court held that this \"disparity between\nAmy's achievement and her potential\" was enough to constitute a FAPE\nviolation. (91) Thus, the district court held that a student was denied a FAPE\nif his IEP allowed disparities between his performance and his potential. (92)\nThe school district appealed the ruling, but the Second Circuit affirmed the\ndistrict court's decision. (93)\n\nThe United States Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit--holding that Amy\nwas not denied a FAPE. (94) The Court explicitly rejected the idea that a FAPE\nrequired a student's full potential to be realized and further noted that\nstates did not need to ensure equality of services or opportunities between\nits nondisabled and disabled students. (95)\n\nThough the Supreme Court restricted its analysis to the specific factual\nscenario in Rowley, future courts derived a general standard from the\ndecision: namely, that in order to comply with its FAPE requirements, a school\nmust ensure that a disabled student's IEP is \"reasonably calculated to enable\nthe child to receive educational benefits.\" (96) More specifically, the Court\nheld that as a general rule, academically successful disabled students--that\nis, disabled students in general education courses who passed from grade-to-\ngrade--could largely be monitored by \"the system itself.\" (97) In other words,\nthe Court suggested that when a disabled student was able to pass his courses\nin a general education environment that he almost certainly was not denied a\nFAPE, regardless of the disparity between his potential and his actual\nperformance. (98)\n\n2\\. Standard Adopted in Endrew\n\nAfter the Court's Rowley decision, a circuit split emerged regarding the\namount of \"educational benefit[]\" the FAPE standard required. (99) The\nmajority of circuits held that disabled students needed to have only \"some\neducational benefit\" in order to receive a FAPE. (100) A minority of the\ncircuits, on the other hand, used a \"heightened 'meaningful educational\nbenefit standard.'\" (101) The Supreme Court granted certiorari to Endrew in\norder to resolve this split and to determine what level of educational benefit\nwas required for a school to satisfy its FAPE requirements. (102)\n\nEndrew F., a fifth-grade student with autism, attended public school from\npreschool through fourth grade. (103) Unlike Amy Rowley, however, Endrew was\nnot a strong student and, according to his parents, he had stopped growing\nacademically and functionally. (104) His IEPs corroborated his parents'\nconcerns, since his annual IEP goals were stagnant and reflected little to no\nacademic advancement. (105)\n\nAfter receiving a similar IEP for Endrew's fifth grade year, Endrew's parents\ndecided to unilaterally remove him from public school and place him in a\nprivate day school for students with disabilities. (106) Endrew's parents then\nbegan due process proceedings, arguing that they were entitled to\nreimbursement for private school costs since their son had been denied a FAPE.\n(107) A state administrative law judge held that Endrew had not been denied a\nFAPE. (108) This decision was affirmed by the United States District Court for\nthe District of Colorado and eventually by the Tenth Circuit. (109)\n\nThe Tenth Circuit specifically noted that Endrew received a FAPE since he had\ndemonstrated at least \"some progress.\" (110) The court, using Rowley to\njustify its decision, held that so long as a disabled student's IEP was\nwritten to create more than a de minimis educational benefit, the IEP was\nadequate. (111)\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit, holding that the \"merely more\nthan de minimis\" standard failed to ensure that students received a FAPE.\n(112) The Court proposed a new standard drawn heavily from Rowley: \"To meet\nits substantive obligation under the [IDEIA], a school must offer an IEP\nreasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light\nof the child's circumstances.\" (113) Given the highly personalized nature of\nIEPs, the Court explained that it could not define what \"'appropriate'\nprogress\" looked like in each case. (114) The Court did, however, provide\nseveral general suggestions. (115) Throughout its ruling, the Court suggested\nthat, as in Rowley, grade-to-grade advancement of disabled students in\nmainstream classrooms may be enough; however, the Court also noted that\ndisabled students \"should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.\"\n(116)\n\nD. An Overview of Gifted Education\n\nUnlike special education for disabled students, which has received much\nfederal attention, gifted education is largely within the exclusive purview of\nstate law. (117) This Section describes the limited federal policy in addition\nto providing an overview of state gifted education law.\n\n1\\. Federal Gifted Education\n\nFederal legislation, such as the IDEIA, has helped ensure that disabled\nstudents receive at least some protection. (118) Unlike disabled students,\ngifted students have not received such federal attention. (119) And, though\nthere have been some attempts to establish federal gifted programs, these\nprograms (at least at the federal level) have waned in and out of favor over\ntime.\n\nGifted education was a high priority in the late 1950s. (120) As part of the\nNational Defense Education Act of 1958, Congress allocated federal funding to\nthe states in an effort to provide gifted education programming. (121) In the\n1960s, interest in gifted education waned; however, the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act of 1965 did provide some funding for gifted students.\n(122) In 1969, Congress renewed its interest in gifted education and passed\nThe Gifted and Talented Children's Education Assistance Act of 1969. (123)\nThis Act, like its predecessor, provided federal funding for gifted\nprogramming. (124) Interest in gifted education continued to rise during the\nearly 1970s. (125) One of the most significant legislative victories for\ngifted education occurred as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education\nAct of 1974. (126) This Act created the Office of the Gifted and Talented and\nauthorized appropriations for gifted and talented education. (127) These\nadvances were further supplemented by the 1978 Gifted and Talented Children's\nEducation Act. (128) Unfortunately for advocates of gifted and talented\neducation, much of the advances of the 1970s were lost as a result of the 1981\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which repealed the 1978 Gifted and Talented\nChildren's Education Act and closed the Office of the Gifted and Talented.\n(129)\n\nCurrently, the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act\n(Javits Act) governs federal gifted and talented education. (130) Unlike the\nIDEIA, which provides substantive and procedural safeguards for disabled\nstudents, (131) the Javits Act is a funding program that supports programs,\nprojects, and research that help schools better identify and serve gifted and\ntalented students. (132) In other words, though the Javits Act supports\neducational programming for gifted and talented students, it neither provides\nnationwide standards nor implements safeguards for students whose needs are\nnot met. (133)\n\n2\\. State Gifted Education\n\nSince the federal government does not require that the states have gifted\nprograms or policies in place, the overall scope of gifted education varies\nwidely at the state level. (134) Given the relative dearth of gifted\nprogramming at the federal level, one might assume that the states would have\nrelatively comprehensive gifted education programming to fill in the gap. Such\nan assumption, however, is largely inaccurate. A substantial number of states\nhave no mandatory gifted education policy and, furthermore, those states that\nhave policies in place often provide only limited funding to support gifted\nprograms. (135) This diversity in programming has led to wide \"disparities in\nservices\" across the states, leading to criticism from some education advocacy\ngroups. (136) Of the states that mandate gifted education, a range of programs\nand policies have been instituted, including: (1) Gifted Individualized\nEducation Programs (GIEPs), (2) special classes for gifted students, and (3)\nacceleration programs. (137) In addition to focusing on specific student\nprogramming, states have also created a variety of procedural requirements.\n(138) Some states, for instance, have parental notification requirements,\nteacher training requirements, or provisions that require the hiring of a\ngifted education administrator. (139)\n\nII. THE PROBLEM: DID ENDREW MODIFY THE FAPE STANDARD FOR TWICE-EXCEPTIONAL\nSTUDENTS?\n\nAfter the Supreme Court decided Endrew, many advocates suggested that the\ndecision would have a significant impact on America's disabled student\npopulation since the new standard would \"dramatically expand[]\" the FAPE\nrequirement. (140) While it is true that Endrew could have a notable impact on\nmany of America's disabled students, the fact remains that Endrew's FAPE\nstandard will have a more modest effect on twice-exceptional students. (141)\nThis Part begins by summarizing advocates' main arguments regarding Endrew's\nimpact on disabled students and twice-exceptional students. The remainder of\nthis Part will discuss why these views, especially those attributed to twice-\nexceptional students, are overstated.\n\nA. Advocates' Reading of Endrew\n\nEndrew, on the whole, failed to add meaningful protections for twice-\nexceptional students. Nevertheless, some advocates (namely parent groups and\ndisability rights organizations) have begun to suggest otherwise. (142) Since\nadvocates' opinions provide a useful starting point for considering the Endrew\nstandard, this Section will consider some of the most common arguments and\nreadings advocates have made post-Endrew. Importantly, advocates' readings are\noften supported by the text of Endrew (and may even be accurate when\nconsidering traditionally disabled students). (143) However, the opinions are\noften steeped in a narrow comparison of the new and old FAPE standards and\ntend to highlight specific, isolated language from Endrew without considering\nthe decision as a whole. (144)\n\nAdvocates accurately cite Endrew's central holding that \"a school district\nmust offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress\nappropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\" (145) And, advocates\nreasonably suggest that this holding heightened the \"appropriate\" prong of the\nFAPE standard since the Court in Endrew--unlike that in Rowley--established\nthat \"some\" or \"de minimis\" progress is insufficient. (146) To advocates, this\n(at a minimum) removed lower court reliance on Rowley's \"some educational\nbenefit\" language, meaning that trivial academic progression will no longer\nsatisfy a school's FAPE requirement. (147) This interpretation of the law,\nespecially when considering nongifted, disabled students, is largely correct.\nIssues arise, however, when advocates attempt to use this framework to assess\nthe impact on twice-exceptional students. (148) Since twice-exceptional\nstudents have the ability to progress through the curriculum at grade-level\n(or above grade-level) rates, (149) the move from Rowley to Endrew largely\nfails to affect twice-exceptional students, at least to the degree advocates\nwould suggest.\n\nA potential advocate's reading of the Endrew holding can be best understood by\nconsidering a hypothetical: Suppose that a twice-exceptional student with\ndyslexia has historically received high scores in mainstream math courses. In\nhis current math course, however, the student struggles due to the high number\nof word problems used. Thanks to the student's high cognitive ability, the\nstudent is able to pass, albeit with a \"D\" average. Reviewing the\naforementioned FAPE standard alone, an advocate may suggest that Endrew\nrequires the school to provide the student with extra services or\naccommodations despite his passing grade. After all, when viewing the\nstudent's historical data, one could surmise that his low (but passing) score\nis not \"appropriate\" given his former success in mathematics. Moreover, one\ncould argue that the student is only exhibiting trivial progress and,\ntheoretically, may be regressing.\n\nThis particular reading of the Endrew FAPE standard is further bolstered by\nspecific, isolated language from Endrew, which--at first glance--appears to\nraise the FAPE standard for twice-exceptional students like the student in the\nhypothetical. (150) First, Endrew, more so than Rowley, highlights the\nimportance of actual, observable progress, noting that an IEP's purpose is to\nenable a disabled student to progress academically and/or functionally. (151)\nIn this vein, advocates often cite Endrew's call for a \"markedly more\ndemanding\" standard. (152) These advocates then juxtapose this with some lower\ncourts' interpretations of Rowley, including the Tenth Circuit's de minimis\nstandard, which, in effect, allowed for negligible student progress. (153)\n\nSecond, advocates focus on particular passages in Endrew. These passages,\nadvocates suggest, give bite to the individualized nature of FAPE, stating not\nonly that students should make \"appropriate []\" progress based on their unique\ntraits and circumstances, but also that students should be given \"the chance\nto meet challenging objectives.\" (154) As advocates suggest, this language in\nEndrew, at least when considered in isolation, could make a difference for\ntwice-exceptional students. (155) In the hypothetical, for instance, an\nadvocate could argue that the student's passing grade is not enough to dismiss\nhis FAPE claim since a court would need to consider whether the material\nappropriately \"challenged]\" the twice-exceptional student. (156) Assuming the\nstudent's issues are with the reading of word problems rather than the math\nitself, this language from Endrew could theoretically support a holding that\nthe hypothetical student be placed in an accelerated program. Similarly,\nlanguage from Endrew could support a twice-exceptional student's participation\nin a dual enrichment/specialized instruction program, especially if the\nstudent's reading deficit was causing limited progress or a regression in his\nmath skills. (157)\n\nFinally, when viewed in isolation, the language in Endrew could support\nadvocates' position since the language appears to raise Rowley's \"floor of\nopportunity,\" (158) and thereby increase the level of progress required. The\n\"floor of opportunity\" language in Rowley suggested that very little was\nrequired of the states--namely, that disabled students had \"access\" to the\nphysical school building. (159) Endrew hints that the Rowley fact situation\nand the governing law at the time, the EAHCA, rendered a focus on actual\nacademic benefit unnecessary. (160) And, though Endrew fails to\ncomprehensively describe the shift from the EAHCA to the modern IDEIA,\nscholars have recognized that the various amendments and reauthorizations of\nthe IDEIA may raise the FAPE standard. This is because the IDEIA (as opposed\nto the EAHCA) focuses on disabled students' access to the general educational\ncurriculum as opposed to their ability to access physical school buildings.\n(161)\n\nTaken together, advocates' reading of Endrew is a potential windfall for the\ntwice-exceptional student. Under such a constricted reading, students must\nprogress at a pace that far exceeds the de minimis standard and other \"some\"\nprogress standards. Considering the historic academic gains of twice-\nexceptional students, this new standard may require more than mere grade-to-\ngrade progress. Though such a reading is theoretically possible, a holistic\nunderstanding of the opinion suggests that it is not what the Court intended.\n\nB. A Holistic Reading of Endrew\n\nTwice-exceptional students are unlikely to experience significant change as a\nresult of the Supreme Court's Endrew opinion. This claim is supported by three\npoints: (1) the heightened language in Endrew is directed at students who are\nnot progressing in a general education environment, (2) the Endrew opinion\nreaffirms Rowley's assumptions and central holding, and (3) the purpose of the\nIDEIA and other fairness concerns will prevent heightened Endrew language from\ndramatically increasing the FAPE standard for twice-exceptional students.\n\n1\\. The Heightened Language in Endrew Is Directed at Students Not Progressing\nin a Mainstream Environment\n\nThe heightened language scattered throughout Endrew (for example, \"challenging\nobjectives,\" \"markedly more demanding,\" and \"ambitious in light of [the\nchild's] circumstances\") is not presented in isolation. (162) Take the\n\"challenging objectives\" language, for in stance. (163) On its own, a\nstudent's right \"to meet challenging objectives\" appears to raise the FAPE\nstandard for twice-exceptional students. (164) Such language could mean that a\ntwice-exceptional student is placed in gifted courses with supports, or\nperhaps, that a student's IEP goals are written to require a higher level of\naccuracy and precision, not just a passable understanding of a concept. (165)\nThe issue with such a reading is that the \"challenging objectives\" language,\nwhen read in its full context, retains the restrictive mainstreaming and\ngrade-to-grade advancement language from Rowley. (166) This section of the\nEndrew opinion, in full, reads: \"[The student's] educational program must be\nappropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances, just as advancement\nfrom grade to grade is appropriately ambitious for most children in the\nregular classroom. The goals may differ, but every child should have the\nchance to meet challenging objectives.\" (167) Here, the Court juxtaposes\ngrade-to-grade advancement as the standard on the high end of the spectrum\nwith \"challenging objectives\" as a lower alternative. (168) Thus, read in its\nbroader context, it appears that the Court intended this language to affect\ndisabled students outside of the general education curriculum (that is,\nnonmainstreamed students) who, additionally were unable to meet grade-level\nstandards. In other words, if a student in a self-contained, special education\nenvironment is not able to make yearly grade-level growth, the Court will\naccept his limited progress so long as the student was offered \"the chance to\nmeet challenging objectives.\" (169)\n\nThe \"challenging objectives\" language loses even more of its force when\nconsidering twice-exceptional students' placement. Twice-exceptional students,\ncompared to their nongifted, disabled peers, are more likely to be\nmainstreamed. (170) As previously mentioned, IDEIA provisions mandate that a\nstudent be placed in the least restrictive environment. (171) Thus, given\ntwice-exceptional students' giftedness (or, at the very least, their general\nability to develop coping mechanisms), many will participate in mainstream\ncourses--meaning that grade-to-grade level advancement will be the basic test\nto determine whether a student received a FAPE. (172)\n\nYet, even for those nonmainstreamed, twice-exceptional students (or those\ntwice-exceptional students who are not progressing grade-to-grade each year in\nall courses), this \"challenging objective\" language may still fail to provide\nmuch benefit since some lower courts have occasionally utilized a \"holistic\"\napproach when reviewing a student's progress. (173) The holistic approach\nconsiders a disabled student's \"overall academic record,\" not the student's\nindividual deficiencies, when determining if a FAPE violation has occurred.\n(174) Under this approach, a student's deficiencies may be disregarded if he\nhas made \"appropriate\" progress in his other courses, (175) meaning that a\nstudent need not even pass all courses to be considered advancing from grade-\nto-grade. This is problematic for twice-exceptional students, many of whom\nexcel in certain academic areas but need intense support in others. (176)\n\nThus, while Endrew's heightened language scattered throughout the opinion is\ncertainly helpful for low-performing students and those in wholly special\neducation courses, it is unlikely that this language will help twice-\nexceptional students' arguments that they have been denied a FAPE, since the\nlanguage seems specifically written to deal with students on the lower end of\nthe spectrum.\n\n2\\. Endrew Reaffirms Rowley's Assumptions and Central Holding\n\nImportantly, Endrew declined to overturn Rowley. (177) Instead, the Court\nminimized Rowley's applicability when handling \"close[] cases\"--such as Endrew\n--while reaffirming some of Rowley's major tenets, (178) notably: (1) the\neducational system's ability to effectively monitor students in mainstream\ncourses, (179) (2) the appropriateness of grade-to-grade advancement, (180)\nand (3) the belief that lower-functioning disabled students should receive\nmore protections and services than higher-functioning disabled students. (181)\nGiven this, Rowley's general standard still stands, albeit with the caveat\nthat if grade-to-grade advancement in mainstream courses is not made that the\nstudent's progress should at least be \"appropriate in light of [his]\ncircumstances.\" (182)\n\nYet, despite Endrew's general endorsement of Rowley, some commentators and\nadvocates have noted that dicta from Endrew could limit Rowley's\napplicability. (183) Unlike the Rowley decision, which clearly emphasized that\nmainstream grade-to-grade progress generally meant that a student received a\nFAPE, (184) Endrew seemingly placed less weight on this contention, even going\nso far as to state that grade-to-grade progress \"should not be interpreted as\nan inflexible rule\" and, moreover, that just because a disabled child\nprogresses grade-to-grade does not mean that he automatically receives a FAPE.\n(185) Theoretically, commentators suggest, this language could be used to\ntwice-exceptional students' advantage since twice-exceptional students are the\nvery students who could advance grade-to-grade without achieving\n\"appropriately ambitious\" goals. (186)\n\nNevertheless, this language is unlikely to raise the FAPE standard for twice-\nexceptional students since this dicta does not distinguish Endrew from Rowley.\n(187) Though rarely cited by commentators interpreting Endrew, Rowley contains\na footnote with similar language: \"We do not hold today that every handicapped\nchild who is advancing from grade to grade ... is automatically receiving a\n[FAPE].\" (188) Thus, even though the Endrew dicta, on its face, seems\npromising, it will not actually change how the lower courts interpret Endrew\nsince similar language has existed for over thirty years. (189)\n\nIt is possible, however, that the language was meant to apply to twice-\nexceptional students who, like the student in the earlier hypothetical, (190)\nprogress at a grade-to-grade level, but even with advancement may be\nregressing over time. Such an issue has not yet been discussed at length by\nthe courts, possibly because proving regression could be difficult. However,\neven if regression was proven, such an interpretation still seems unlikely.\n(191) Rowley, lower court cases, and Endrew all adopt the logic that\nsystematic advancement is all that is really promised to any student--disabled\nor not. (192) Thus, as will be discussed below, it seems unlikely that the\nCourt would promise twice-exceptional students more protections (or better\neducational outcomes) than their nondisabled peers by holding that a certain\nlevel of proficiency is required for the FAPE standard to be met. (193) More\nlikely, the Court's dicta was included as a placeholder to prevent bad\nbehavior from school districts. (194) For instance, this language could likely\nbe used if a school district artificially raised a child's grades to ensure\nthat he passed. (195)\n\nOf course, it should be noted that some post-Endrew, twice-exceptional student\ndecisions have slightly softened on the grade-to-grade language previously\ndiscussed. (196) However, a review of these decisions, at least as of early\n2019, suggests that the reduced reliance on grade-to-grade language only\noccurs when a twice-exceptional student's abilities are so out of balance with\nhis progress that the student's IEP objectives must have been patently\nunsuitable from the beginning. (197) For instance, in Student v. Prince\nGeorge's County Public Schools, a state administrative law judge held that a\ntwice-exceptional student was denied a FAPE because the school did not\nconsider the student's advanced cognitive abilities. (198) This student had an\nIQ of 121 (superior range) and was identified as having \"superior verbal\ncomprehension, superior perceptual reasoning or nonverbal reasoning and gifted\nverbal abstract thinking.\" (199) Despite the student's clear cognitive\nabilities and some supports in the classroom, however, the student was\napproximately one year behind in his reading abilities. (200) The state\nadministrative law judge suggested, in line with advocates' opinions, that the\nstudent's giftedness needed to be taken into consideration and further that he\nshould have been advancing at a quicker rate. (201) However, it should be\nnoted that this situation was unique in that (1) the school provided no\nreading goals despite the student's obvious needs and (2) the school did not\never consider the student's unique status as twice-exceptional (demonstrated\nby the school's placement of the student in the lowest-level reading class and\nhis teachers' commentary that they had low expectations of the student's\nabilities). (202) Had the school done the bare minimum (e.g., created an IEP\nthat addressed all needs and trained teachers on twice-exceptionality) it is\nlikely that the administrative law judge would not have reached the same\nconclusion. (203) After all, in several similar cases post-Endrew, the courts\nhave ruled that twice-exceptional students behind grade-level are receiving a\nFAPE when some minimum action is taken. (204)\n\nThus, there may be some slight shift post-Endrew when considering cases such\nas Student v. Prince George's County Public Schools. Such a shift, however,\nappears to mainly occur when a school fails to consider a student as an\nindividual. (205) Otherwise, the lower courts' post-Endrew cases do not\nsubstantially differ from those decided post-Rowley. (206) As noted, however,\nthis is not completely surprising given the Court's general adoption of\nRowley's major tenets.\n\n3\\. The IDEIA's Purpose and Other Fairness Concerns Will Prevent Heightened\nEndrew Language from Increasing the FAPE Standard\n\nEndrew, like Rowley, wholly rejects the \"equal opportunity\" argument raised by\nstudent petitioners, claiming that the IDEIA does not demand equality between\ndisabled students and their nondisabled peers. (207) Since the Court rejected\nan equality standard, it can also be assumed that the Court would similarly\nreject any standard that requires that disabled students receive more than\ntheir nondisabled peers.\n\nEndrew's FAPE standard clearly addresses and protects disabled students in\nself-contained environments and students who are not advancing grade-to-grade.\n(208) Specifically, Endrew suggests that these students should receive extra\nsupport until they are progressing at individually appropriate levels. (209)\nThus, Endrew allows disabled students to receive services that help them reach\nthe progress that nondisabled students make (namely, grade-to-grade\nadvancement). (210) But, the Court is also clear that schools are not required\nto help disabled students progress at rates exceeding those to which a\nnondisabled student is entitled. (211) Therefore, given that twice-exceptional\nstudents largely participate in the general educational curriculum, it is\nhighly unlikely that Endrew would ever mandate services that help a student\nmeet \"challenging objectives\" or make \"appropriate\" progress if these\nobjectives or progress required more than grade-to-grade advancement. (212) In\nother words, a twice-exceptional student (like a nondisabled student) will be\nconfined to services and supports that get him to progress at a grade level\nrate. (213) Once the twice-exceptional student progresses at a more advanced\nrate, however, a school will likely not provide services--even if this means\nthat the student is trivially progressing or experiencing regression in some\nskills. (214)\n\nSuch a conclusion is perhaps unsurprising. After all, the IDEIA does not\ninclude \"giftedness\" as a category for eligibility, and thus, it should come\nas no surprise that giftedness will not be supported. (215) Moreover, even if\na particular judge believed that a student deserved more than grade-to-grade\nadvancement, his decision would likely be overturned on the longstanding\npremise highlighted in both Endrew and Rowley that judges cannot substitute\ntheir own beliefs when considering school policy. (216)\n\nIII. A POTENTIAL SOLUTION: FOCUSING ON TWICE-EXCEPTIONAL STUDENTS' GIFTS\n\nEndrew's substantive FAPE standard largely failed to produce meaningful change\nfor the twice-exceptional student population. (217) Grade-to-grade progress is\nstill generally considered sufficient, and, given the language in Endrew, it\nappears that a twice-exceptional student could experience inconsistent\nprogress--or even some regression--while still receiving a FAPE. (218)\n\nGiven this reality, what can be done to ensure that twice-exceptional students\nare actually progressing at individually appropriate levels? Furthermore, how\ncan school districts and state legislatures ensure that twice-exceptional\nstudents' academic deficiencies are actually addressed? There is no perfect\nsolution, especially given the variation between individual twice-exceptional\nstudents. (219) Nevertheless, a state statutory creation--Gifted\nIndividualized Education Plans (GIEPs)--could offer additional protections for\ntwice-exceptional students and ensure that these students, (220) like their\ntraditionally disabled counterparts, progress at levels \"appropriate in light\nof [their] circumstances.\" (221) And, since GIEPs are state creations, they\nare not tied to the IDEIA and, therefore, can function independently from\nEndrew and Rowley's substantive FAPE standard. (222)\n\nA. What Is a GIEP?\n\nA GIEP is a document that is similar in form and substance to an IEP. (223) A\nnotable distinction, of course, is that a GIEP provides specialized education\nto assist giftedness whereas an IEP provides specialized education to assist a\ndisability. (224) This means that unlike an IEP, which will regularly include\nservices and accommodations to support deficiencies (for example, shorter\nassignments, a one-on-one aide, or speech services), (225) a GIEP will include\nenrichment-based services and accommodations (for example, accelerated\ncourses, cluster grouping with gifted peers, or online education). (226)\n\nLike an IEP, a GIEP is an annual document that, under most frameworks,\ncontains (1) a statement describing the student's current performance; (2) a\nlist of tailored, measurable academic goals; and (3) a list of accommodations\nand services that the school district will provide in order to help the\nstudent progress in the classroom and meet his annual goals. (227) Depending\non the state statute, the GIEP may share other similarities with the IEP.\n(228) For instance, a GIEP statute can be written to provide a student and his\nparents with certain legal protections, safeguards, and causes of action when\nthe GIEP is not implemented correctly or when the student fails to receive an\nappropriate education. (229)\n\nOf course, GIEPs, unlike IEPs, are not mandated by the IDEIA or any other\nfederal law. (230) Rather, GIEPs are created via state statute or regulation.\n(231) Currently, only a handful of states offer GIEPs. (232) Importantly, this\nmeans that the actual implementation and effectiveness of GIEPs will be based\non the state's statutory language and state court interpretation of such\nlanguage. (233) Yet, despite some minor state-by-state variation, states that\nutilize GIEPs have a consistent goal: to provide gifted students a tailored,\nindividualized, and appropriate education. (234)\n\nB. How Can GIEPs Assist Twice-Exceptional Students?\n\nUsing a GIEP to ensure that a twice-exceptional student is receiving an\nappropriate education may seem counterintuitive. After all, if the student is\nregressing or declining academically, how is specialized gifted education\ngoing to support him? The question is a good one, yet it ignores a crucial\nfact about twice-exceptional students. Namely, these students' gifts and\ndeficits are intertwined and, without a holistic understanding of the student\n(his strengths and his weaknesses), he may not make appropriate progress.\n(235)\n\nConsider a student with a specific learning disability. Perhaps the student\nexcels in reading comprehension but cannot write proficiently. According to\nEndrew, this twice-exceptional student's IEP should consider the student as an\nindividual, clarify where the student struggles, and develop goals to help the\nstudent progress in that area. (236) Since the student struggles in writing,\nthe student's IEP goal may read as follows: \"When given a topic, the student\nwill use complete sentences with 80 percent accuracy in four out of five\ntrials.\" Additionally, the student may receive services, such as pullout\ninstruction, where a special education teacher remediates certain writing\nskills. These measures will help the student overcome his writing deficit.\nWhile focusing on this writing goal, however, it is possible that the student\nmay experience regression in his area of strength--reading comprehension.\n(237) This is especially likely if the student is placed or grouped in a\nlower-level class that matches his writing ability or if the student's\nteachers do not challenge the student appropriately. (238)\n\nBy supplementing this student's IEP with a GIEP, it is possible that the\nstudent's strengths can also be addressed, allowing the student's education to\ntruly focus on his \"unique circumstances.\" (239) While the student receives\nwriting remediation via his IEP, he could also, per his GIEP, be placed in\nenrichment activities, pull-out instruction with a gifted teacher, or online\ninstruction to ensure that his reading comprehension abilities do not\nstagnate. Though the exact mix of supports and services may vary, what is\nclear is that, with a GIEP and IEP, the twice-exceptional student can actually\nreceive what Endrew promised: appropriate progress throughout the curriculum.\n(240) This sentiment is mentioned in a Philadelphia City School District case\nthat described the interaction between a student's GIEP and IEP:\n\n    \n    \n    [O]ne of the remarkable characteristics of the IEP and GIEP is how\n       craftily the district has weaved specialized education across\n       Student's entire regular and gifted education programs, assuring\n       the very structure and continuity Student requires ... while\n       remaining fluid enough to identify and accommodate the ever\n       changing intellectual, emotional, and social needs unique to\n       Student as an individual. (241)\n\nIt is important to briefly recognize that adding a GIEP will not necessarily\nresult in a wholly \"equal\" education and may still not provide a student with\nthe ability to maximize his potential. (242) In fact, the Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt, when analyzing GIEPs, came to the same conclusion as federal courts\nanalyzing IEPs, stating that a GIEP's implementation does not imply that a\nstudent will receive the best, most desirable education. (243) Rather, the\naddition of a GIEP, like an IEP, helps provide a twice-exceptional student\nwith the opportunity to make appropriate progress through out the curriculum.\n(244) Additionally, a GIEP could help ensure that the student's progress in\none academic area is not stymied by a weakness in another academic area. (245)\n\nMoreover, the addition of the GIEP helps promote the general purpose of the\nIDEIA (and prior special education laws). (246) The EAHCA, a predecessor of\nthe current IDEIA, was originally enacted to prevent disabled students from\n\"sitting idly in [the] classroom [] awaiting the time when they were old\nenough to 'drop out.'\" (247) Studies of twice-exceptional students show that\nwithout instruction that addresses their needs holistically, they are at an\nincreased risk of growing frustrated, developing behavior problems, and even\ndropping out. (248) Thus, implementing a GIEP requirement that helps meet\nthese students' needs only further serves the original purpose of special\neducation law. (249)\n\nC. Implementing GIEPs\n\nTo give GIEP provisions legally binding force, and to best help twice-\nexceptional students, state legislatures should incorporate the provisions\ninto their current education laws. Several states have GIEP provisions in\ntheir state codes. (250) Such provisions could be used as model legislation.\nOf these several provisions, Pennsylvania's is perhaps the most comprehensive\nand has been praised by commentators and parents. (251) Thus, a state seeking\nto utilize and incorporate GIEPs into its current education laws should model\nits state laws after Pennsylvania Code section 16.32. Section 16.32 details,\namong other things, (1) what a GIEP must include, (2) what rights attach to a\nGIEP, and (3) what timeline schools must follow when preparing and\nimplementing GIEPs. (252)\n\nPennsylvania's gifted education provisions constitute an entire, independent\nchapter within the state code. (253) This means that, unlike some states,\nPennsylvania's gifted provisions are not embedded within the state's general\neducation provisions or within the state's special education provisions. (254)\nThus, a state could easily append a similar GIEP provision to its current\ngifted education laws or education laws generally. Furthermore, a state could\neasily tailor the Pennsylvania provisions to meet its unique needs.\n\nOnce GIEP legislation is in place, actual implementation of the law would be\nrelatively simple. Since GIEPs are functionally and substantively similar to\nIEPs, implementation would not be difficult for a state's schools. (255) All\nstates currently receive IDEIA funding. (256) This means that all states are\nresponsible for following the IDEIA provisions, including the implementation\nof IEPs. (257) Thus, since schools are already familiar with IEPs, there\nshould be little confusion if GIEP provisions are adopted by a state\nlegislature.\n\nD. Potential Issues\n\nAdding GIEPs to a state's laws could certainly help many twice-exceptional\nstudents. Yet, despite this, there are several reasons why a state may choose\nnot to enact GIEP laws. These reasons could include (1) the expense of\nimplementing such legislation and (2) a general lack of concern for twice-\nexceptional students.\n\nFirst, costs may bar state implementation of GIEPs. Though the writing and\ncreation of the GIEP document is not expensive, the services and\naccommodations promised in such a document could be costly. (258) Screening\nstudents for eligibility, creating enrichment opportunities, and providing\naccess to online education, among other things, could prove to be expensive;\nlikewise, any procedural safeguards created in GIEP legislation could prove\nexpensive, especially if parents frequently exercise these rights. (259) These\ncosts are likely to be noticeable, especially if a state does not already fund\ngifted education. (260)\n\nThough these concerns are legitimate, especially given that gifted education,\nunlike special education, is not federally funded, costs need not be\nexorbitant. The exact language of a state's GIEP provisions would determine\nthe cost, and the costs could be tailored state-by-state. In an effort to\nreduce costs, states could decide to limit the number of students eligible for\na GIEP. In other words, a state with a broad, generalized definition of\ngiftedness could adjust its current provisions to require that a student\ndemonstrate certain test scores or achievements. (261) Importantly, narrowing\nthe definition of giftedness could exclude some twice-exceptional students who\nfail to meet the statutory requirements. (262) However, a state hoping to\nbenefit twice-exceptional students specifically could easily overcome this by\nwriting a separate definition of giftedness for students qualifying under the\nIDEIA. Alternatively, states could limit GIEP provisions solely to twice-\nexceptional students by requiring IDEIA eligibility in order to qualify under\nGIEP provisions. (263) Though perhaps less effective, a state could also limit\ncosts without cutting the number of eligible students by restricting the types\nof accommodations and services it offers or by limiting students' causes of\naction under GIEP provisions.\n\nAdditionally, states could design GIEP provisions with their current laws in\nmind. Currently, over two-thirds of states mandate gifted education in some\nform. (264) Thus, these states could likely tailor GIEP legislation in a way\nthat utilizes the programs and policies that these states have already\ndesigned. Likewise, approximately two-thirds of the states either partially or\nfully fund gifted education. (265) These states could redesign their current\nspending in a way that comports with GIEP legislation.\n\nSecond, a general lack of concern for twice-exceptional students could lead a\nstate not to implement GIEP provisions. (266) This lack of concern is\ngenerally steeped in either a lack of awareness or a belief that gifted\nstudents generally do not need support, regardless of their disabilities.\n(267) Unfortunately, these beliefs may be difficult to overcome. Yet, since\nevery state implements the IDEIA and, therefore, has some interest in serving\nAmerica's special education students, it would stand to reason that states\nwould be willing to fully support this subset of students as well.\n\nE. Alternative Strategies\n\nAs previously mentioned, GIEP legislation does not offer a perfect solution\nfor twice-exceptional students. (268) Though there are perhaps options that\ncould better serve twice-exceptional students, these options are either\nunrealistic or present the same challenges described above. (269)\nNevertheless, for comparative purposes, some alternative solutions will\nbriefly be discussed.\n\nAnother way to serve twice-exceptional students would be to amend the IDEIA\nand include either giftedness (or twice-exceptionality) as a disability\ncategory. (270) As of now, the IDEIA does not explicitly identify either.\n(271) If giftedness were recognized as a category, the courts may demand that\nschools accommodate more than mere grade-to-grade progress. (272) The fact is,\nhowever, that giftedness is unlikely to be recognized as a category. Special\neducation law has recognized the same thirteen categories since 1990. (273)\nAnd, based on the legislative history of the IDEIA, which appeared to\nprioritize the lowest-functioning disabled students, it is unlikely that\ngiftedness will be recognized in the near future. (274)\n\nSome states, however, have incorporated giftedness as an eligibility category\nwithin their special education law. (275) Unfortunately, the effect of these\nstatutes on twice-exceptional students is difficult to determine since, at the\ntime of this writing, there are no published cases fully examining how twice-\nexceptional students are treated under such provisions. The effect would\nlikely be similar to GIEP provisions in Pennsylvania, where a twice-\nexceptional student's GIEP and IEP are merged into one cohesive document.\n(276) It would appear that a state that has giftedness as an eligibility\ncategory would do the same. There are two drawbacks to this approach, however.\nFirst, states would have a more difficult time narrowing gifted education\nprovisions since, presumably, giftedness would be treated like all other\neligibility categories. This, as previously mentioned, may increase costs.\n(277) Second, states using this approach most likely use Endrew and Rowley as\nguidelines for their gifted provisions. This may mean that the level of\nprogress would be no different than how twice-exceptional students are\ncurrently treated under federal law. (278)\n\nCompared to these possible approaches, using a GIEP provision to ensure twice-\nexceptional students' needs are met provides perhaps the most workable\nsolution for the states. Unlike the alternative approaches briefly discussed\nhere, GIEP provisions permit state courts the freedom to interpret and expand\ngifted provisions beyond what is allowed in Endrew.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhile the Endrew decision positively affected special education students on\nthe whole, the decision's impact on twice-exceptional students is less clear.\nAs of this writing, the impact on twice-exceptional students has been minimal\n--unless a school district clearly fails to recognize a student's twice-\nexceptional nature. (279) It appears, however, that the Endrew decision will\nfail to bring about substantial change or live up to some advocates'\nexpectations. The language of the decision, its adherence to Rowley, and\nfairness concerns all suggest this. (280)\n\nEven if Endrew fails to bring about monumental change, states can still better\nserve their twice-exceptional student populations. State-based provisions,\nsuch as Gifted Individualized Education Plans, can help twice-exceptional\nstudents by addressing their gifts and weaknesses collectively and by ensuring\nthat these students receive an \"appropriately ambitious\" education.

Of those states that did fund gifted\neducation, the amount ranged from approximately $150,000 to $157.2 million.\nSee id. Even assuming consistent funding, however, state gifted programs would\nstill differ given that state-based definitions of giftedness vary. States\nthat focus exclusively on \"academically gifted\" students, for instance,\ncapture a different student population than those that recognize \"creative[]\ngiftedness,\" for instance. See id. at 13-14.\n\n(136.) Haney, supra note 119, at 287. The lack of comprehensive state support\nfor gifted programming likely stems, at least partly, from funding concerns.\nCompared to other students, gifted students' needs appear less critical. This\nperception, however, is largely inaccurate. Studies suggest that \"gifted\nstudents do not make it on their own [and] ... underachiev[e] relative to\ntheir potential.\" Elizabeth A.

The rejection of the \"automatic\" rule did little for twice-exceptional\nstudents in the thirty years post-Rowley. See, e.g., N.P. v. Maxwell, No.\n16-1164, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 24803, at *1-5 (4th Cir. Dec. 8, 2017) (failing\nto use dicta for twice-exceptional student who apparently was progressing\ngrade-to-grade); Klein Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Hovem, 690 F.3d 390 (5th Cir.\n2012) (failing to use dicta for twice-exceptional student who was advancing\ngrade-to-grade, but lacked basic skills). The post-Rowley cases generally drew\na hard line between successful, cognitively advanced students such as Amy\nRowley and struggling students with lower cognition such as Endrew F. Compare\nHovem, 690 F.3d at 398-400, with J.M. v. Morris Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., No.\nlO-cv-06660, 2011 WL 6779546, at *15 (D.N.J. Dec. 23, 2011). Given the Endrew\nCourt's explicit discussion of these students' differences, it appears that\nthe Endrew decision will not support a different understanding. See Endrew F.,\n137 S. Ct. at 996, 999-1000.\n\n(190.) See supra Part II.A.\n\n(191.) Generally, under Rowley, some level of regression or failure has been\nacceptable. See supra note 191 and accompanying text. Under Endrew, there is\nsome minor indication that regression is not acceptable; however, individuals\nprimarily bring this claim at the administrative law judge level. See Student\nv.

Alternative Strategies\nCONCLUSION</pre>\n\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p>\n\n<p>Approximately 2 to 5 percent of the American student population\nqualifies as both gifted and learning disabled. (1) These students,\nlabeled by educators as \"twice-exceptional,\" generally\ndemonstrate superior cognitive ability, yet also present profound\nweaknesses in seemingly basic skills. (2) This disconnect in\ntwice-exceptional students' abilities produces great difficulties\nfor America's public schools. (3)</p>\n\n<p>Twice-exceptional students, as a result of their disability, can\ngenerally qualify for special education services under the federal\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEIA).\n(4) Once a student qualifies for services under the IDEIA, he is\nentitled to receive a Free and Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). (5)\nThe IDEIA defines a FAPE as an education that is \"provided at\npublic expense ... meet[s] [state] standards ... [is] appropriate ...\nand [is] provided in conformity with [a student's individualized\neducation program].\" (6) Given the general nature of this statutory\nguidance, the courts have been largely responsible for determining what\nconstitutes a FAPE. (7) And, while the courts have created relatively\nclear standards, applying these standards to twice-exceptional students\nhas proven problematic. (8)</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following case: Per Hovem is a twice-exceptional high\nschool senior in the <org>Klein Independent School District</org> who qualifies for\nservices under the IDEIA. (9) He has superior cognitive ability, as\nshown through intelligence testing, and he makes above-average grades in\nhis general education courses. (10) Yet, despite this, Per's\nwriting ability is subpar, falling around a second-grade level. (11) In\nfact, Per and his teachers assert that he takes multiple hours to write\nparagraphs and fill out one-page forms. (12) Despite these deficiencies,\nhowever, Per can read and comprehend at an age-appropriate level. (13)\nGiven Per's mix of abilities, what supports should the <org>Klein\nIndependent School District</org> provide in order to meet its obligation to\nprovide Per with a FAPE? Would minor accommodations, such as extra time\non written assignments, suffice? Or is the school district required to\ndo more?</p>\n\n<p>In making its decision in Per's case, the Fifth Circuit\napplied the prevailing standard at the time, <org>Board of Education</org> of\n<org>Hendrick Hudson Central School District</org> v. Rowley, which held that a\nschool district met its FAPE obligation when a student's\neducational program was \"reasonably calculated to enable the child\nto receive educational benefits.\" (14) Since Per advanced\ngrade-to-grade in his general education courses, the Fifth Circuit held\nthat minimal accommodations and services were enough to provide Per with\na FAPE. (15) Moreover, the Fifth Circuit refused to consider arguments\nthat the school district failed to meet its FAPE requirements based on\nPer's inability to meet his full academic potential. (16)</p>\n\n<p>The Fifth Circuit's holding represented a typical decision\nunder the Rowley standard. (17) Nevertheless, many special education and\ndisability advocates suggested that such results were problematic. (18)</p>\n\n<p>These advocates claimed that the Rowley standard was too lenient,\nallowing school districts to satisfy FAPE requirements without fully\naddressing students' needs. (19) Thus, these advocates called for\nthe creation of a more rigorous standard--one that would require school\ndistricts to do more for their disabled students. (20)</p>\n\n<p>Advocates' pleas were seemingly answered when the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme\nCourt</org> handed down its 2017 decision in Endrew F. v. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.doulas\">Douglas County</location>\nSchool District RE-1. (21) Though Endrew dealt with a\n\"traditionally\" disabled, non-twice-exceptional student,\nEndrew clarified the Rowley decision and, by most accounts, raised the\nFAPE standard by placing a greater emphasis on the student's\nindividual abilities. (22) Specifically, Endrew held that a\nstudent's educational program should be \"reasonably calculated\nto enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the\nchild's circumstances,\" (23) Yet, despite advocates'\ngeneral belief that Endrew will raise the FAPE standard for disabled\nstudents as a whole, there is some evidence that the new standard will\nhave only a slight impact on twice-exceptional students specifically.\n(24)</p>\n\n<p>To address this claim, this Note will proceed in three main parts.\nPart I describes the twice-exceptional student population in greater\ndetail. In addition, this Part discusses education law generally,\nhighlighting federal special education law, the FAPE standard, and\ngifted education. Part II explains why the Endrew decision may not\nimpact twice-exceptional students to the same level it could affect\nnongifted, disabled students. Part III then suggests that\ntwice-exceptional students should receive greater protection. This Part\nargues that amending the IDEIA is unlikely to be successful.\nAdditionally, it proposes that the states individually adopt Gifted\nIndividualized Education Provisions to supplement students'\nprotection under the IDEIA and ensure that twice-exceptional\nstudents' weaknesses and strengths are both appropriately\nconsidered.</p>\n\n<p>I. FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n\n<p>To qualify for services under the IDEIA, a student needs to fit\ninto one of thirteen disability categories listed in 20 U.S.C. [section]\n1401(3)(A)(i). (25) Notably, \"twice-exceptional\" is not a\nlisted disability category. (26) Nevertheless, twice-exceptional\nstudents can (and do) qualify for services so long as their disability\nfalls within the IDEIA's disability categories and the student can\ndemonstrate that, as a result of the disability, he \"needs special\neducation and related services.\" (27) Additionally, given that\ntwice-exceptional students are gifted or cognitively superior in at\nleast some academic areas, twice-exceptional students may also qualify\nfor a school's gifted programming. (28)</p>\n\n<p>Because twice-exceptional students present both disability and\ngiftedness, their educational needs stretch across different educational\nlaws and policy areas. (29) Thus, to provide a complete overview of the\nlegal landscape, this Part will provide a basic introduction to both\nfederal special education law as well as relevant federal and state\ngifted education programs.</p>\n\n<p>A. What Is a Twice-Exceptional Student?</p>\n\n<p>The term \"twice-exceptional student\" (at its most basic\nlevel) refers to students who are both gifted and disabled. (30) In\nother words, these students meet traditional qualifications for\ngiftedness--that is, high cognition and potential for high\nachievement--but these students also qualify as disabled under the\nIDEIA. (31)</p>\n\n<p>Due to this unique spread of giftedness and disability,\ntwice-exceptional students are often overlooked and can be difficult to\nidentify. (32) In fact, twice-exceptional students have been described\nby educators as \"the most misjudged, misunderstood, and neglected\nsegment of the student population.\" (33) Commentators illustrate\nthe difficulties of identifying twice-exceptional students by dividing\nthese students into three general categories: (1) students whose\ngiftedness largely masks their disability, (2) students whose disability\nmasks their giftedness, and (3) students whose giftedness and disability\ncancel each other out, making these students appear \"average.\"\n(34)</p>\n\n<p>These identification difficulties matter because twice-exceptional\nstudents face great difficulty in the classroom if their divergent needs\nare not met. (35) For instance, if a student's giftedness is\noverlooked he may become disinterested or face feelings of frustration;\nlikewise, if a student's disability is overlooked, he may become\noverwhelmed and develop a low self-esteem. (36) Moreover, research\nsuggests that these feelings, if not addressed, may prompt a\ntwice-exceptional student to act out and develop other behavioral issues\nin the classroom--resulting in a potential loss of instructional time\nfor both the student and his peers. (37)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most problematic, however, are these students'\nacademic progress. A twice-exceptional student, due to his giftedness,\noften has the ability (at least in some academic areas) to learn at an\naccelerated pace. (38) And, unlike \"traditionally\" disabled\nstudents, twice-exceptional students can often mask their deficits by\ndeveloping coping mechanisms. (39) Thus, two general problems can easily\narise if a student's education programming is not tailored\ncorrectly: (1) a student may experience regression (or stagnation) in an\narea of strength if he is not pushed appropriately and (2) a student may\npass grade-to-grade without learning fundamental skills if he uses his\ngifts to mask his deficits. (40)</p>\n\n<p>Twice-exceptional student classroom placement also proves\ndifficult. (41) Within a traditional public school environment, disabled\nstudents have two general placement options: mainstream classrooms\n(general education classrooms with nondisabled peers) or self-contained\nclassrooms (classrooms that contain only disabled students). (42) If\nneither of these options proves wholly appropriate, a student may also\nreceive intermediary \"push-in\" or \"pull-out\"\nservices, where a student receives a mixture of mainstream and special\neducation. (43) Given twice-exceptional students' cognitive\nabilities and IDEIA requirements that a student be placed in the least\nrestrictive environment, (44) many twice-exceptional students\nparticipate primarily in the mainstream environment. (45)</p>\n\n<p>B. An Overview of Federal Special Education Law</p>\n\n<p>Special education is regulated through federal law. (46) All states\ncurrently receive funding through the federal IDEIA, meaning that the\nstates must meet minimum requirements, such as providing disabled\nstudents with a FAPE. (47) The following discussion will track the\nhistory of this law as well as discuss its current provisions.</p>\n\n<p>1. Special Education Law Between 1960 and 2004</p>\n\n<p>Beginning in the mid-1960s, <org>Congress</org> began to develop legislation\nto support disabled students. (48) These early legislative efforts\nresulted in the creation of federal grant programs. (49) The grant\nprograms were meant to motivate the states to dedicate resources to\nstudents with disabilities. (50) Despite congressional intent, however,\nthe grant programs proved largely ineffective. (51) In fact,\napproximately ten years after the passage of the first grant program,\nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a congressional\ninvestigation revealed \"that of the more than 8 million children\n... with handicapping conditions requiring special education and related\nservices, only 3.9 million such children [were] receiving an appropriate\neducation [, and additionally] 1.75 million handicapped children ...\nreceiv[ed] no educational services at all.\" (52)</p>\n\n<p>In response to these staggering statistics, <org>Congress</org> renewed its\nefforts to provide educational opportunities to disabled students and\npassed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (EAHCA).\n(53) Unlike the previous grant programs, the EAHCA offered federal funds\nto the states only if a state committed to comply with the conditions of\nthe Act. (54)</p>\n\n<p>The EAHCA was amended several times. (55) Each amendment expanded\nthe scope of the law and offered disabled students further protections.\n(56) In 1990, the EAHCA was reauthorized, and <org>Congress</org> renamed it the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). (57) Throughout the\n1990s, <org>Congress</org> continued to amend the IDEA. (58) Again, these\namendments continued to expand the scope of the Act, most notably\nshifting the focus from disabled students' access to the school\nbuilding to these students' access to the general education\ncurriculum. (59)</p>\n\n<p>The most recent reauthorization occurred in 2004. (60) As part of\nthis reauthorization, <org>Congress</org> renamed the statute, calling it the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEIA),\n(61) and continued to expand the law by providing an increased focus on\naccountability and improved student outcomes. (62)</p>\n\n<p>2. The IDEIA</p>\n\n<p>The IDEIA is an \"ambitious\" law. (63) Like its earlier\niterations, the IDEIA provides states with federal funds earmarked for\ndisabled students so long as the state commits to complying with the\nIDEIA's statutory requirements. (64)</p>\n\n<p>Though complex, the IDEIA is best understood as a law that sets\nforth a comprehensive procedural framework for the purpose of ensuring\ndisabled students' substantive rights. (65) The right to a FAPE is\na critical substantive right protected by the IDEIA. (66)</p>\n\n<p>The FAPE requirement has been in place since the passage of the\nEAHCA. (67) Despite the FAPE requirement's long existence in\nfederal law, however, the language describing FAPE has not meaningfully\nchanged. (68) Thus, pre-IDEIA cases (such as Rowley) remain relevant.\nThe IDEIA currently describes FAPE as:</p>\n\n<p>[S]pecial education and related services that--(A) have been\nprovided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and\nwithout charge; (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency;\n(C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary\nschool education in the State involved; and (D) are provided in\nconformity with the individualized education program required under\nsection 614(d). (69)</p>\n\n<p>Commentators note that the IDEIA's FAPE requirement is\nnonspecific. (70) Thus, FAPE's definition is largely drawn from\ncase law. (71) That said, the statutory definition does provide some\nguidance. Specifically, the IDEIA's definition requires that\nspecial education be \"provided in conformity with the\nindividualized education program,\" or \"IEP.\" (72)\nImportantly, an IEP is the main avenue for determining whether a student\nhas been denied a FAPE. (73)</p>\n\n<p>An IEP is a written document that is created by a student's\nschool team (generally consisting of a regular education teacher, a\nspecial education teacher, and school or district administrators) and\nhis parent or guardian. (74) An IEP is a document that is tailored to\nthe specific student for whom it is written, though it must comport with\n[section] 1414(d) of the IDEIA. (75) The document contains a statement\nof the student's current level of academic and functional\nperformance and, based on this, lists out specific goals for that\nstudent and the various special education and related services that the\nstudent will receive. (76) An IEP is updated annually and therefore\nchanges and develops as the student progresses through his schooling.\n(77)</p>\n\n<p>C. The FAPE Standard</p>\n\n<p>Despite its length and complexity, the IDEIA provides only minimal\nguidance to the states in regard to the FAPE requirements. (78) Thus,\nschool districts largely rely on the courts' interpretation of the\nFAPE standard. (79)</p>\n\n<p><org>The United States Supreme Court</org> first reviewed the FAPE standard in\nRowley. (80) Administrative law judges and federal courts relied on\nRowley's interpretation of the FAPE standard for thirty-five years.\n(81) Then, in 2017, the Court readdressed and clarified the FAPE\nstandard in Endrew. (82) Importantly, Endrew did not overturn Rowley M\nThe Court did signal some alterations to the Rowley standard for some\nstudents, however. (84) The next two Sections will provide a brief\noverview of Rowley and Endrew and, more importantly, will discuss how\nthe Court modified the FAPE standard.</p>\n\n<p>1. Standard Adopted in Rowley</p>\n\n<p>At issue in Rowley was whether plaintiff <person>Amy Rowley</person>--a deaf\nfirst-grade student who was succeeding academically--was receiving a\nFAPE. (85) Amy's parents believed that she was denied a FAPE\nbecause her IEP offered a hearing aid (and other services) rather than a\nsign-language interpreter. (86)</p>\n\n<p>To resolve the issue, Amy's parents began due process\nproceedings. (87) Both an independent examiner and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ny\">New York</location>\nCommissioner of Education held that Amy was not denied a FAPE. (88)\nAmy's parents then brought an action in <org>United States District\nCourt</org>, which held that Amy was denied a FAPE. (89) Specifically, the\ncourt found that even though Amy \"perform[ed] better than the\naverage child in her class and ... advanced] easily from grade to\ngrade,\" that Amy \"understood] considerably less of what [went]\non in class than she could if she were not deaf.\" (90) The court\nheld that this \"disparity between Amy's achievement and her\npotential\" was enough to constitute a FAPE violation. (91) Thus,\nthe district court held that a student was denied a FAPE if his IEP\nallowed disparities between his performance and his potential. (92) The\nschool district appealed the ruling, but the Second Circuit affirmed the\ndistrict court's decision. (93)</p>\n\n<p><org>The United States Supreme Court</org> reversed the Second\nCircuit--holding that Amy was not denied a FAPE. (94) The Court\nexplicitly rejected the idea that a FAPE required a student's full\npotential to be realized and further noted that states did not need to\nensure equality of services or opportunities between its nondisabled and\ndisabled students. (95)</p>\n\n<p>Though the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> restricted its analysis to the specific\nfactual scenario in Rowley, future courts derived a general standard\nfrom the decision: namely, that in order to comply with its FAPE\nrequirements, a school must ensure that a disabled student's IEP is\n\"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational\nbenefits.\" (96) More specifically, the Court held that as a general\nrule, academically successful disabled students--that is, disabled\nstudents in general education courses who passed from\ngrade-to-grade--could largely be monitored by \"the system\nitself.\" (97) In other words, the Court suggested that when a\ndisabled student was able to pass his courses in a general education\nenvironment that he almost certainly was not denied a FAPE, regardless\nof the disparity between his potential and his actual performance. (98)</p>\n\n<p>2. Standard Adopted in Endrew</p>\n\n<p>After the Court's Rowley decision, a circuit split emerged\nregarding the amount of \"educational benefit[]\" the FAPE\nstandard required. (99) The majority of circuits held that disabled\nstudents needed to have only \"some educational benefit\" in\norder to receive a FAPE. (100) A minority of the circuits, on the other\nhand, used a \"heightened 'meaningful educational benefit\nstandard.'\" (101) The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> granted certiorari to\nEndrew in order to resolve this split and to determine what level of\neducational benefit was required for a school to satisfy its FAPE\nrequirements. (102)</p>\n\n<p>Endrew F., a fifth-grade student with autism, attended public\nschool from preschool through fourth grade. (103) Unlike <person>Amy Rowley</person>,\nhowever, Endrew was not a strong student and, according to his parents,\nhe had stopped growing academically and functionally. (104) His IEPs\ncorroborated his parents' concerns, since his annual IEP goals were\nstagnant and reflected little to no academic advancement. (105)</p>\n\n<p>After receiving a similar IEP for Endrew's fifth grade year,\nEndrew's parents decided to unilaterally remove him from public\nschool and place him in a private day school for students with\ndisabilities. (106) Endrew's parents then began due process\nproceedings, arguing that they were entitled to reimbursement for\nprivate school costs since their son had been denied a FAPE. (107) A\nstate administrative law judge held that Endrew had not been denied a\nFAPE. (108) This decision was affirmed by the <org>United States District\nCourt for the District of Colorado</org> and eventually by the Tenth Circuit.\n(109)</p>\n\n<p>The Tenth Circuit specifically noted that Endrew received a FAPE\nsince he had demonstrated at least \"some progress.\" (110) The\ncourt, using Rowley to justify its decision, held that so long as a\ndisabled student's IEP was written to create more than a de minimis\neducational benefit, the IEP was adequate. (111)</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> reversed the Tenth Circuit, holding that the\n\"merely more than de minimis\" standard failed to ensure that\nstudents received a FAPE. (112) The Court proposed a new standard drawn\nheavily from Rowley: \"To meet its substantive obligation under the\n[IDEIA], a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a\nchild to make progress appropriate in light of the child's\ncircumstances.\" (113) Given the highly personalized nature of IEPs,\nthe Court explained that it could not define what\n\"'appropriate' progress\" looked like in each case.\n(114) The Court did, however, provide several general suggestions. (115)\nThroughout its ruling, the Court suggested that, as in Rowley,\ngrade-to-grade advancement of disabled students in mainstream classrooms\nmay be enough; however, the Court also noted that disabled students\n\"should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.\" (116)</p>\n\n<p>D. An Overview of Gifted Education</p>\n\n<p>Unlike special education for disabled students, which has received\nmuch federal attention, gifted education is largely within the exclusive\npurview of state law. (117) This Section describes the limited federal\npolicy in addition to providing an overview of state gifted education\nlaw.</p>\n\n<p>1. Federal Gifted Education</p>\n\n<p>Federal legislation, such as the IDEIA, has helped ensure that\ndisabled students receive at least some protection. (118) Unlike\ndisabled students, gifted students have not received such federal\nattention. (119) And, though there have been some attempts to establish\nfederal gifted programs, these programs (at least at the federal level)\nhave waned in and out of favor over time.</p>\n\n<p>Gifted education was a high priority in the late 1950s. (120) As\npart of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, <org>Congress</org> allocated\nfederal funding to the states in an effort to provide gifted education\nprogramming. (121) In the 1960s, interest in gifted education waned;\nhowever, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 did provide\nsome funding for gifted students. (122) In 1969, <org>Congress</org> renewed its\ninterest in gifted education and passed The Gifted and Talented\nChildren's Education Assistance Act of 1969. (123) This Act, like\nits predecessor, provided federal funding for gifted programming. (124)\nInterest in gifted education continued to rise during the early 1970s.\n(125) One of the most significant legislative victories for gifted\neducation occurred as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1974. (126) This Act created the <org>Office of the Gifted and Talented</org>\nand authorized appropriations for gifted and talented education. (127)\nThese advances were further supplemented by the 1978 Gifted and Talented\nChildren's Education Act. (128) Unfortunately for advocates of\ngifted and talented education, much of the advances of the 1970s were\nlost as a result of the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which\nrepealed the 1978 Gifted and Talented Children's Education Act and\nclosed the <org>Office of the Gifted and Talented</org>. (129)</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students\nEducation Act (Javits Act) governs federal gifted and talented\neducation. (130) Unlike the IDEIA, which provides substantive and\nprocedural safeguards for disabled students, (131) the Javits Act is a\nfunding program that supports programs, projects, and research that help\nschools better identify and serve gifted and talented students. (132) In\nother words, though the Javits Act supports educational programming for\ngifted and talented students, it neither provides nationwide standards\nnor implements safeguards for students whose needs are not met. (133)</p>\n\n<p>2. State Gifted Education</p>\n\n<p>Since the federal government does not require that the states have\ngifted programs or policies in place, the overall scope of gifted\neducation varies widely at the state level. (134) Given the relative\ndearth of gifted programming at the federal level, one might assume that\nthe states would have relatively comprehensive gifted education\nprogramming to fill in the gap. Such an assumption, however, is largely\ninaccurate. A substantial number of states have no mandatory gifted\neducation policy and, furthermore, those states that have policies in\nplace often provide only limited funding to support gifted programs.\n(135) This diversity in programming has led to wide \"disparities in\nservices\" across the states, leading to criticism from some\neducation advocacy groups. (136) Of the states that mandate gifted\neducation, a range of programs and policies have been instituted,\nincluding: (1) Gifted Individualized Education Programs (GIEPs), (2)\nspecial classes for gifted students, and (3) acceleration programs.\n(137) In addition to focusing on specific student programming, states\nhave also created a variety of procedural requirements. (138) Some\nstates, for instance, have parental notification requirements, teacher\ntraining requirements, or provisions that require the hiring of a gifted\neducation administrator. (139)</p>\n\n<p>II. THE PROBLEM: DID ENDREW MODIFY THE FAPE STANDARD FOR\nTWICE-EXCEPTIONAL STUDENTS?</p>\n\n<p>After the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org> decided Endrew, many advocates suggested\nthat the decision would have a significant impact on America's\ndisabled student population since the new standard would\n\"dramatically expand[]\" the FAPE requirement. (140) While it\nis true that Endrew could have a notable impact on many of\nAmerica's disabled students, the fact remains that Endrew's\nFAPE standard will have a more modest effect on twice-exceptional\nstudents. (141) This Part begins by summarizing advocates' main\narguments regarding Endrew's impact on disabled students and\ntwice-exceptional students. The remainder of this Part will discuss why\nthese views, especially those attributed to twice-exceptional students,\nare overstated.</p>\n\n<p>A. Advocates' Reading of Endrew</p>\n\n<p>Endrew, on the whole, failed to add meaningful protections for\ntwice-exceptional students. Nevertheless, some advocates (namely parent\ngroups and disability rights organizations) have begun to suggest\notherwise. (142) Since advocates' opinions provide a useful\nstarting point for considering the Endrew standard, this Section will\nconsider some of the most common arguments and readings advocates have\nmade post-Endrew. Importantly, advocates' readings are often\nsupported by the text of Endrew (and may even be accurate when\nconsidering traditionally disabled students). (143) However, the\nopinions are often steeped in a narrow comparison of the new and old\nFAPE standards and tend to highlight specific, isolated language from\nEndrew without considering the decision as a whole. (144)</p>\n\n<p>Advocates accurately cite Endrew's central holding that\n\"a school district must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to\nenable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's\ncircumstances.\" (145) And, advocates reasonably suggest that this\nholding heightened the \"appropriate\" prong of the FAPE\nstandard since the Court in Endrew--unlike that in Rowley--established\nthat \"some\" or \"de minimis\" progress is\ninsufficient. (146) To advocates, this (at a minimum) removed lower\ncourt reliance on Rowley's \"some educational benefit\"\nlanguage, meaning that trivial academic progression will no longer\nsatisfy a school's FAPE requirement. (147) This interpretation of\nthe law, especially when considering nongifted, disabled students, is\nlargely correct. Issues arise, however, when advocates attempt to use\nthis framework to assess the impact on twice-exceptional students. (148)\nSince twice-exceptional students have the ability to progress through\nthe curriculum at grade-level (or above grade-level) rates, (149) the\nmove from Rowley to Endrew largely fails to affect twice-exceptional\nstudents, at least to the degree advocates would suggest.</p>\n\n<p>A potential advocate's reading of the Endrew holding can be\nbest understood by considering a hypothetical: Suppose that a\ntwice-exceptional student with dyslexia has historically received high\nscores in mainstream math courses. In his current math course, however,\nthe student struggles due to the high number of word problems used.\nThanks to the student's high cognitive ability, the student is able\nto pass, albeit with a \"D\" average. Reviewing the\naforementioned FAPE standard alone, an advocate may suggest that Endrew\nrequires the school to provide the student with extra services or\naccommodations despite his passing grade. After all, when viewing the\nstudent's historical data, one could surmise that his low (but\npassing) score is not \"appropriate\" given his former success\nin mathematics. Moreover, one could argue that the student is only\nexhibiting trivial progress and, theoretically, may be regressing.</p>\n\n<p>This particular reading of the Endrew FAPE standard is further\nbolstered by specific, isolated language from Endrew, which--at first\nglance--appears to raise the FAPE standard for twice-exceptional\nstudents like the student in the hypothetical. (150) First, Endrew, more\nso than Rowley, highlights the importance of actual, observable\nprogress, noting that an IEP's purpose is to enable a disabled\nstudent to progress academically and/or functionally. (151) In this\nvein, advocates often cite Endrew's call for a \"markedly more\ndemanding\" standard. (152) These advocates then juxtapose this with\nsome lower courts' interpretations of Rowley, including the Tenth\nCircuit's de minimis standard, which, in effect, allowed for\nnegligible student progress. (153)</p>\n\n<p>Second, advocates focus on particular passages in Endrew. These\npassages, advocates suggest, give bite to the individualized nature of\nFAPE, stating not only that students should make \"appropriate\n[]\" progress based on their unique traits and circumstances, but\nalso that students should be given \"the chance to meet challenging\nobjectives.\" (154) As advocates suggest, this language in Endrew,\nat least when considered in isolation, could make a difference for\ntwice-exceptional students. (155) In the hypothetical, for instance, an\nadvocate could argue that the student's passing grade is not enough\nto dismiss his FAPE claim since a court would need to consider whether\nthe material appropriately \"challenged]\" the twice-exceptional\nstudent. (156) Assuming the student's issues are with the reading\nof word problems rather than the math itself, this language from Endrew\ncould theoretically support a holding that the hypothetical student be\nplaced in an accelerated program. Similarly, language from Endrew could\nsupport a twice-exceptional student's participation in a dual\nenrichment/specialized instruction program, especially if the\nstudent's reading deficit was causing limited progress or a\nregression in his math skills. (157)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when viewed in isolation, the language in Endrew could\nsupport advocates' position since the language appears to raise\nRowley's \"floor of opportunity,\" (158) and thereby\nincrease the level of progress required. The \"floor of\nopportunity\" language in Rowley suggested that very little was\nrequired of the states--namely, that disabled students had\n\"access\" to the physical school building. (159) Endrew hints\nthat the Rowley fact situation and the governing law at the time, the\nEAHCA, rendered a focus on actual academic benefit unnecessary. (160)\nAnd, though Endrew fails to comprehensively describe the shift from the\nEAHCA to the modern IDEIA, scholars have recognized that the various\namendments and reauthorizations of the IDEIA may raise the FAPE\nstandard. This is because the IDEIA (as opposed to the EAHCA) focuses on\ndisabled students' access to the general educational curriculum as\nopposed to their ability to access physical school buildings. (161)</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, advocates' reading of Endrew is a potential\nwindfall for the twice-exceptional student. Under such a constricted\nreading, students must progress at a pace that far exceeds the de\nminimis standard and other \"some\" progress standards.\nConsidering the historic academic gains of twice-exceptional students,\nthis new standard may require more than mere grade-to-grade progress.\nThough such a reading is theoretically possible, a holistic\nunderstanding of the opinion suggests that it is not what the Court\nintended.</p>\n\n<p>B. A Holistic Reading of Endrew</p>\n\n<p>Twice-exceptional students are unlikely to experience significant\nchange as a result of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1367624464\">Supreme Court</org>'s Endrew opinion. This\nclaim is supported by three points: (1) the heightened language in\nEndrew is directed at students who are not progressing in a general\neducation environment, (2) the Endrew opinion reaffirms Rowley's\nassumptions and central holding, and (3) the purpose of the IDEIA and\nother fairness concerns will prevent heightened Endrew language from\ndramatically increasing the FAPE standard for twice-exceptional\nstudents.</p>\n\n<p>1. The Heightened Language in Endrew Is Directed at Students Not\nProgressing in a Mainstream Environment</p>\n\n<p>The heightened language scattered throughout Endrew (for example,\n\"challenging objectives,\" \"markedly more demanding,\"\nand \"ambitious in light of [the child's] circumstances\")\nis not presented in isolation. (162) Take the \"challenging\nobjectives\" language, for in stance. (163) On its own, a\nstudent's right \"to meet challenging objectives\" appears\nto raise the FAPE standard for twice-exceptional students. (164) Such\nlanguage could mean that a twice-exceptional student is placed in gifted\ncourses with supports, or perhaps, that a student's IEP goals are\nwritten to require a higher level of accuracy and precision, not just a\npassable understanding of a concept. (165) The issue with such a reading\nis that the \"challenging objectives\" language, when read in\nits full context, retains the restrictive mainstreaming and\ngrade-to-grade advancement language from Rowley. (166) This section of\nthe Endrew opinion, in full, reads: \"[The student's]\neducational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his\ncircumstances, just as advancement from grade to grade is appropriately\nambitious for most children in the regular classroom. The goals may\ndiffer, but every child should have the chance to meet challenging\nobjectives.\" (167) Here, the Court juxtaposes grade-to-grade\nadvancement as the standard on the high end of the spectrum with\n\"challenging objectives\" as a lower alternative. (168) Thus,\nread in its broader context, it appears that the Court intended this\nlanguage to affect disabled students outside of the general education\ncurriculum (that is, nonmainstreamed students) who, additionally were\nunable to meet grade-level standards. In other words, if a student in a\nself-contained, special education environment is not able to make yearly\ngrade-level growth, the Court will accept his limited progress so long\nas the student was offered \"the chance to meet challenging\nobjectives.\" (169)</p>\n\n<p>The \"challenging objectives\" language loses even more of\nits force when considering twice-exceptional students' placement.\nTwice-exceptional students, compared to their nongifted, disabled peers,\nare more likely to be mainstreamed. (170) As previously mentioned, IDEIA\nprovisions mandate that a student be placed in the least restrictive\nenvironment. (171) Thus, given twice-exceptional students'\ngiftedness (or, at the very least, their general ability to develop\ncoping mechanisms), many will participate in mainstream courses--meaning\nthat grade-to-grade level advancement will be the basic test to\ndetermine whether a student received a FAPE. (172)</p>\n\n<p>Yet, even for those nonmainstreamed, twice-exceptional students (or\nthose twice-exceptional students who are not progressing grade-to-grade\neach year in all courses), this \"challenging objective\"\nlanguage may still fail to provide much benefit since some lower courts\nhave occasionally utilized a \"holistic\" approach when\nreviewing a student's progress. (173) The holistic approach\nconsiders a disabled student's \"overall academic record,\"\nnot the student's individual deficiencies, when determining if a\nFAPE violation has occurred. (174) Under this approach, a student's\ndeficiencies may be disregarded if he has made \"appropriate\"\nprogress in his other courses, (175) meaning that a student need not\neven pass all courses to be considered advancing from grade-to-grade.\nThis is problematic for twice-exceptional students, many of whom excel\nin certain academic areas but need intense support in others. (176)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while Endrew's heightened language scattered throughout\nthe opinion is certainly helpful for low-performing students and those\nin wholly special education courses, it is unlikely that this language\nwill help twice-exceptional students' arguments that they have been\ndenied a FAPE, since the language seems specifically written to deal\nwith students on the lower end of the spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>2. Endrew Reaffirms Rowley's <org>Assumptions</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"HongKong:1735\">Central Holding</org></p>\n\n<p>Importantly, Endrew declined to overturn Rowley. (177) Instead, the\nCourt minimized Rowley's applicability when handling \"close[]\ncases\"--such as Endrew--while reaffirming some of Rowley's\nmajor tenets, (178) notably: (1) the educational system's ability\nto effectively monitor students in mainstream courses, (179) (2) the\nappropriateness of grade-to-grade advancement, (180) and (3) the belief\nthat lower-functioning disabled students should receive more protections\nand services than higher-functioning disabled students. (181) Given\nthis, Rowley's general standard still stands, albeit with the\ncaveat that if grade-to-grade advancement in mainstream courses is not\nmade that the student's progress should at least be\n\"appropriate in light of [his] circumstances.\" (182)</p>\n\n<p>Yet, despite Endrew's general endorsement of Rowley, some\ncommentators and advocates have noted that dicta from Endrew could limit\nRowley's applicability. (183) Unlike the Rowley decision, which\nclearly emphasized that mainstream grade-to-grade progress generally\nmeant that a student received a FAPE, (184) Endrew seemingly placed less\nweight on this contention, even going so far as to state that\ngrade-to-grade progress \"should not be interpreted as an inflexible\nrule\" and, moreover, that just because a disabled child progresses\ngrade-to-grade does not mean that he automatically receives a FAPE.\n(185) Theoretically, commentators suggest, this language could be used\nto twice-exceptional students' advantage since twice-exceptional\nstudents are the very students who could advance grade-to-grade without\nachieving \"appropriately ambitious\" goals. (186)</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, this language is unlikely to raise the FAPE standard\nfor twice-exceptional students since this dicta does not distinguish\nEndrew from Rowley. (187) Though rarely cited by commentators\ninterpreting Endrew, Rowley contains a footnote with similar language:\n\"We do not hold today that every handicapped child who is advancing\nfrom grade to grade ... is automatically receiving a [FAPE].\" (188)\nThus, even though the Endrew dicta, on its face, seems promising, it\nwill not actually change how the lower courts interpret Endrew since\nsimilar language has existed for over thirty years. (189)</p>\n\n<p>It is possible, however, that the language was meant to apply to\ntwice-exceptional students who, like the student in the earlier\nhypothetical, (190) progress at a grade-to-grade level, but even with\nadvancement may be regressing over time. Such an issue has not yet been\ndiscussed at length by the courts, possibly because proving regression\ncould be difficult. However, even if regression was proven, such an\ninterpretation still seems unlikely. (191) Rowley, lower court cases,\nand Endrew all adopt the logic that systematic advancement is all that\nis really promised to any student--disabled or not. (192) Thus, as will\nbe discussed below, it seems unlikely that the Court would promise\ntwice-exceptional students more protections (or better educational\noutcomes) than their nondisabled peers by holding that a certain level\nof proficiency is required for the FAPE standard to be met. (193) More\nlikely, the Court's dicta was included as a placeholder to prevent\nbad behavior from school districts. (194) For instance, this language\ncould likely be used if a school district artificially raised a\nchild's grades to ensure that he passed. (195)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it should be noted that some post-Endrew,\ntwice-exceptional student decisions have slightly softened on the\ngrade-to-grade language previously discussed. (196) However, a review of\nthese decisions, at least as of early 2019, suggests that the reduced\nreliance on grade-to-grade language only occurs when a twice-exceptional\nstudent's abilities are so out of balance with his progress that\nthe student's IEP objectives must have been patently unsuitable\nfrom the beginning. (197) For instance, in Student v. <person>Prince</person>\nGeorge's <org>County Public Schools</org>, a state administrative law judge\nheld that a twice-exceptional student was denied a FAPE because the\nschool did not consider the student's advanced cognitive abilities.\n(198) This student had an IQ of 121 (superior range) and was identified\nas having \"superior verbal comprehension, superior perceptual\nreasoning or nonverbal reasoning and gifted verbal abstract\nthinking.\" (199) Despite the student's clear cognitive\nabilities and some supports in the classroom, however, the student was\napproximately one year behind in his reading abilities. (200) The state\nadministrative law judge suggested, in line with advocates'\nopinions, that the student's giftedness needed to be taken into\nconsideration and further that he should have been advancing at a\nquicker rate. (201) However, it should be noted that this situation was\nunique in that (1) the school provided no reading goals despite the\nstudent's obvious needs and (2) the school did not ever consider\nthe student's unique status as twice-exceptional (demonstrated by\nthe school's placement of the student in the lowest-level reading\nclass and his teachers' commentary that they had low expectations\nof the student's abilities). (202) Had the school done the bare\nminimum (e.g., created an IEP that addressed all needs and trained\nteachers on twice-exceptionality) it is likely that the administrative\nlaw judge would not have reached the same conclusion. (203) After all,\nin several similar cases post-Endrew, the courts have ruled that\ntwice-exceptional students behind grade-level are receiving a FAPE when\nsome minimum action is taken. (204)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, there may be some slight shift post-Endrew when considering\ncases such as Student v. <person>Prince</person> George's <org>County Public Schools</org>.\nSuch a shift, however, appears to mainly occur when a school fails to\nconsider a student as an individual. (205) Otherwise, the lower\ncourts' post-Endrew cases do not substantially differ from those\ndecided post-Rowley. (206) As noted, however, this is not completely\nsurprising given the Court's general adoption of Rowley's\nmajor tenets.</p>\n\n<p>3. The IDEIA's Purpose and Other Fairness Concerns Will\nPrevent Heightened Endrew Language from Increasing the FAPE Standard</p>\n\n<p>Endrew, like Rowley, wholly rejects the \"equal\nopportunity\" argument raised by student petitioners, claiming that\nthe IDEIA does not demand equality between disabled students and their\nnondisabled peers. (207) Since the Court rejected an equality standard,\nit can also be assumed that the Court would similarly reject any\nstandard that requires that disabled students receive more than their\nnondisabled peers.</p>\n\n<p>Endrew's FAPE standard clearly addresses and protects disabled\nstudents in self-contained environments and students who are not\nadvancing grade-to-grade. (208) Specifically, Endrew suggests that these\nstudents should receive extra support until they are progressing at\nindividually appropriate levels. (209) Thus, Endrew allows disabled\nstudents to receive services that help them reach the progress that\nnondisabled students make (namely, grade-to-grade advancement). (210)\nBut, the Court is also clear that schools are not required to help\ndisabled students progress at rates exceeding those to which a\nnondisabled student is entitled. (211) Therefore, given that\ntwice-exceptional students largely participate in the general\neducational curriculum, it is highly unlikely that Endrew would ever\nmandate services that help a student meet \"challenging\nobjectives\" or make \"appropriate\" progress if these\nobjectives or progress required more than grade-to-grade advancement.\n(212) In other words, a twice-exceptional student (like a nondisabled\nstudent) will be confined to services and supports that get him to\nprogress at a grade level rate. (213) Once the twice-exceptional student\nprogresses at a more advanced rate, however, a school will likely not\nprovide services--even if this means that the student is trivially\nprogressing or experiencing regression in some skills. (214)</p>\n\n<p>Such a conclusion is perhaps unsurprising. After all, the IDEIA\ndoes not include \"giftedness\" as a category for eligibility,\nand thus, it should come as no surprise that giftedness will not be\nsupported. (215) Moreover, even if a particular judge believed that a\nstudent deserved more than grade-to-grade advancement, his decision\nwould likely be overturned on the longstanding premise highlighted in\nboth Endrew and Rowley that judges cannot substitute their own beliefs\nwhen considering school policy. (216)</p>\n\n<p>III. A POTENTIAL SOLUTION: FOCUSING ON TWICE-EXCEPTIONAL\nSTUDENTS' GIFTS</p>\n\n<p>Endrew's substantive FAPE standard largely failed to produce\nmeaningful change for the twice-exceptional student population. (217)\nGrade-to-grade progress is still generally considered sufficient, and,\ngiven the language in Endrew, it appears that a twice-exceptional\nstudent could experience inconsistent progress--or even some\nregression--while still receiving a FAPE. (218)</p>\n\n<p>Given this reality, what can be done to ensure that\ntwice-exceptional students are actually progressing at individually\nappropriate levels? Furthermore, how can school districts and state\nlegislatures ensure that twice-exceptional students' academic\ndeficiencies are actually addressed? There is no perfect solution,\nespecially given the variation between individual twice-exceptional\nstudents. (219) Nevertheless, a state statutory creation--Gifted\nIndividualized Education Plans (GIEPs)--could offer additional\nprotections for twice-exceptional students and ensure that these\nstudents, (220) like their traditionally disabled counterparts, progress\nat levels \"appropriate in light of [their] circumstances.\"\n(221) And, since GIEPs are state creations, they are not tied to the\nIDEIA and, therefore, can function independently from Endrew and\nRowley's substantive FAPE standard. (222)</p>\n\n<p>A. What Is a GIEP?</p>\n\n<p>A GIEP is a document that is similar in form and substance to an\nIEP. (223) A notable distinction, of course, is that a GIEP provides\nspecialized education to assist giftedness whereas an IEP provides\nspecialized education to assist a disability. (224) This means that\nunlike an IEP, which will regularly include services and accommodations\nto support deficiencies (for example, shorter assignments, a one-on-one\naide, or speech services), (225) a GIEP will include enrichment-based\nservices and accommodations (for example, accelerated courses, cluster\ngrouping with gifted peers, or online education). (226)</p>\n\n<p>Like an IEP, a GIEP is an annual document that, under most\nframeworks, contains (1) a statement describing the student's\ncurrent performance; (2) a list of tailored, measurable academic goals;\nand (3) a list of accommodations and services that the school district\nwill provide in order to help the student progress in the classroom and\nmeet his annual goals. (227) Depending on the state statute, the GIEP\nmay share other similarities with the IEP. (228) For instance, a GIEP\nstatute can be written to provide a student and his parents with certain\nlegal protections, safeguards, and causes of action when the GIEP is not\nimplemented correctly or when the student fails to receive an\nappropriate education. (229)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, GIEPs, unlike IEPs, are not mandated by the IDEIA or any\nother federal law. (230) Rather, GIEPs are created via state statute or\nregulation. (231) Currently, only a handful of states offer GIEPs. (232)\nImportantly, this means that the actual implementation and effectiveness\nof GIEPs will be based on the state's statutory language and state\ncourt interpretation of such language. (233) Yet, despite some minor\nstate-by-state variation, states that utilize GIEPs have a consistent\ngoal: to provide gifted students a tailored, individualized, and\nappropriate education. (234)</p>\n\n<p>B. How Can GIEPs Assist Twice-Exceptional Students?</p>\n\n<p>Using a GIEP to ensure that a twice-exceptional student is\nreceiving an appropriate education may seem counterintuitive. After all,\nif the student is regressing or declining academically, how is\nspecialized gifted education going to support him? The question is a\ngood one, yet it ignores a crucial fact about twice-exceptional\nstudents. Namely, these students' gifts and deficits are\nintertwined and, without a holistic understanding of the student (his\nstrengths and his weaknesses), he may not make appropriate progress.\n(235)</p>\n\n<p>Consider a student with a specific learning disability. Perhaps the\nstudent excels in reading comprehension but cannot write proficiently.\nAccording to Endrew, this twice-exceptional student's IEP should\nconsider the student as an individual, clarify where the student\nstruggles, and develop goals to help the student progress in that area.\n(236) Since the student struggles in writing, the student's IEP\ngoal may read as follows: \"When given a topic, the student will use\ncomplete sentences with 80 percent accuracy in four out of five\ntrials.\" Additionally, the student may receive services, such as\npullout instruction, where a special education teacher remediates\ncertain writing skills. These measures will help the student overcome\nhis writing deficit. While focusing on this writing goal, however, it is\npossible that the student may experience regression in his area of\nstrength--reading comprehension. (237) This is especially likely if the\nstudent is placed or grouped in a lower-level class that matches his\nwriting ability or if the student's teachers do not challenge the\nstudent appropriately. (238)</p>\n\n<p>By supplementing this student's IEP with a GIEP, it is\npossible that the student's strengths can also be addressed,\nallowing the student's education to truly focus on his \"unique\ncircumstances.\" (239) While the student receives writing\nremediation via his IEP, he could also, per his GIEP, be placed in\nenrichment activities, pull-out instruction with a gifted teacher, or\nonline instruction to ensure that his reading comprehension abilities do\nnot stagnate. Though the exact mix of supports and services may vary,\nwhat is clear is that, with a GIEP and IEP, the twice-exceptional\nstudent can actually receive what Endrew promised: appropriate progress\nthroughout the curriculum. (240) This sentiment is mentioned in a\n<org>Philadelphia City School District</org> case that described the interaction\nbetween a student's GIEP and IEP:</p>\n\n<pre>[O]ne of the remarkable characteristics of the IEP and GIEP is how\n   craftily the district has weaved specialized education across\n   Student's entire regular and gifted education programs, assuring\n   the very structure and continuity Student requires ... while\n   remaining fluid enough to identify and accommodate the ever\n   changing intellectual, emotional, and social needs unique to\n   Student as an individual. (241)</pre>\n\n<p>It is important to briefly recognize that adding a GIEP will not\nnecessarily result in a wholly \"equal\" education and may still\nnot provide a student with the ability to maximize his potential. (242)\nIn fact, the <org>Pennsylvania Supreme Court</org>, when analyzing GIEPs, came to\nthe same conclusion as federal courts analyzing IEPs, stating that a\nGIEP's implementation does not imply that a student will receive\nthe best, most desirable education. (243) Rather, the addition of a\nGIEP, like an IEP, helps provide a twice-exceptional student with the\nopportunity to make appropriate progress through out the curriculum.\n(244) Additionally, a GIEP could help ensure that the student's\nprogress in one academic area is not stymied by a weakness in another\nacademic area. (245)</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the addition of the GIEP helps promote the general\npurpose of the IDEIA (and prior special education laws). (246) The\nEAHCA, a predecessor of the current IDEIA, was originally enacted to\nprevent disabled students from \"sitting idly in [the] classroom []\nawaiting the time when they were old enough to 'drop\nout.'\" (247) Studies of twice-exceptional students show that\nwithout instruction that addresses their needs holistically, they are at\nan increased risk of growing frustrated, developing behavior problems,\nand even dropping out. (248) Thus, implementing a GIEP requirement that\nhelps meet these students' needs only further serves the original\npurpose of special education law. (249)</p>\n\n<p>C. Implementing GIEPs</p>\n\n<p>To give GIEP provisions legally binding force, and to best help\ntwice-exceptional students, state legislatures should incorporate the\nprovisions into their current education laws. Several states have GIEP\nprovisions in their state codes. (250) Such provisions could be used as\nmodel legislation. Of these several provisions, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania's</location> is\nperhaps the most comprehensive and has been praised by commentators and\nparents. (251) Thus, a state seeking to utilize and incorporate GIEPs\ninto its current education laws should model its state laws after\nPennsylvania Code section 16.32. Section 16.32 details, among other\nthings, (1) what a GIEP must include, (2) what rights attach to a GIEP,\nand (3) what timeline schools must follow when preparing and\nimplementing GIEPs. (252)</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania's</location> gifted education provisions constitute an\nentire, independent chapter within the state code. (253) This means\nthat, unlike some states, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania's</location> gifted provisions are not\nembedded within the state's general education provisions or within\nthe state's special education provisions. (254) Thus, a state could\neasily append a similar GIEP provision to its current gifted education\nlaws or education laws generally. Furthermore, a state could easily\ntailor the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location> provisions to meet its unique needs.</p>\n\n<p>Once GIEP legislation is in place, actual implementation of the law\nwould be relatively simple. Since GIEPs are functionally and\nsubstantively similar to IEPs, implementation would not be difficult for\na state's schools. (255) All states currently receive IDEIA\nfunding. (256) This means that all states are responsible for following\nthe IDEIA provisions, including the implementation of IEPs. (257) Thus,\nsince schools are already familiar with IEPs, there should be little\nconfusion if GIEP provisions are adopted by a state legislature.</p>\n\n<p>D. Potential Issues</p>\n\n<p>Adding GIEPs to a state's laws could certainly help many\ntwice-exceptional students. Yet, despite this, there are several reasons\nwhy a state may choose not to enact GIEP laws. These reasons could\ninclude (1) the expense of implementing such legislation and (2) a\ngeneral lack of concern for twice-exceptional students.</p>\n\n<p>First, costs may bar state implementation of GIEPs. Though the\nwriting and creation of the GIEP document is not expensive, the services\nand accommodations promised in such a document could be costly. (258)\nScreening students for eligibility, creating enrichment opportunities,\nand providing access to online education, among other things, could\nprove to be expensive; likewise, any procedural safeguards created in\nGIEP legislation could prove expensive, especially if parents frequently\nexercise these rights. (259) These costs are likely to be noticeable,\nespecially if a state does not already fund gifted education. (260)</p>\n\n<p>Though these concerns are legitimate, especially given that gifted\neducation, unlike special education, is not federally funded, costs need\nnot be exorbitant. The exact language of a state's GIEP provisions\nwould determine the cost, and the costs could be tailored\nstate-by-state. In an effort to reduce costs, states could decide to\nlimit the number of students eligible for a GIEP. In other words, a\nstate with a broad, generalized definition of giftedness could adjust\nits current provisions to require that a student demonstrate certain\ntest scores or achievements. (261) Importantly, narrowing the definition\nof giftedness could exclude some twice-exceptional students who fail to\nmeet the statutory requirements. (262) However, a state hoping to\nbenefit twice-exceptional students specifically could easily overcome\nthis by writing a separate definition of giftedness for students\nqualifying under the IDEIA. Alternatively, states could limit GIEP\nprovisions solely to twice-exceptional students by requiring IDEIA\neligibility in order to qualify under GIEP provisions. (263) Though\nperhaps less effective, a state could also limit costs without cutting\nthe number of eligible students by restricting the types of\naccommodations and services it offers or by limiting students'\ncauses of action under GIEP provisions.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, states could design GIEP provisions with their\ncurrent laws in mind. Currently, over two-thirds of states mandate\ngifted education in some form. (264) Thus, these states could likely\ntailor GIEP legislation in a way that utilizes the programs and policies\nthat these states have already designed. Likewise, approximately\ntwo-thirds of the states either partially or fully fund gifted\neducation. (265) These states could redesign their current spending in a\nway that comports with GIEP legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Second, a general lack of concern for twice-exceptional students\ncould lead a state not to implement GIEP provisions. (266) This lack of\nconcern is generally steeped in either a lack of awareness or a belief\nthat gifted students generally do not need support, regardless of their\ndisabilities. (267) Unfortunately, these beliefs may be difficult to\novercome. Yet, since every state implements the IDEIA and, therefore,\nhas some interest in serving America's special education students,\nit would stand to reason that states would be willing to fully support\nthis subset of students as well.</p>\n\n<p>E. Alternative Strategies</p>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, GIEP legislation does not offer a perfect\nsolution for twice-exceptional students. (268) Though there are perhaps\noptions that could better serve twice-exceptional students, these\noptions are either unrealistic or present the same challenges described\nabove. (269) Nevertheless, for comparative purposes, some alternative\nsolutions will briefly be discussed.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to serve twice-exceptional students would be to amend\nthe IDEIA and include either giftedness (or twice-exceptionality) as a\ndisability category. (270) As of now, the IDEIA does not explicitly\nidentify either. (271) If giftedness were recognized as a category, the\ncourts may demand that schools accommodate more than mere grade-to-grade\nprogress. (272) The fact is, however, that giftedness is unlikely to be\nrecognized as a category. Special education law has recognized the same\nthirteen categories since 1990. (273) And, based on the legislative\nhistory of the IDEIA, which appeared to prioritize the\nlowest-functioning disabled students, it is unlikely that giftedness\nwill be recognized in the near future. (274)</p>\n\n<p>Some states, however, have incorporated giftedness as an\neligibility category within their special education law. (275)\nUnfortunately, the effect of these statutes on twice-exceptional\nstudents is difficult to determine since, at the time of this writing,\nthere are no published cases fully examining how twice-exceptional\nstudents are treated under such provisions. The effect would likely be\nsimilar to GIEP provisions in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location>, where a twice-exceptional\nstudent's GIEP and IEP are merged into one cohesive document. (276)\nIt would appear that a state that has giftedness as an eligibility\ncategory would do the same. There are two drawbacks to this approach,\nhowever. First, states would have a more difficult time narrowing gifted\neducation provisions since, presumably, giftedness would be treated like\nall other eligibility categories. This, as previously mentioned, may\nincrease costs. (277) Second, states using this approach most likely use\nEndrew and Rowley as guidelines for their gifted provisions. This may\nmean that the level of progress would be no different than how\ntwice-exceptional students are currently treated under federal law.\n(278)</p>\n\n<p>Compared to these possible approaches, using a GIEP provision to\nensure twice-exceptional students' needs are met provides perhaps\nthe most workable solution for the states. Unlike the alternative\napproaches briefly discussed here, GIEP provisions permit state courts\nthe freedom to interpret and expand gifted provisions beyond what is\nallowed in Endrew.</p>\n\n<p>CONCLUSION</p>\n\n<p>While the Endrew decision positively affected special education\nstudents on the whole, the decision's impact on twice-exceptional\nstudents is less clear. As of this writing, the impact on\ntwice-exceptional students has been minimal--unless a school district\nclearly fails to recognize a student's twice-exceptional nature.\n(279) It appears, however, that the Endrew decision will fail to bring\nabout substantial change or live up to some advocates'\nexpectations. The language of the decision, its adherence to Rowley, and\nfairness concerns all suggest this. (280)</p>\n\n<p>Even if Endrew fails to bring about monumental change, states can\nstill better serve their twice-exceptional student populations.\nState-based provisions, such as Gifted Individualized Education Plans,\ncan help twice-exceptional students by addressing their gifts and\nweaknesses collectively and by ensuring that these students receive an\n\"appropriately ambitious\" education.
