    "text": "Keywords: Lithium, Red mud, Leaching, Acetic acid, Oxalic acid\n\nSpecial Extended Abstract\n\nRed mud has been reported as a potential resource for lithium. To investigate\nthe leaching behavior of lithium, a lithium-rich red mud was neutralized with\nhydrochloric or oxalic acid and then leached with acetic acid. When red mud\nwas neutralized using dilute hydrochloric acid, about 58 to 60 percent of\nlithium was leached with 25 percent acetic acid at 95 C for 60 min, while more\nthan 95 percent of sodium and 85 percent of calcium were dissolved in the\nleachate solution. When oxalic acid was used to neutralize red mud prior to\nacetic acid leaching, lower lithium leaching efficiencies of about 42 to 47\npercent were observed. Nevertheless, these leaching efficiencies of lithium\nwere close to that of calcium and much higher than those of sodium under the\nsame conditions. In this study, 25 percent (v/v) of acetic acid at 85 C for 60\nmin was demonstrated to be the optimum conditions for lithium extraction from\noxalic acid-neutralized red mud using acetic acid. The results are useful and\nof interest for lithium recovery and purification from red mud.\n\nBackground\n\nBauxite residue, or red mud, is generated during the Bayer process of alumina\nrecovery from bauxite ore. The chemical compositions of bauxite residues are\nassociated with the alumina process and the raw bauxite ores. Broad ranges of\ncontent are reflected in the six to eight main components and more than 50\ntrace elements. Red mud can be regarded as a polymetallic raw material, or an\nartificial ore, and the recovery of trace valuable elements from red mud,\nincluding rare earth elements [1], scandium [2] and gallium [3], have been\nreported. Lithium resources are crucial raw materials, and red mud has been\nreported as a potential resource for lithium that is transformed from bauxite\nore. Lithium-bearing clays are thought of as a kind of new lithium resource\ndue to the large potential size. Clay minerals in Karst-type bauxite, which\nare the main host phases of lithium, account for high volumes. When alumina is\nextracted during the Bayer process, lithium is concentrated in the residue,\nwith the amount of content depending on the raw ores. Knowing the leaching\nbehavior of lithium from red mud will help with lithium recovery and\npurification for further processing.\n\nMethod\n\nThe red-mud sample used in this study was HN, a lower iron diaspore Bayer red\nmud obtained from Henan, China, as described in previous literature [4]. HN is\none of the typical bauxite residues generated in Henan province, China, with\nlithium content of 224 pg/g. As reported previously [5], the main chemical\ncomposition of HN is, by weight percent: Al2O3 22.54, SiO2 19.70, Fe2O3 9.69,\nCaO 17.65, TiO2 6.82, Na2O 4.12, K2O 2.10 and MgO 1.44.\n\nDilute hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid were used for HN red-mud\nneutralization treatment, producing hydrochloric acid-neutralized HN and\noxalic acid-neutralized HN for subsequent acetic acid leaching. The leaching\nefficiency of a given element in this study was calculated, and effect\nparameters, including acetic acid concentration, reaction temperature and\nreaction time, were investigated.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nAfter neutralizing with hydrochloric or oxalic acid, a lithium-rich red mud\nwas leached using acetic acid to investigate the leaching behavior of lithium.\nAfter neutralizing with dilute hydrochloric acid at 0.01 mol/L, 58.04 to 60.27\npercent of lithium was leached using 25 percent acetic acid at 95 C for 60\nminutes. In addition, more than 95 percent of sodium and 85 percent of calcium\nwere dissolved in the leachate solution. The dilute hydrochloric acid used in\nthis study only extracted 0.52 percent of lithium in the process of\nneutralization treatment. Therefore, a higher leaching efficiency of lithium\nwas obtained with hydrochloric acidneutralized HN red mud. However, with\nregard to the main elements, sodium, followed by calcium, had higher\nextraction efficiency than lithium under the same conditions. Concentrated\nhydrochloric acid can dissolve iron, aluminum and even titanium from red mud,\nwhile dilute hydrochloric acid is too mild to remove sodium or calcium,\nresulting in huge gaps between lithium and other main metals like sodium and\ncalcium in the subsequent acetic acid leaching process.\n\nWhen 0.5 mol/L oxalic acid was used to neutralize the red mud prior to acetic\nacid leaching, the lithium leaching efficiencies were in the range of 42.41 to\n46.88 percent, close to that of calcium and much higher than those of other\nmain elements like sodium, aluminum, iron and magnesium. It can be concluded\nthat oxalic acid was effectively used to treat red mud in this study, as it is\nacidic enough for the removal of sodium and can precipitate calcium.\n\nThe findings are instructive for the subsequent recovery, separation and\npurification of lithium from red mud. The optimum conditions for the\nextraction of lithium from oxalic acid-neutralized HN red mud were found to be\nacetic acid concentration of 25 percent (v/v), temperature of 85 C and time of\n60 minutes.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe leaching behavior of lithium from HN red mud using acetic acid was found\nto be significantly dependent on the neutralization pretreatment.\nNeutralization using oxalic acid was effective in removing sodium and aluminum\nand realizing higher lithium leaching efficiency.\n\nFull-text paper:\n\nMining, Metallurgy & Exploration (2020) 37:443-451,\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/s42461-020-00181-1>\n\nTo read the full text of this paper (free for SME members), see the beginning\nof this section for step-by-step instructions.\n\nReferences\n\n1\\.

    "html": "<object class=\"mstar_text_entity\"><param name=\"mstar_entity_type\" value=\"Headnote\" /><param name=\"mstar_entity_inline\" value=\"Y\" /><div class=\"Headnote_content\">\n<p>Keywords: Lithium, Red mud, Leaching, Acetic acid, Oxalic acid</p>\n<p>Special Extended Abstract</p>\n<p>Red mud has been reported as a potential resource for lithium. To investigate the leaching behavior of lithium, a lithium-rich red mud was neutralized with hydrochloric or oxalic acid and then leached with acetic acid. When red mud was neutralized using dilute hydrochloric acid, about 58 to 60 percent of lithium was leached with 25 percent acetic acid at 95 C for 60 min, while more than 95 percent of sodium and 85 percent of calcium were dissolved in the leachate solution. When oxalic acid was used to neutralize red mud prior to acetic acid leaching, lower lithium leaching efficiencies of about 42 to 47 percent were observed. Nevertheless, these leaching efficiencies of lithium were close to that of calcium and much higher than those of sodium under the same conditions. In this study, 25 percent (v/v) of acetic acid at 85 C for 60 min was demonstrated to be the optimum conditions for lithium extraction from oxalic acid-neutralized red mud using acetic acid. The results are useful and of interest for lithium recovery and purification from red mud.</p>\n</div></object>\n\n<p>Background</p>\n<p>Bauxite residue, or red mud, is generated during the Bayer process of alumina recovery from bauxite ore. The chemical compositions of bauxite residues are associated with the alumina process and the raw bauxite ores. Broad ranges of content are reflected in the six to eight main components and more than 50 trace elements. Red mud can be regarded as a polymetallic raw material, or an artificial ore, and the recovery of trace valuable elements from red mud, including rare earth elements [1], scandium [2] and gallium [3], have been reported. Lithium resources are crucial raw materials, and red mud has been reported as a potential resource for lithium that is transformed from bauxite ore. Lithium-bearing clays are thought of as a kind of new lithium resource due to the large potential size. Clay minerals in Karst-type bauxite, which are the main host phases of lithium, account for high volumes. When alumina is extracted during the Bayer process, lithium is concentrated in the residue, with the amount of content depending on the raw ores. Knowing the leaching behavior of lithium from red mud will help with lithium recovery and purification for further processing.</p>\n<p>Method</p>\n<p>The red-mud sample used in this study was HN, a lower iron diaspore Bayer red mud obtained from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..henan\">Henan, China</location>, as described in previous literature [4]. HN is one of the typical bauxite residues generated in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..henan\">Henan</location> province, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, with lithium content of 224 pg/g. As reported previously [5], the main chemical composition of HN is, by weight percent: Al2O3 22.54, SiO2 19.70, Fe2O3 9.69, CaO 17.65, TiO2 6.82, Na2O 4.12, K2O 2.10 and MgO 1.44.</p>\n<p>Dilute hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid were used for HN red-mud neutralization treatment, producing hydrochloric acid-neutralized HN and oxalic acid-neutralized HN for subsequent acetic acid leaching. The leaching efficiency of a given element in this study was calculated, and effect parameters, including acetic acid concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time, were investigated.</p>\n<p>Results and discussion</p>\n<p>After neutralizing with hydrochloric or oxalic acid, a lithium-rich red mud was leached using acetic acid to investigate the leaching behavior of lithium. After neutralizing with dilute hydrochloric acid at 0.01 mol/L, 58.04 to 60.27 percent of lithium was leached using 25 percent acetic acid at 95 C for 60 minutes. In addition, more than 95 percent of sodium and 85 percent of calcium were dissolved in the leachate solution. The dilute hydrochloric acid used in this study only extracted 0.52 percent of lithium in the process of neutralization treatment. Therefore, a higher leaching efficiency of lithium was obtained with hydrochloric acidneutralized HN red mud. However, with regard to the main elements, sodium, followed by calcium, had higher extraction efficiency than lithium under the same conditions. Concentrated hydrochloric acid can dissolve iron, aluminum and even titanium from red mud, while dilute hydrochloric acid is too mild to remove sodium or calcium, resulting in huge gaps between lithium and other main metals like sodium and calcium in the subsequent acetic acid leaching process.</p>\n<p>When 0.5 mol/L oxalic acid was used to neutralize the red mud prior to acetic acid leaching, the lithium leaching efficiencies were in the range of 42.41 to 46.88 percent, close to that of calcium and much higher than those of other main elements like sodium, aluminum, iron and magnesium. It can be concluded that oxalic acid was effectively used to treat red mud in this study, as it is acidic enough for the removal of sodium and can precipitate calcium.</p>\n<p>The findings are instructive for the subsequent recovery, separation and purification of lithium from red mud. The optimum conditions for the extraction of lithium from oxalic acid-neutralized HN red mud were found to be acetic acid concentration of 25 percent (v/v), temperature of 85 C and time of 60 minutes.</p>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n<p>The leaching behavior of lithium from HN red mud using acetic acid was found to be significantly dependent on the neutralization pretreatment. Neutralization using oxalic acid was effective in removing sodium and aluminum and realizing higher lithium leaching efficiency.</p>\n\n<object class=\"mstar_text_entity\"><param name=\"mstar_entity_type\" value=\"Sidebar\" /><param name=\"mstar_entity_inline\" value=\"Y\" /><div class=\"Sidebar_content\">\n<p>Full-text paper:</p>\n<p>Mining, Metallurgy &amp; Exploration (2020) 37:443-451, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42461-020-00181-1\">https://doi.org/10.1007/s42461-020-00181-1</a></p>\n<p>To read the full text of this paper (free for SME members), see the beginning of this section for step-by-step instructions.</p>\n</div></object>\n<object class=\"mstar_text_entity\"><param name=\"mstar_entity_type\" value=\"References\" /><param name=\"mstar_entity_inline\" value=\"N\" /><div class=\"References_content\">\n<p>References</p>\n<p>1.
