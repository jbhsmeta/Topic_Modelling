    "text": "During these dark days in our world, people impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinue to lose hope in the full restoration of their previous lifestyles.\nThat seems especially true for those in the biofuels industry.\n\nTrade wars, market instability, and an unprecedented drop in demand for\nethanol add to the struggle, making this a storm unlike anything rural\ncommunities have experienced. Farmers and biofuels producers are at the brink,\nand half the industry is already offline. Tens of thousands of Wisconsin\nfamilies, and the rural economies they support, may never recover if\npolicymakers don't do their part to protect the people who feed and fuel\nAmerica - the very people necessary for the survival of us all.\n\nUnfortunately, the United States Department of Agriculture failed to provide\nsupport for the biofuels industry in its first $19 billion relief package.\nRural communities are resilient, but we cannot be overlooked -- there is too\nmuch at stake. Our products and services make up a crucial part the\ninfrastructure necessary for Americans to live safely and comfortably, and we\nare needed!\n\nOur leaders in Washington should work to ensure that the entire agricultural\nsupply chain has the support it needs to rebuild. They should also move\nquickly to restore stability around the Renewable Fuel Standard and lift\nregulatory barriers to new markets. Perhaps then we can help lead the way to\nthe great economic comeback that our country so desperately needs.\n\nKirk Leach\n\nJanesville",

That seems especially true for those in the biofuels industry.</p>\n<p>Trade wars, market instability, and an unprecedented drop in demand for ethanol add to the struggle, making this a storm unlike anything rural communities have experienced. Farmers and biofuels producers are at the brink, and half the industry is already offline. Tens of thousands of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> families, and the rural economies they support, may never recover if policymakers don't do their part to protect the people who feed and fuel America - the very people necessary for the survival of us all.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the <org>United States Department of Agriculture</org> failed to provide support for the biofuels industry in its first <money>$19 billion</money> relief package. Rural communities are resilient, but we cannot be overlooked -- there is too much at stake. Our products and services make up a crucial part the infrastructure necessary for Americans to live safely and comfortably, and we are needed!</p>\n\n<p>Our leaders in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington</location> should work to ensure that the entire agricultural supply chain has the support it needs to rebuild. They should also move quickly to restore stability around the Renewable Fuel Standard and lift regulatory barriers to new markets.
