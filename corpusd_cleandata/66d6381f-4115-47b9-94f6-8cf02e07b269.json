    "text": "Frankfort, KY: Kentucky Democratic Party has issued the following news\nrelease:\n\nRoughly a month after Daniel Cameron stood with controversial pastor Jeff\nFugate trying to score political points during a global pandemic, the church\nwhere Fugate is pastor has become a COVID-19 hotspot, the Herald-Leader\nreported.\n\nCameron stood on the Capitol steps with Fugate in late April and\nmisrepresented Gov. Andy Beshear's intentions when it came to his executive\norders banning large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. After\nrestarting in-person services in May, Fugate's church now has at least 17\nmembers of his church who have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nFugate is best known for having to apologize in 2014 for having a skit\ninvolving blackface. Fugate also told protestors at a rally that they should\nremove their masks instead of protect themselves. Roughly a week ago, the\nSupreme Court rejected Cameron's argument that orders banning large gatherings\nwere discrimination.\n\nIn a statement, Kentucky Democratic Party spokesperson Marisa McNee said\nDaniel Cameron has a responsibility to put public health and safety above\npolitical games.\n\n\"Daniel Cameron owes an apology to the public for having engaged in a charade\nthat is directly responsible for at least 17 people getting sick with Covid\n19. It's just shameful, and yet perfectly predictable. I sincerely hope Mr.\nFugate's congregants recover without any longstanding complications. It's time\nfor Attorney General Cameron to start putting the public -- not his Republican\ndonors and friends -- first.\"",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.frnkft\">Frankfort, KY</location>: <org>Kentucky Democratic Party</org> has issued the following\nnews release:</p>\n\n<p>Roughly a month after <person>Daniel Cameron</person> stood with controversial\npastor <person>Jeff Fugate</person> trying to score political points during a global\npandemic, the church where Fugate is pastor has become a COVID-19\nhotspot, the Herald-Leader reported.</p>\n\n<p>Cameron stood on the <org>Capitol</org> steps with Fugate in late April and\nmisrepresented Gov. <person>Andy Beshear's</person> intentions when it came to his\nexecutive orders banning large gatherings due to the coronavirus\npandemic. After restarting in-person services in May, Fugate's\nchurch now has at least 17 members of his church who have tested\npositive for COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>Fugate is best known for having to apologize in 2014 for having a\nskit involving blackface. Fugate also told protestors at a rally that\nthey should remove their masks instead of protect themselves. Roughly a\nweek ago, the Supreme Court rejected Cameron's argument that orders\nbanning large gatherings were discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, <org>Kentucky Democratic Party</org> spokesperson <person>Marisa McNee</person>\nsaid <person>Daniel Cameron</person> has a responsibility to put public health and safety\nabove political games.</p>\n\n<p>\"<person>Daniel Cameron</person> owes an apology to the public for having\nengaged in a charade that is directly responsible for at least 17 people\ngetting sick with Covid 19. It's just shameful, and yet perfectly\npredictable. I sincerely hope <person>Mr. Fugate's</person> congregants recover\nwithout any longstanding complications. It's time for Attorney\nGeneral Cameron to start putting the public -- not his Republican donors\nand friends -- first.\"</p>",
