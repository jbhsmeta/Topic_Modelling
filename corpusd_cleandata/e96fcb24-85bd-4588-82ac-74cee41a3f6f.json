    "text": "PHILADELPHIA \\- Hundreds of protesters spilled onto an interstate highway in\nthe heart of Philadelphia on Monday afternoon, leading police to fire non-\nlethal bullets and tear gas and halting traffic during the evening rush hour.\n\nThe crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin\nBridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs across\nthe Delaware River.\n\nSome climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police fired non-lethal\nbullets and tear gas canisters.\n\nMore than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to\nblock the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand thoroughfare leading from\ndowntown the city's imposing art museum.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier coverage is below. Please check\nback for updates.\n\nNational Guard vehicles bordered City Hall and other government buildings in\nPhiladelphia's downtown on Monday as an overnight curfew lifted following\nongoing protests over George Floyd's death that led to more than 400 weekend\narrests.\n\nPhiladelphia officials closed most services and business in the center city\nafter a second day of peaceful racial protests over Floyd's death in Minnesota\nlast week turned into another night of destruction in cities nationwide and\nled President Donald Trump to single out the city on a call with governors.\n\nAn overnight curfew will be in effect for a third night, starting at 6 p.m.\nMonday.\n\nFire crews battled blazes into the early morning, some that threatened whole\nblocks either through the spread of flames or collapses and disrupted subway\nservice. Crews responded to nearly 250 fire calls, a fire spokesperson\ntweeted.\n\nThe Ben Franklin Bridge and other roads into Philadelphia reopened, and public\ntransportation had restarted with some disruptions from damage. But transit\nofficials shut down all downtown bus, trolley and subway stops at noon Monday\nin anticipation of more protests planned throughout the afternoon.\n\nClosures also included city coronavirus testing sites downtown, though\nofficials said sites in other areas of the city are open.\n\nCurfews, barricades and police presence pushed many of the protests into\nneighborhoods away from downtown late Sunday - but not until more store\nwindows were broken along business corridors around City Hall and dozens of\narrests were made.\n\nAbout 50 National Guard members arrived early Monday and about 50 more were\nexpected soon, U.S. Attorney William McSwain said.\n\nMcSwain's office is investigating whether any crimes committed during the\nunrest would fall under his federal jurisdiction, he and U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey,\na Republican, said at a news conference.\n\nHe believes that some people from outside Philadelphia incited riots, he said,\nbut also that a lot of city residents participated in \"opportunistic looting,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"We are looking into who are the real agitators,\" he said.\n\nIn Lancaster, Pennsylvania, city officials said they identified about 15\npeople in a crowd of protesters over the weekend who were wearing tactical\ngear and carrying weapons. Police officials said at a news conference Monday\nthat they had evidence that white nationalists had infiltrated the rally,\nwhich had a few incidents of bottles of cayenne pepper and other projectiles\nthrown at police.\n\nProtests of smaller sizes were held in cities across Pennsylvania including\nChambersburg, Reading, Bethlehem, Erie and Pittsburgh over the weekend.\nSeveral incidents of rioting, vandalism or violence occurred during a handful\nof those gatherings, but those were eclipsed by the damage and arrests related\nto the rallies in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump mentioned Philadelphia \\- where destruction has been on par with that in\nsome other major cities - on a call with governors Monday.\n\n\"Philadelphia is a mess. Philadelphia, what happened there is horrible. And\nthat was on television. They're breaking into stores and nobody showed up to\neven stop them,\" Trump said.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney responded at a news conference Monday calling\nTrump \"a mess\" and saying he has not been helpful during the protests. Kenney\nalso said he wasn't prepared to speculate whether the protests and the\naftermath would change the city's plan to ease restrictions on businesses and\nother stay-at-home-orders by entering into the state's \"yellow phase\" of\ncoronavirus recovery Friday.\n\n\"I'm not saying no, but I'm not saying yes either,\" Kenney said.\n\nPeople ran into stores in northeast Philadelphia and emerged with merchandise\non Sunday. Police fired tear gas in predominantly Black west Philadelphia as\npeople broke into boarded storefronts, stole merchandise and damaged property,\nincluding a row of police vehicles.\n\nTelevision footage showed people smashing cruiser windows, rifling through the\nempty vehicles and pushing the cars into others.\n\nMeanwhile Monday, several protests and marches were taking place across the\ncity, with little to no incidents, officials said.\n\nNeighbors and residents gathered Monday morning along a business corridor on\nGermantown Avenue in northeast Philadelphia to clean up broken glass and other\ndebris.\n\nCity Councilwoman Jamie Gauthier, who represents parts of west and southwest\nPhiladelphia, tweeted that neighbors had showed up to help clean up the 52nd\nStreet corridor.\n\nA fire that broke out around 7:30 a.m. at a business in the Olney neighborhood\nwas quickly brought under control, Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said. It was\ntoo early to say what caused it, he said.\n\nA fire late Sunday that appeared to have started at a Rent-A-Center in the\nKensington neighborhood caused parts of several stores and apartment buildings\nto collapse, Thiel said. Buses replaced a stretch of elevated train line as\nfire crews worked near the tracks.\n\nThe flames at one point endangered the entire block, and even after the fire\nwas put out, the threat of collapses persisted, officials said.\n\nNo injuries were reported in any of the fires Sunday night or Monday morning,\nofficials said. Several firefighters had been hurt battling downtown fires\nSaturday.\n\nNearly two dozen police officers were injured over two nights, including one\nwho was hit by a fleeing vehicle and is hospitalized with broken ribs and a\nbroken arm, said John McNesby, president of a Philadelphia police union.\nPhiladelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said some of those officers\nhad acid burns, head injuries and other injuries.\n\nOutlaw said police made 429 arrests from Saturday to early Monday, but that\nnumber was expected to grow as additional arrests were processed. She\nexplained the difficulty of sending resources to many incident centers spread\nout throughout the city. Kenney said the city would normally get about 3,000\ncalls for police service, but had received about 18,000 on Sunday.\n\n\"We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,\" Outlaw\nsaid. \"Add the pent up anger and then you add technology... and the way we\nhave been doing crowd control will have to adapt.\"\n\nFloyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died last week after a Minneapolis police\nofficer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, even after he\nstopped moving and pleading for air.",

AP's earlier coverage is below. Please check back for updates.</p>\n\n<p><org>National Guard</org> vehicles bordered <location>City Hall</location> and other government buildings in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia's</location> downtown on Monday as an overnight curfew lifted following ongoing protests over <person>George Floyd's</person> death that led to more than 400 weekend arrests.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> officials closed most services and business in the center city after a second day of peaceful racial protests over Floyd's death in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location> last week turned into another night of destruction in cities nationwide and led President <person>Donald Trump</person> to single out the city on a call with governors.</p>\n\n<p>An overnight curfew will be in effect for a third night, starting at <chron>6 p.m. Monday</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Fire crews battled blazes into the early morning, some that threatened whole blocks either through the spread of flames or collapses and disrupted subway service. Crews responded to nearly 250 fire calls, a fire spokesperson tweeted.</p>\n\n<p><location>The Ben Franklin Bridge</location> and other roads into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> reopened, and public transportation had restarted with some disruptions from damage. But transit officials shut down all downtown bus, trolley and subway stops at noon Monday in anticipation of more protests planned throughout the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Closures also included city coronavirus testing sites downtown, though officials said sites in other areas of the city are open.</p>\n\n<p>Curfews, barricades and police presence pushed many of the protests into neighborhoods away from downtown late Sunday - but not until more store windows were broken along business corridors around <location>City Hall</location> and dozens of arrests were made.</p>\n\n<p>About 50 <org>National Guard</org> members arrived early Monday and about 50 more were expected soon, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Attorney <person>William McSwain</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>McSwain's office is investigating whether any crimes committed during the unrest would fall under his federal jurisdiction, he and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Sen. <person>Pat Toomey</person>, a Republican, said at a news conference.</p>\n\n<p>He believes that some people from outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> incited riots, he said, but also that a lot of city residents participated in \"opportunistic looting,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are looking into who are the real agitators,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lancas\">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</location>, city officials said they identified about 15 people in a crowd of protesters over the weekend who were wearing tactical gear and carrying weapons. Police officials said at a news conference Monday that they had evidence that white nationalists had infiltrated the rally, which had a few incidents of bottles of cayenne pepper and other projectiles thrown at police.</p>\n\n<p>Protests of smaller sizes were held in cities across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location> including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.chaurg\">Chambersburg</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.readin\">Reading</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.bethem\">Bethlehem</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.erie\">Erie</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.pittbr\">Pittsburgh</location> over the weekend. Several incidents of rioting, vandalism or violence occurred during a handful of those gatherings, but those were eclipsed by the damage and arrests related to the rallies in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Trump mentioned <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> - where destruction has been on par with that in some other major cities - on a call with governors Monday.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> is a mess. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>, what happened there is horrible. And that was on television. They're breaking into stores and nobody showed up to even stop them,\" Trump said.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> Mayor <person>Jim Kenney</person> responded at a news conference Monday calling Trump \"a mess\" and saying he has not been helpful during the protests. Kenney also said he wasn't prepared to speculate whether the protests and the aftermath would change the city's plan to ease restrictions on businesses and other stay-at-home-orders by entering into the state's \"yellow phase\" of coronavirus recovery Friday.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm not saying no, but I'm not saying yes either,\" Kenney said.</p>\n\n<p>People ran into stores in northeast <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> and emerged with merchandise on Sunday. Police fired tear gas in predominantly <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.black\">Black</location> west <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> as people broke into boarded storefronts, stole merchandise and damaged property, including a row of police vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Television footage showed people smashing cruiser windows, rifling through the empty vehicles and pushing the cars into others.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Monday, several protests and marches were taking place across the city, with little to no incidents, officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Neighbors and residents gathered Monday morning along a business corridor on <location>Germantown Avenue</location> in northeast <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> to clean up broken glass and other debris.</p>\n\n<p>City Councilwoman <person>Jamie Gauthier</person>, who represents parts of west and southwest <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>, tweeted that neighbors had showed up to help clean up the <location>52nd Street</location> corridor.</p>\n\n<p>A fire that broke out around <chron>7:30 a.m.</chron> at a business in the Olney neighborhood was quickly brought under control, Fire Commissioner <person>Adam Thiel</person> said. It was too early to say what caused it, he said.</p>\n\n<p>A fire late Sunday that appeared to have started at a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:RCII\">Rent-A-Center</org> in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.kenton\">Kensington</location> neighborhood caused parts of several stores and apartment buildings to collapse, Thiel said. Buses replaced a stretch of elevated train line as fire crews worked near the tracks.</p>\n\n<p>The flames at one point endangered the entire block, and even after the fire was put out, the threat of collapses persisted, officials said.</p>\n\n<p>No injuries were reported in any of the fires Sunday night or Monday morning, officials said. Several firefighters had been hurt battling downtown fires Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly two dozen police officers were injured over two nights, including one who was hit by a fleeing vehicle and is hospitalized with broken ribs and a broken arm, said <person>John McNesby</person>, president of a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> police union. <org>Philadelphia Police</org> Commissioner <person>Danielle Outlaw</person> said some of those officers had acid burns, head injuries and other injuries.</p>\n\n<p>Outlaw said police made 429 arrests from Saturday to early Monday, but that number was expected to grow as additional arrests were processed. She explained the difficulty of sending resources to many incident centers spread out throughout the city. Kenney said the city would normally get about 3,000 calls for police service, but had received about 18,000 on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,\" Outlaw said. \"Add the pent up anger and then you add technology... and the way we have been doing crowd control will have to adapt.\"</p>\n\n<p>Floyd, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.black\">Black</location> man in handcuffs, died last week after a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.</p>",
