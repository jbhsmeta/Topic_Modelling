    "text": "The \"Autonomous Trains Global Market Report 2020-30: COVID-19 Growth and\nChange\"\n\n    \n    \n     report has been added to   [ResearchAndMarkets.com](http://ResearchAndMarkets.com)'s\n\noffering.\n\nThis report provides the strategists, marketers and senior management with the\ncritical information they need to assess the global autonomous trains\nmarket.The global autonomous trains market is expected to decline from $8.33\n\nbillion in 2019 to $7.32 billion in 2020 at a compound annual growth\n\nrate (CAGR) of -12.16%. The decline is mainly due to the COVID-19\n\noutbreak that has led to restrictive containment measures involving\n\nsocial distancing and remote working, and the closure of industries and\n\nother commercial activities. The market is then expected to recover and\n\nreach $9.69 billion in 2023 at CAGR of 9.8%.Reasons to PurchaseGain a truly\nglobal perspective with the most comprehensive report available on this market\ncovering 12+ geographies. Understand how the market is being affected by the\ncoronavirus and how it is likely to emerge and grow as the impact of the virus\nabates. Create regional and country strategies on the basis of local data and\nanalysis. Identify growth segments for investment.Outperform competitors using\nforecast data and the drivers and trends shaping the market. Understand\ncustomers based on the latest market research findings. Benchmark performance\nagainst key competitors.Utilize the relationships between key data sets for\nsuperior strategizing.Suitable for supporting your internal and external\npresentations with reliable high quality data and analysisNorth America was\nthe largest region in the autonomous train market in 2019. Asia Pacific is\nexpected to be the fastest growing region in the forecast period.LIDAR and\nArtificial intelligence are increasingly being used in autonomous trains to\nimprove the performance of the trains. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)\nsystem measures speed of moving train and captures irregularities of the track\nand evaluates the rail track quality. It uses two pairs of lenses to capture\nspeed signals from both rails individually. The track speed, curvature, and\nlateral and vertical geometry variations on each side are determined.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to improve the performance of\nautomated metro lines by enabling predictive maintenance which helps to reduce\nthe incidents and assist operators to recover from incidents more quickly.\nControl Centre with visual and voice interactions during an incident is a\ntime-consuming process. AI also helps to reduce these interactions and allow\ntraffic controllers to focus on the core problem.High deployment and\noperational costs along with increased security concerns is expected to limit\nthe growth of autonomous train market. The capital costs of signalling and\ncontrol equipment are likely to be associated with maintenance costs,\noperational costs, and large capital investments. On the other side, the\ntransfer of data between a train's safety critical system, in particular, is a\npotential target for hackers. ATO (Automatic Train Operation) with its\ninterconnectivity with other systems has an increased threat, making it\npotentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As it transfers high resolution,\nreal-time train determination information between the waysides, the train and\nthe control center, it is essential to ensure this vital data remains\nsecure.Increased need for a safe, efficient, cheap, fast and reliable mode of\ntransportation is contributing to the growth of global autonomous train\nmarket. Rail is the safest mode of land transport and more attractive to the\ncustomer. It is also one of the fastest mode of transports, which moves on\nhigh speed lines that are expected to average up to 300 km/hour. The distance\nof 1000 Km can easily be reached within 5 to 7 hours.It offers much greater\nflexibility of the time, allowing train frequencies to be better matched to\ndemand at peak and off-peak times. This offers a much better service to\npotential passengers and increases the number of passengers. When it comes to\nthe fares, intra-modal competition among railway operators, and competition\namong railway suppliers will keep fares affordable even in countries with low\nper capita income. Increased safety and cheaper fares compared to other\ntransports drove the autonomous train market.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1\\. Executive Summary 2.

    "html": "<block>\n<p>The   \"Autonomous Trains Global Market Report 2020-30: COVID-19 Growth and Change\"</p>\n<pre> report has been added to   <a href=\"http://ResearchAndMarkets.com\">ResearchAndMarkets.com</a>'s</pre>\n<p> offering.  </p>\n<p>This report provides the strategists, marketers and senior management with the critical information they need to assess the global autonomous trains market.The global autonomous trains market is expected to decline from <money>$8.33</money> </p>\n<p>billion in 2019 to <money>$7.32 billion</money> in 2020 at a compound annual growth </p>\n<p>rate (CAGR) of -12.16%. The decline is mainly due to the COVID-19 </p>\n<p>outbreak that has led to restrictive containment measures involving </p>\n<p>social distancing and remote working, and the closure of industries and </p>\n<p>other commercial activities. The market is then expected to recover and </p>\n<p>reach <money>$9.69 billion</money> in 2023 at CAGR of 9.8%.Reasons to PurchaseGain a truly global perspective with the most comprehensive report available on this market covering 12+ geographies. Understand how the market is being affected by the coronavirus and how it is likely to emerge and grow as the impact of the virus abates. Create regional and country strategies on the basis of local data and analysis. Identify growth segments for investment.Outperform competitors using forecast data and the drivers and trends shaping the market. Understand customers based on the latest market research findings. Benchmark performance against key competitors.Utilize the relationships between key data sets for superior strategizing.Suitable for supporting your internal and external presentations with reliable high quality data and analysisNorth America was the largest region in the autonomous train market in 2019. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia Pacific</location> is expected to be the fastest growing region in the forecast period.LIDAR and Artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in autonomous trains to improve the performance of the trains. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system measures speed of moving train and captures irregularities of the track and evaluates the rail track quality. It uses two pairs of lenses to capture speed signals from both rails individually. The track speed, curvature, and lateral and vertical geometry variations on each side are determined. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to improve the performance of automated metro lines by enabling predictive maintenance which helps to reduce the incidents and assist operators to recover from incidents more quickly. Control Centre with visual and voice interactions during an incident is a time-consuming process. AI also helps to reduce these interactions and allow traffic controllers to focus on the core problem.High deployment and operational costs along with increased security concerns is expected to limit the growth of autonomous train market. The capital costs of signalling and control equipment are likely to be associated with maintenance costs, operational costs, and large capital investments. On the other side, the transfer of data between a train's safety critical system, in particular, is a potential target for hackers. ATO (Automatic Train Operation) with its interconnectivity with other systems has an increased threat, making it potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As it transfers high resolution, real-time train determination information between the waysides, the train and the control center, it is essential to ensure this vital data remains secure.Increased need for a safe, efficient, cheap, fast and reliable mode of transportation is contributing to the growth of global autonomous train market. Rail is the safest mode of land transport and more attractive to the customer. It is also one of the fastest mode of transports, which moves on high speed lines that are expected to average up to 300 km/hour. The distance of 1000 Km can easily be reached within 5 to 7 hours.It offers much greater flexibility of the time, allowing train frequencies to be better matched to demand at peak and off-peak times. This offers a much better service to potential passengers and increases the number of passengers. When it comes to the fares, intra-modal competition among railway operators, and competition among railway suppliers will keep fares affordable even in countries with low per capita income. Increased safety and cheaper fares compared to other transports drove the autonomous train market.    </p>\n<p>    Key Topics Covered:</p>\n<p>1. Executive Summary 2.
