    "text": "San Francisco officials said Thursday they're committed to taking a portion of\nthe Police Department's budget and redirecting it to the city's African\nAmerican community.\n\nMayor London Breed and Supervisor Shamann Walton announced the move jointly,\nsaying it is intended as a small reparation to the \"decades of disinvestment\nin the African American community\" exacted by city policies that have had a\ndisproportionate impact on black people.\n\nBut Breed also made clear in a statement that redirecting some police funds in\nthe city's upcoming budget was in part inspired by the recent killing of\nGeorge Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down by Minneapolis\npolice officers last week.\n\n\"While the events of the last week have been painful and traumatic for so many\nof us, they have brought forward the devastating impacts of police violence\nagainst African Americans in this country,\" Breed said. \"Reforms to any single\nsystem, such as the criminal justice system or the police department, must go\nhand-in-hand with closing the gaps and ending the disparities that we know\nexist.\n\n\"By bringing the community into the process of making these decisions, we can\nensure that those who have been voiceless in the past now have a seat at the\ntable as we make decisions that will impact their community.\"\n\nThe proposal, so far, is a broad gesture, with assurances only that a\n\"collaborative process\" between the black community and the city would inform\nhow much money is redirected from the police and where it would go. Who will\nbe involved in crafting the funding proposal is not yet known. Neither Breed\nnor Walton gave any indication of how much money might be involved or where it\nmight be directed.\n\nMatt Dorsey, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the agency would\ndefer to the mayor and Board of Supervisors and declined to comment.\n\nBreed for years has supported increases to police staffing, increasing foot\npatrols and building relationships between police and the communities were\nthey work. It is not known how this proposal might impact those initiatives.\n\nWalton is the District 10 supervisor who represents the historically African\nAmerican Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhoods.\n\n\"We have continued to see our organizations inequitably disregarded and\ndisproportionately left out of receipt of vital resources,\" he said. \"In these\ntimes of continued systemic and systematic oppression of black people, we have\nto be innovative and strong with our solutions.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Walton introduced a resolution urging the city's Civil\nService Commission, which sets the rules for city hiring processes, to create\na blanket ban on the hiring of any police or sheriff's deputy with a history\nof serious misconduct.\n\nHe has also committed to organizing a broad conversation about reparations for\nSan Francisco's black community, which has dwindled to 5% of the city's\npopulation. Black households in San Francisco earn just 28% of what white\nhouseholds earn, according to city data. Despite the enormous amounts of money\npassing through the city's economy, around 19% of black children live in\npoverty in San Francisco, and black people comprise 35% of the city's homeless\npopulation.\n\nDiscussions on how to redistribute money from the Police Department to the\nblack community will unfold against the backdrop of an unprecedented budget\ncrisis for San Francisco. By October, Breed, city departments and the Board of\nSupervisors must make painful cuts across the board to close a $1.7 billion\nbudget deficit over the next two years - a shortfall created by the\ncoronavirus pandemic.\n\n_Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> officials said Thursday they're committed to taking a portion of the <org>Police Department's</org> budget and redirecting it to the city's <org>African American</org> community.</p>\n<p>Mayor London Breed and Supervisor Shamann Walton announced the move jointly, saying it is intended as a small reparation to the \"decades of disinvestment in the <org>African American</org> community\" exacted by city policies that have had a disproportionate impact on black people.</p>\n<p>But Breed also made clear in a statement that redirecting some police funds in the city's upcoming budget was in part inspired by the recent killing of <person>George Floyd</person>, a black man who died after being pinned down by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officers last week.</p>\n<p>\"While the events of the last week have been painful and traumatic for so many of us, they have brought forward the devastating impacts of police violence against African Americans in this country,\" Breed said. \"Reforms to any single system, such as the criminal justice system or the police department, must go hand-in-hand with closing the gaps and ending the disparities that we know exist.</p>\n<p>\"By bringing the community into the process of making these decisions, we can ensure that those who have been voiceless in the past now have a seat at the table as we make decisions that will impact their community.\"</p>\n<p>The proposal, so far, is a broad gesture, with assurances only that a \"collaborative process\" between the black community and the city would inform how much money is redirected from the police and where it would go. Who will be involved in crafting the funding proposal is not yet known. Neither Breed nor Walton gave any indication of how much money might be involved or where it might be directed.</p>\n<p><person>Matt Dorsey</person>, a spokesman for the <org>Police Department</org>, said the agency would defer to the mayor and <org>Board of Supervisors</org> and declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Breed for years has supported increases to police staffing, increasing foot patrols and building relationships between police and the communities were they work. It is not known how this proposal might impact those initiatives.</p>\n<p>Walton is the <location>District 10</location> supervisor who represents the historically <location>African American Bayview-Hunters Point</location> neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>\"We have continued to see our organizations inequitably disregarded and disproportionately left out of receipt of vital resources,\" he said. \"In these times of continued systemic and systematic oppression of black people, we have to be innovative and strong with our solutions.\"</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Walton introduced a resolution urging the city's <org>Civil Service Commission</org>, which sets the rules for city hiring processes, to create a blanket ban on the hiring of any police or sheriff's deputy with a history of serious misconduct.</p>\n<p>He has also committed to organizing a broad conversation about reparations for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco's</location> black community, which has dwindled to 5% of the city's population. Black households in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location> earn just 28% of what white households earn, according to city data. Despite the enormous amounts of money passing through the city's economy, around 19% of black children live in poverty in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location>, and black people comprise 35% of the city's homeless population.</p>\n<p>Discussions on how to redistribute money from the <org>Police Department</org> to the black community will unfold against the backdrop of an unprecedented budget crisis for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location>. By October, Breed, city departments and the <org>Board of Supervisors</org> must make painful cuts across the board to close a <money>$1.7 billion</money> budget deficit over the next two years - a shortfall created by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p><em><person>Dominic Fracassa</person> is a <org>San Francisco Chronicle</org> staff writer.
