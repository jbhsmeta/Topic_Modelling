    "text": "When the team at PRS Guitars decided to proceed ahead with hosting their tenth\n\"Experience PRS\" virtually, they had no idea of the impact it would make. This\nyear's event was supposed to be held on May 8 and 9 and was expected to\nattract more than 3,500 attendees from all over the globe, including PRS\nartists, dealers and international distributors, customers and enthusiasts,\nand worldwide press for two days of music, education, factory tours, and fun\nat PRS Guitars in Stevensville, Maryland. The virtual Experience premiered on\nthe PRS YouTube channel on May 9 and accumulated over 25,000 views by the end\nof the weekend.\n\n\"As soon as we realized we would not be able to host Experience PRS this year,\nwe knew we wanted to find some way to still connect and celebrate with our\nextended PRS family. We ended up premiering these artist videos on YouTube so\nwe could have a 'live' feel and get to hang out in the comments with the\npresenting artists, customers, and fans,\" said Judy Schaefer, director of\nmarketing for PRS Guitars. \"There were lots of familiar people watching along\ntogether, and that feeling of community that is so palpable during our\nExperience events was present in a very real way. I couldn't be happier with\nthe outcome.\"\n\nThe virtual Experience event rolled out with two sessions of clinics featuring\nartist clinics from the same artists that would have been presenting on the\nExperience stages. The culminating piece of Experience PRS is always a concert\non the main stage. With that option not possible this year, the closing event\nfor Experience PRS 2020 was a special, star-studded video with Paul Reed Smith\nand several PRS artists and friends. The video, called \"Long Distance,\" was\nshot from a series of Zoom calls from Paul's home studio. The discussions that\nensued from the 14 artists that participated were both intimate, entertaining,\nand educational. The PRS marketing team edited 4.5-hours of call footage down\nto under a half hour for the video. The individual conversations will be\nreleased, in full, on an on-going basis starting this week.\n\n\"I'd like to thank all of our artists for being so gracious with their time\nand their craft. They are a huge part of Experience each year, and I am\nthrilled we were still able to share their clinics and stories in this unique\ntime,\" said Bev Fowler, director of Artist Relations for PRS Guitars.\n\nThe videos premiered live on PRS Guitars YouTube channel and will be available\nin perpetuity so fans can watch them anytime.

    "title": "PRS Guitars' Tenth 'Experience PRS 2020' Event a Virtual Success",
    "html": "<p>When the team at PRS Guitars decided to proceed ahead with hosting their tenth \"Experience PRS\" virtually, they had no idea of the impact it would make. This year's event was supposed to be held on <chron>May 8</chron> and 9 and was expected to attract more than 3,500 attendees from all over the globe, including PRS artists, dealers and international distributors, customers and enthusiasts, and worldwide press for two days of music, education, factory tours, and fun at PRS Guitars in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.stelle\">Stevensville, Maryland</location>. The virtual Experience premiered on the PRS YouTube channel on <chron>May 9</chron> and accumulated over 25,000 views by the end of the weekend.</p>\n<p>\"As soon as we realized we would not be able to host Experience PRS this year, we knew we wanted to find some way to still connect and celebrate with our extended PRS family. We ended up premiering these artist videos on YouTube so we could have a 'live' feel and get to hang out in the comments with the presenting artists, customers, and fans,\" said <person>Judy Schaefer</person>, director of marketing for PRS Guitars. \"There were lots of familiar people watching along together, and that feeling of community that is so palpable during our Experience events was present in a very real way. I couldn't be happier with the outcome.\"</p>\n<p>The virtual Experience event rolled out with two sessions of clinics featuring artist clinics from the same artists that would have been presenting on the Experience stages. The culminating piece of Experience PRS is always a concert on the main stage. With that option not possible this year, the closing event for Experience PRS 2020 was a special, star-studded video with <person>Paul Reed Smith</person> and several PRS artists and friends. The video, called \"Long Distance,\" was shot from a series of Zoom calls from Paul's home studio. The discussions that ensued from the 14 artists that participated were both intimate, entertaining, and educational. The PRS marketing team edited 4.5-hours of call footage down to under a half hour for the video. The individual conversations will be released, in full, on an on-going basis starting this week.</p>\n<p>\"I'd like to thank all of our artists for being so gracious with their time and their craft. They are a huge part of Experience each year, and I am thrilled we were still able to share their clinics and stories in this unique time,\" said <person>Bev Fowler</person>, director of Artist Relations for PRS Guitars.</p>\n<p>The videos premiered live on PRS Guitars YouTube channel and will be available in perpetuity so fans can watch them anytime.
