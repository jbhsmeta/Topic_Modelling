    "text": "The Trump administration is undermining laws against sex discrimination in\neducation with new rules that narrow the definition of sexual harassment in\npublic schools and colleges, California and other states charged in a lawsuit\nThursday.\n\nThe rules announced by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for school\nadministrators handling claims of harassment \"will reverse decades of effort\nto end the corrosive effects of sexual harassment on equal access to\neducation,\" lawyers for 17 states and the District of Columbia said in a\nfederal court filing in Washington, D.C.\n\nDeVos has argued that standards for harassment cases under President Barack\nObama's administration were too broad and unfair to the accused.\n\n\"Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and\npunishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes,\" she\nsaid in November.\n\nIn 2017, she announced guidelines that would make it harder for accusers to\nprove their claims and easier to defend against them. A lawsuit by women's\nrights organizations was dismissed in 2018 by a federal magistrate in San\nFrancisco, who said the guidelines were not legally binding and states that\nignored them would not lose federal funds.\n\nThe new rules, announced last month, are binding and enforceable by forfeiture\nof billions of dollars in federal education funds. They are due to take effect\nAug. 14 \\- far too soon, the states argued in their lawsuit, with campuses\nclosed because of the coronavirus, and virtually no time for consultation or\nreview.\n\nOne new rule says that unless an accuser is alleging sexual assault, she must\nshow that the alleged harassment is \"so severe, pervasive and objectively\noffensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the (school's)\neducation program.\" That standard, the states said, \"requires students to\nendure repeated and escalating levels of harassment\" before filing a\ncomplaint.\n\nUnder Obama administration standards, accusers could prove their claims by a\n\"preponderance of the evidence,\" showing they were more likely true than\nfalse. The new rules allow, though they do not require, schools to choose a\nmore-demanding standard, \"clear and convincing evidence.\"\n\nThe rules also bar some claims of harassment outside school grounds - for\nexample, the states said, at an off-campus apartment where the students lived.\nFormer students will no longer be allowed to file cases, \"even where the\nformer student left school because of the sexual harassment,\" the suit said.\n\nAnother change, applying only to colleges, will entitle the accused student to\nenlist an \"adviser\" to question the accuser at a hearing. DeVos said cross-\nexamination would make the proceedings fairer, while opponents said it would\ntraumatize and intimidate victims.\n\nThe suit asks a federal judge to block the new rules.\n\n\"From mocking the #MeToo movement to pushing this backward rule that makes our\nschools less safe, President Trump wears his disdain for gender equality and\nsafety on his sleeve,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a\nstatement accompanying the lawsuit.\n\n_Bob Egelko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

    "html": "<p>The Trump administration is undermining laws against sex discrimination in education with new rules that narrow the definition of sexual harassment in public schools and colleges, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> and other states charged in a lawsuit Thursday.</p>\n<p>The rules announced by Education Secretary <person>Betsy DeVos</person> for school administrators handling claims of harassment \"will reverse decades of effort to end the corrosive effects of sexual harassment on equal access to education,\" lawyers for 17 states and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.dc\">District of Columbia</location> said in a federal court filing in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, D.C.</location></p>\n<p>DeVos has argued that standards for harassment cases under President <person>Barack Obama's</person> administration were too broad and unfair to the accused.</p>\n<p>\"Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes,\" she said in November.</p>\n<p>In 2017, she announced guidelines that would make it harder for accusers to prove their claims and easier to defend against them. A lawsuit by women's rights organizations was dismissed in 2018 by a federal magistrate in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sanfrn\">San Francisco</location>, who said the guidelines were not legally binding and states that ignored them would not lose federal funds.</p>\n<p>The new rules, announced last month, are binding and enforceable by forfeiture of billions of dollars in federal education funds. They are due to take effect <chron>Aug. 14</chron> - far too soon, the states argued in their lawsuit, with campuses closed because of the coronavirus, and virtually no time for consultation or review.</p>\n<p>One new rule says that unless an accuser is alleging sexual assault, she must show that the alleged harassment is \"so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the (school's) education program.\" That standard, the states said, \"requires students to endure repeated and escalating levels of harassment\" before filing a complaint.</p>\n<p>Under Obama administration standards, accusers could prove their claims by a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" showing they were more likely true than false. The new rules allow, though they do not require, schools to choose a more-demanding standard, \"clear and convincing evidence.\"</p>\n<p>The rules also bar some claims of harassment outside school grounds - for example, the states said, at an off-campus apartment where the students lived. Former students will no longer be allowed to file cases, \"even where the former student left school because of the sexual harassment,\" the suit said.</p>\n<p>Another change, applying only to colleges, will entitle the accused student to enlist an \"adviser\" to question the accuser at a hearing. DeVos said cross-examination would make the proceedings fairer, while opponents said it would traumatize and intimidate victims.</p>\n<p>The suit asks a federal judge to block the new rules.</p>\n<p>\"From mocking the #MeToo movement to pushing this backward rule that makes our schools less safe, <person>President Trump</person> wears his disdain for gender equality and safety on his sleeve,\" <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> Attorney General <person>Xavier Becerra</person> said in a statement accompanying the lawsuit.</p>\n<p><em><person>Bob Egelko</person> is a <org>San Francisco Chronicle</org> staff writer.
