    "text": "Security suites group all your security requirements into a single Interface,\nmaking it much easier to keep your PCs safe online\n\nFree security tools are perfectly adequate if you don't mind configuring and\nmonitoring them yourself, and even Windows' built-in security software now\ndoes a decent job of keeping your PC free from malware. With a solid backup\nregime and a few key programs to protect and clean your computer, you're as\nsafe on the internet as ever.\n\nHowever, the level of maintenance involved isn't to everyone's liking and many\npeople prefer an all-encompassing security package to manage all their\nsecurity requirements in one place. For this, you need an internet security\nsuite.\n\nHOW WE TESTED\n\nOur test results draw on the work of two of the most respected\nantivirustesting organisations in the world: AV-Comparatives (www.av-\ncomparatives .org) and AV-Test (www [.av-test.org](http://.av-test.org)). Both\ncarry out extensive independent testing of security products and publish\nregular reports of protection scores, false positives and performance ratings.\n\nBitdefender Internet Security 2020 1 \u00a314.99 (1 year, 3 devices)\n\nBuy from Amazon: bit.ly/bitdef497\n\nFEATURES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 PERFORMANCE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 EASEOFUSE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 VALUEFORMONEY \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nBitdefender offers one of the most effective security suites around. Its AV-\nTest results achieved a perfect 100% score for malware protection and it\ndropped only a few marks in the AV-Comparatives' tests. While this doesn't\nquite match Norton 360's flawless record, Bitdefender did better than Norton\nin the false-positive tests. The suite is nimble, too, with a creditable 94%\nrating for system performance.\n\nBitdefender's suite has loads of options to play around with. The customisable\ndashboard provides access to a selection of core features, and the Protection\nand Privacy panes offer plenty more to explore. For example, the Protection\npane includes options for launching and configuring various types of scan, as\nwell as settings for web-based and behavioural protection. It's also where\nyou'll find the firewall, which runs quietly in the background, though you can\nalso set up your own rules and definitions. There's also a Vulnerability Scan\ntool that warns you about missing updates (for Windows and other software),\nand highlights weak passwords and insecure networks.\n\nBitdefender provides two modules to help fight ransomware: Safe Files blocks\nuntrusted apps from writing to selected folders, while Ransomware Remediation\nautomatically makes temporary backups of vulnerable files.\n\nWe were also impressed with the Rescue Environment, which avoids fiddly setup\non a DVD or USB stick and instead reserves a section of your hard drive. This\nmeans you can't lose it and, when you find yourself worried about your\nsecurity, allows you to reboot your system to launch a scan safely within\nseconds.\n\nWe found the parental controls to be the best in the group. Once you've added\nthe software to your children's devices, you can monitor and approve apps and\nwebsites, and enforce screen-time limits. The Android app lets you keep an eye\non their contacts and track their location, too.\n\nVERDICT\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nThis isasuperb security suite that's extremely effective and comes loaded with\ntools and features. However, it's also lightweight and easy to use. The price\nis very reasonable for new users but it's worth noting that you'll be put on a\nrecurring contract, so be sure to switch this off and check that the price\nisas good whenthe renewal date comes around the following year. If it isn't,\nshop aroundfor abetter option. The other suites in this round-up have their\nownstrengths but, asa one-stop all-rounder, Bitdefender can't be beaten.\n\nNorton 360 Deluxe 1 \u00a320.17 (1 year, 5 devices)\n\nBuy from Amazon: bit.ly/norton497\n\nFEATURES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 PERFORMANCE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEASEOFUSE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 VALUE FOR MONEY \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNorton's 360 suite is the only one here to include cloud backup, though this\nis aimed at essential files only, with a limited amount of storage - between\n10GB and 75GB, depending on the number of devices you install it on.\n\nThe suite also comes with a VPN (though this was disappointing compared to\nstandalone alternatives) and parental controls. Most of the other features are\nhidden away in a confusing interface - the firewall, for example, is buried in\nthe software's settings.\n\nNorton achieved a 100% success rate at blocking malware in the tests by both\nAV-Test and AV-Comparatives. You can't argue with that: it's a brilliant\nresult that none of the other tools managed. It wasn't quite so good at\navoiding false positives, however, and got caught out by blocking seven safe\nprograms across the two testing companies.\n\nVERDICT \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nNorton's excellent protection rating is its best asset but it also offers a\ncouple of attractive extras, including VPN and cloud backup. These aren't as\ngood as standalone tools but they are handy to have in the mix of your\nsecurity suite.\n\nKaspersky Internet Security 2020 1 \u00a323.89 (1 year,\n\n5 devices) I Buy from Amazon: bit.ly/kaspersky497\n\nFEATURES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 PERFORMANCE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nEASEOFUSE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605VALUE FOR MONEY \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nKaspersky caught all the malware thrown at it by AV-Test, but didn't fare\nquite so well with AV-Comparatives, where it blocked 99.6% of threats. That's\nstill impressive but it's the worst score of the four products reviewed here.\nWhere Kaspersky excelled was in avoiding false positives, achieving a clean\nsheet in tests from both organisations.\n\nThe suite includes plenty of extras, such as the Safe Money browser, which you\ncan use any time, not just when you're banking and buying; and the Network\nMonitor - a firewall that lets you control everything that accesses the\ninternet. Trusted Applications mode only allows you to run programs vetted and\napproved by Kaspersky, while the suite's cleaning and maintenance tools get\ninto your PC's nooks and crannies to clean non-standard settings and out-of-\ndate applications.\n\nVERDICT \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\nDespite its many tools and features, Kaspersky's performance rating of 96.8%\nmakes it the least draining of PC resources of the suites we tested. Shop\naround, though, because it's available from retailers for far less than\nKaspersky charges.\n\nMcAfee Total Protection 1 \u00a313.27 (1 year, 10 devices)\n\nBuy from Amazon: bit.ly/mcafee497\n\nFEATURES \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 PERFORMANCE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nEASEOFUSE \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606VALUE FOR MONEY \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nHaving parted ways with its former owner, Intel, McAfee has fixed its damaged\nreputation and now offers vastly improved protection at a very competitive\nprice.\n\nIronically, the version named Total Protection doesn't have as many features\nas its rivals - you get parental control but no backup or VPN options.\nHowever, the real meat of this product is in its virus scanner, Web Advisor\nbrowser extension (for Chrome and Firefox) and automatic software updater.\nThese tools helped McAfee stop 99.4% of the malware in the tests but while\nKaspersky fared worse in the AV-Comparatives test, Total Protection came last\nplace in AV-Test's. It also recorded six false positives with AV-Comparatives,\nbut scored a clean sheet with AV-Test. On the other hand, it did well in the\nperformance tests, with only Kaspersky having a lesser impact on the test PC's\noperating system.\n\nVERDICT \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMcAfee Total Protection isn't the most hawk-eyed security suite around and\nit's comparatively light on features. However, it's much better than it used\nto be, is very affordable and lightweight, and you can install it on twice as\nmany devices.\n\nOURVERDICT\n\nWe gave our Gold Award to Bitdefender Internet Security 2020 because it\nperformed well, and is brimming with useful features and protection options.\nAll this comes at a very affordable price, though it's still worth shopping\naround when it comes to renewal time.\n\nIf you don't mind paying a little more, you might consider plumping for Norton\n360 Deluxe instead. Its protection was excellent, earning it our Silver Award,\nand it comes with handy extras in the form of online backup and a VPN.\n\nOur Bronze Award winner is Kaspersky, which offered the lightest tool with the\nleast impact on the day-to-day running of the PC it's installed on. Its\nprotection isn't quite up to Bitdefender and Norton standards in the most\nrecent tests, but it was better at avoiding false positives. -",

With a solid backup regime and a few key programs to protect and clean your computer, you're as safe on the internet as ever.</p>\n<p>However, the level of maintenance involved isn't to everyone's liking and many people prefer an all-encompassing security package to manage all their security requirements in one place. For this, you need an internet security suite.</p>\n<p>HOW WE TESTED</p>\n<p>Our test results draw on the work of two of the most respected antivirustesting organisations in the world: AV-Comparatives (www.av-comparatives .org) and AV-Test (www <a href=\"http://.av-test.org\">.av-test.org</a>). Both carry out extensive independent testing of security products and publish regular reports of protection scores, false positives and performance ratings.</p>\n<p>Bitdefender Internet Security 2020 1 &#163;14.99 (1 year, 3 devices)</p>\n<p>Buy from Amazon: bit.ly/bitdef497</p>\n<p>FEATURES &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; PERFORMANCE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; EASEOFUSE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; VALUEFORMONEY &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>Bitdefender offers one of the most effective security suites around. Its AV-Test results achieved a perfect 100% score for malware protection and it dropped only a few marks in the AV-Comparatives' tests. While this doesn't quite match Norton 360's flawless record, Bitdefender did better than Norton in the false-positive tests. The suite is nimble, too, with a creditable 94% rating for system performance.</p>\n<p>Bitdefender's suite has loads of options to play around with. The customisable dashboard provides access to a selection of core features, and the Protection and Privacy panes offer plenty more to explore. For example, the Protection pane includes options for launching and configuring various types of scan, as well as settings for web-based and behavioural protection. It's also where you'll find the firewall, which runs quietly in the background, though you can also set up your own rules and definitions. There's also a Vulnerability Scan tool that warns you about missing updates (for Windows and other software), and highlights weak passwords and insecure networks.</p>\n<p>Bitdefender provides two modules to help fight ransomware: Safe Files blocks untrusted apps from writing to selected folders, while Ransomware Remediation automatically makes temporary backups of vulnerable files.</p>\n<p>We were also impressed with the Rescue Environment, which avoids fiddly setup on a DVD or USB stick and instead reserves a section of your hard drive. This means you can't lose it and, when you find yourself worried about your security, allows you to reboot your system to launch a scan safely within seconds.</p>\n<p>We found the parental controls to be the best in the group. Once you've added the software to your children's devices, you can monitor and approve apps and websites, and enforce screen-time limits. The Android app lets you keep an eye on their contacts and track their location, too.</p>\n<p>VERDICT</p>\n<p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>This isasuperb security suite that's extremely effective and comes loaded with tools and features. However, it's also lightweight and easy to use. The price is very reasonable for new users but it's worth noting that you'll be put on a recurring contract, so be sure to switch this off and check that the price isas good whenthe renewal date comes around the following year. If it isn't, shop aroundfor abetter option. The other suites in this round-up have their ownstrengths but, asa one-stop all-rounder, Bitdefender can't be beaten.</p>\n<p>Norton 360 Deluxe 1 &#163;20.17 (1 year, 5 devices)</p>\n<p>Buy from Amazon: bit.ly/norton497</p>\n<p>FEATURES &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; PERFORMANCE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>EASEOFUSE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734; VALUE FOR MONEY &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>Norton's 360 suite is the only one here to include cloud backup, though this is aimed at essential files only, with a limited amount of storage - between 10GB and 75GB, depending on the number of devices you install it on.</p>\n<p>The suite also comes with a VPN (though this was disappointing compared to standalone alternatives) and parental controls. Most of the other features are hidden away in a confusing interface - the firewall, for example, is buried in the software's settings.</p>\n<p>Norton achieved a 100% success rate at blocking malware in the tests by both AV-Test and AV-Comparatives. You can't argue with that: it's a brilliant result that none of the other tools managed. It wasn't quite so good at avoiding false positives, however, and got caught out by blocking seven safe programs across the two testing companies.</p>\n<p>VERDICT &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>\n<p>Norton's excellent protection rating is its best asset but it also offers a couple of attractive extras, including VPN and cloud backup. These aren't as good as standalone tools but they are handy to have in the mix of your security suite.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky Internet Security 2020 1 &#163;23.89 (1 year,</p>\n<p>5 devices) I Buy from Amazon: bit.ly/kaspersky497</p>\n<p>FEATURES &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; PERFORMANCE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>\n<p>EASEOFUSE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;VALUE FOR MONEY &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</p>\n<p>Kaspersky caught all the malware thrown at it by AV-Test, but didn't fare quite so well with AV-Comparatives, where it blocked 99.6% of threats. That's still impressive but it's the worst score of the four products reviewed here. Where Kaspersky excelled was in avoiding false positives, achieving a clean sheet in tests from both organisations.</p>\n<p>The suite includes plenty of extras, such as the Safe Money browser, which you can use any time, not just when you're banking and buying; and the Network Monitor - a firewall that lets you control everything that accesses the internet. Trusted Applications mode only allows you to run programs vetted and approved by Kaspersky, while the suite's cleaning and maintenance tools get into your PC's nooks and crannies to clean non-standard settings and out-of-date applications.</p>\n<p>VERDICT &#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</p>\n<p>Despite its many tools and features, Kaspersky's performance rating of 96.8% makes it the least draining of PC resources of the suites we tested. Shop around, though, because it's available from retailers for far less than Kaspersky charges.</p>\n<p>McAfee Total Protection 1 &#163;13.27 (1 year, 10 devices)</p>\n<p>Buy from Amazon: bit.ly/mcafee497</p>\n<p>FEATURES &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734; PERFORMANCE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</p>\n<p>EASEOFUSE &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;VALUE FOR MONEY &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>Having parted ways with its former owner, Intel, McAfee has fixed its damaged reputation and now offers vastly improved protection at a very competitive price.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the version named Total Protection doesn't have as many features as its rivals - you get parental control but no backup or VPN options. However, the real meat of this product is in its virus scanner, Web Advisor browser extension (for Chrome and Firefox) and automatic software updater. These tools helped McAfee stop 99.4% of the malware in the tests but while Kaspersky fared worse in the AV-Comparatives test, Total Protection came last place in AV-Test's. It also recorded six false positives with AV-Comparatives, but scored a clean sheet with AV-Test. On the other hand, it did well in the performance tests, with only Kaspersky having a lesser impact on the test PC's operating system.</p>\n<p>VERDICT &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>\n<p>McAfee Total Protection isn't the most hawk-eyed security suite around and it's comparatively light on features. However, it's much better than it used to be, is very affordable and lightweight, and you can install it on twice as many devices.</p>\n<p>OURVERDICT</p>\n<p>We gave our Gold Award to Bitdefender Internet Security 2020 because it performed well, and is brimming with useful features and protection options. All this comes at a very affordable price, though it's still worth shopping around when it comes to renewal time.</p>\n<p>If you don't mind paying a little more, you might consider plumping for Norton 360 Deluxe instead. Its protection was excellent, earning it our Silver Award, and it comes with handy extras in the form of online backup and a VPN.</p>\n<p>Our Bronze Award winner is Kaspersky, which offered the lightest tool with the least impact on the day-to-day running of the PC it's installed on. Its protection isn't quite up to Bitdefender and Norton standards in the most recent tests, but it was better at avoiding false positives. -</p>",
