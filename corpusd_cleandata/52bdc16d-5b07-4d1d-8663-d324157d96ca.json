    "text": "The National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) women's softball league announced it's\ncanceling the 2020 season due to COVID-19, but it looks forward to returning\nin 2021.\n\nThat means no softball in Rosemont for the Chicago Bandits in 2020, which was\nhard to hear for Bandits general manager Toni Calmeyn, though the announcement\nwasn't a huge surprise.\n\n\"It is painful,\" Calmeyn said. \"It's OK, we've been upfront and honest with\nour players all along. They've had all the information all along. We've had a\ncouple of Zoom meetings and said this is the situation and these are the\npossibilities. I think them [the team] having the information all along was\nreally helpful. I think when you don't know and wonder, it gets more stressful\nand it's already stressful as is right now.\"\n\nCalmeyn said keeping an open dialog helped the team a lot, so the news wasn't\ncoming out of left field. All the players and coaches knew this cancelation\ncould happen. Nobody wanted it, but they understand the reasoning.\n\n\"They know we did everything in our power to have a season,\" Calmeyn said.\n\"It's been disappointing, but it's OK. I can tell you my head coach and my\nplayers have been amazing. They are really supportive of the league, Rosemont\nand our decision. We had a really great group. No hard fall out.\"\n\nRosemont Mayor Brad Stephens knew of the situation all along, according to\nCalmeyn. Calmeyn said he was supportive of the village-owned team and the\nleague through the whole deal.\n\nNow the Bandits have to look forward, though the 2021 schedule is set to be a\ntough one as well. The Tokyo Olympics were moved from 2020 to 2021 (July\n23-Aug. 8).\n\nCalmeyn said it will be a non-traditional schedule again next year because of\nthe Olympics.\n\nThe league will discuss how it will go about things in 2021 to operate around\nthe Olympics, which take place during the regular season of the schedule.\nThree teams in the league are Olympic teams with Canada, Australia and Mexico\ncompeting.\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge, everyone will come back,\" Calmeyn said of the\n2021 teams. \"I think if everything is healthy and safe and all that, we'll\n[all] be back.\"\n\nOver the last few months, Canada and Australia dropped out as teams in the\n2020 season, but Calmeyn expects them back. They both dropped out because of\nCOVID-19. NPF also lost Beijing Eagles (China) and USSSA Pride (Florida) at\nthe end of the 2019 season. The teams that still remained for 2020 were\nChicago, Cleveland Comets (Mexico team) and debuting California Commotion.\nThose three teams along with the Aussie Peppers and Canadian Wild are expected\nto return in 2021.\n\nChicago will have to work on its roster over the coming year after signing a\nnumber of players recently to one-year contracts.\n\nIn recent months they signed Coley Ries, Ali Aguilar, Janie Reed, Michaela\nSchlattman, Amanda Chidester, Hannah Flippen, Andrea Filler and Aleshia\nOcasio.\n\n\"We are super fortunate that the players we sign want to be here,\" Calmeyn\nsaid. \"I am not worried about them leaving. Typically before the end of the\nseason they already start talking to us about when can we sign up for next\nyear.\"\n\nOne thing that's given some relief to Calmeyn is the sponsors the team has.\n\n\"They've all been great,\" Calmeyn said of the sponsors. \"They have all said\nlet us know when you are back and we will support you next year. That's really\nimportant that they don't go away and just stick with us. I think that they\nwill [stick around]. As unfortunate as things have been, it's been positive\nfrom the player front, the coaching front and the sponsorship front. It's been\nOK.\"\n\nWhile the wait will be longer, Calmeyn and the Bandits look forward to a\nchance to play again the game they love and help it grow for generations to\ncome.",

They've had all the information all along. We've had a couple of Zoom meetings and said this is the situation and these are the possibilities. I think them [the team] having the information all along was really helpful. I think when you don't know and wonder, it gets more stressful and it's already stressful as is right now.\"</p>\n\n<p>Calmeyn said keeping an open dialog helped the team a lot, so the news wasn't coming out of left field. All the players and coaches knew this cancelation could happen. Nobody wanted it, but they understand the reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>\"They know we did everything in our power to have a season,\" Calmeyn said. \"It's been disappointing, but it's OK. I can tell you my head coach and my players have been amazing. They are really supportive of the league, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.rosont\">Rosemont</location> and our decision. We had a really great group. No hard fall out.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.rosont\">Rosemont</location> Mayor <person>Brad Stephens</person> knew of the situation all along, according to Calmeyn. Calmeyn said he was supportive of the village-owned team and the league through the whole deal.</p>\n\n<p>Now the Bandits have to look forward, though the 2021 schedule is set to be a tough one as well. The <org>Tokyo Olympics</org> were moved from 2020 to 2021 (July 23-Aug. 8).</p>\n\n<p>Calmeyn said it will be a non-traditional schedule again next year because of the <org>Olympics</org>.</p>\n\n<p>The league will discuss how it will go about things in 2021 to operate around the <org>Olympics</org>, which take place during the regular season of the schedule. Three teams in the league are Olympic teams with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> competing.</p>\n\n<p>\"To the best of my knowledge, everyone will come back,\" Calmeyn said of the 2021 teams. \"I think if everything is healthy and safe and all that, we'll [all] be back.\"</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few months, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> dropped out as teams in the 2020 season, but Calmeyn expects them back. They both dropped out because of COVID-19. NPF also lost <person>Beijing Eagles</person> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>) and USSSA Pride (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>) at the end of the 2019 season. The teams that still remained for 2020 were <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>, Cleveland Comets (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> team) and debuting California Commotion. Those three teams along with the Aussie Peppers and Canadian Wild are expected to return in 2021.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location> will have to work on its roster over the coming year after signing a number of players recently to one-year contracts.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months they signed <person>Coley Ries</person>, <person>Ali Aguilar</person>, <person>Janie Reed</person>, <person>Michaela Schlattman</person>, <person>Amanda Chidester</person>, <person>Hannah Flippen</person>, <person>Andrea Filler</person> and <person>Aleshia Ocasio</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are super fortunate that the players we sign want to be here,\" Calmeyn said. \"I am not worried about them leaving. Typically before the end of the season they already start talking to us about when can we sign up for next year.\"</p>\n\n<p>One thing that's given some relief to Calmeyn is the sponsors the team has.</p>\n\n<p>\"They've all been great,\" Calmeyn said of the sponsors. \"They have all said let us know when you are back and we will support you next year. That's really important that they don't go away and just stick with us. I think that they will [stick around]. As unfortunate as things have been, it's been positive from the player front, the coaching front and the sponsorship front. It's been OK.\"</p>\n\n<p>While the wait will be longer, Calmeyn and the Bandits look forward to a chance to play again the game they love and help it grow for generations to come.</p>",
