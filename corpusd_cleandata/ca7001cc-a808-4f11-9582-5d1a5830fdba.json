Less\nthan two weeks later, donations had climbed past $5000. \"Every day, you all\nshow how much you care about our students, and just what lengths you are\nwilling to go,\" Bressler wrote in a follow-up email. The goal was raised to\n$10,000, with the Foundation matching every dollar donated up to $10,000. That\ngoal, too, was surpassed.\n\nSaid Bressler, \"It's just so heartwarming to know that despite the\ncircumstances we are all currently in, the Casper College family came together\nto help us to assist as many of our students in need that we can.\"\n\nFIB contributes to nonprofits\n\nIn an effort to help get food and resources into the hands of those who need\nit most during the COVID-19 health crisis, First Interstate Bank and its\nFoundation recently stepped up to donate a total of $20,000 to six separate\nWyoming nonprofits.\n\nDonation recipients include the Wyoming Food Bank of the Rockies, Wyoming Food\nfor Thought Project, Restoration Church Food Pantry, Holy Cross Food Bank,\nNatrona County Meals on Wheels and the Wyoming Rescue Mission.\n\nFurther, because First Interstate believes in stepping up during difficult\ntimes, the company has solidified its annual commitment to once again donate 2\npercent of its net income before taxes to nonprofits serving those in need\nacross First Interstate's six-state footprint.\n\nLast year, this totaled more than $5.2 million.\n\nTo provide relief to both individuals and businesses, First Interstate has\ncreated a number of programs to address multiple challenges arising in the\ncurrent climate.\n\nFirst Interstate currently has two separate initiatives underway with\ncommunity focus:\n\nFirst Interstate has partnered with EverFi, a leader in financial education\nprogramming, to develop online financial literacy modules that assist with\nplanning, teaching and learning. This content is available at First\nInterstate's online Resource Center.To ensure meals for families throughout\nits footprint, First Interstate has kicked off its annual Neighbors Feeding\nNeighbors program early. Launched in 2009 by the First Interstate Foundation,\nNeighbors Feeding Neighbors was created to focus resources on food insecurity,\none of the most pressing issues facing communities. During the third quarter\nof each year, the Foundation doubles its match of money and time donated by\nthe employees to charitable organizations that provide food to neighbors in\nneed. This year, First Interstate decided to start the outreach a quarter\nearlier to help neighbors when they need it most. They plan to keep this\ncampaign in place throughout 2020.",

Less than two weeks later, donations had climbed past <money>$5000</money>. \"Every day, you all show how much you care about our students, and just what lengths you are willing to go,\" Bressler wrote in a follow-up email. The goal was raised to <money>$10,000</money>, with the Foundation matching every dollar donated up to <money>$10,000</money>. That goal, too, was surpassed.</p>\n\n<p>Said Bressler, \"It's just so heartwarming to know that despite the circumstances we are all currently in, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2486620025\">Casper College</org> family came together to help us to assist as many of our students in need that we can.\"</p>\n\n<p>FIB contributes to nonprofits</p>\n\n<p>In an effort to help get food and resources into the hands of those who need it most during the COVID-19 health crisis, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3065288634\">First Interstate Bank</org> and its Foundation recently stepped up to donate a total of <money>$20,000</money> to six separate <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wy\">Wyoming</location> nonprofits.</p>\n\n<p>Donation recipients include the <org>Wyoming Food Bank of the Rockies</org>, Wyoming Food for <org>Thought Project</org>, Restoration Church Food Pantry, <org>Holy Cross Food Bank</org>, Natrona County Meals on Wheels and the <org>Wyoming Rescue Mission</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Further, because First Interstate believes in stepping up during difficult times, the company has solidified its annual commitment to once again donate 2 percent of its net income before taxes to nonprofits serving those in need across First Interstate's six-state footprint.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, this totaled more than <money>$5.2 million</money>.</p>\n\n<p>To provide relief to both individuals and businesses, First Interstate has created a number of programs to address multiple challenges arising in the current climate.</p>\n\n<p>First Interstate currently has two separate initiatives underway with community focus:</p>\n\n<p>First Interstate has partnered with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1702917727\">EverFi</org>, a leader in financial education programming, to develop online financial literacy modules that assist with planning, teaching and learning. This content is available at First Interstate's online Resource Center.To ensure meals for families throughout its footprint, First Interstate has kicked off its annual Neighbors Feeding Neighbors program early. Launched in 2009 by the <org>First Interstate Foundation</org>, Neighbors Feeding Neighbors was created to focus resources on food insecurity, one of the most pressing issues facing communities. During the third quarter of each year, the Foundation doubles its match of money and time donated by the employees to charitable organizations that provide food to neighbors in need. This year, First Interstate decided to start the outreach a quarter earlier to help neighbors when they need it most. They plan to keep this campaign in place throughout 2020.</p>",
