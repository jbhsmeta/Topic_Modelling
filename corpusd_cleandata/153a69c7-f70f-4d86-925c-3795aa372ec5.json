    "text": "Madison:Wisconsin Public Service Commission has issued the following document\n:\n\nWPL submits the following information as a part of its Application for a\nCertificate of Authority (Application) to acquire and operate six solar\nelectric generating facilities located in Wisconsin. One of those six\nfacilities is the North Rock Project (Project), an approximately 50-megawatt\nalternating current (MWAC) solar electric generation facility, which will be\nlocated in the Town of Fulton, Rock County, Wisconsin. North Rock Solar, LLC\n(North Rock), a wholly owned subsidiary of Geronimo Energy, LLC (Geronimo), is\ncurrently developing the Project, but WPL intends to acquire and operate the\nProject, subject to receipt of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin's\n(Commission) approval in this proceeding.\n\nTo aid the Commission and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource's (WDNR)\nreview and permitting of the Application, WPL has prepared this appendix,\nwhich provides an overview of the Project's environmental, community, land\nuse, and other site-specific impacts. The information included herein is based\non the guidance provided in the Commission's Draft Application Filing\nRequirements for Solar Energy Projects (Solar AFR). Some of the information\ncalled for in the Solar AFR (e.g., project need and economic analysis) is\npresented in the main body of WPL's Application, whereas other information is\nunavailable at this time.\n\nWPL has made its best efforts to provide the Commission with as much\ninformation as possible regarding this Project to facilitate the Commission's\nreview of the Application. However, construction is not scheduled to begin\nuntil July 2022 and the Project design is still preliminary in nature.\nAccordingly, the information presented in this appendix is based on\ninformation known to WPL at this time and is subject to change as Project\ndevelopment proceeds and the Project design is finalized.\n\n1\\. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW\n\n1.1 GENERAL PROJECT LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND PROJECT AREA\n\nThe proposed Project will be located in the Town of Fulton, Township 4N, Range\n12E, Section 17, Rock County, spanning multiple different parcels with\ndifferent property owners. The Project will be located in an area bounded by\nCounty Road M (to the south), Pomeroy Road (to the north), and Staff road (to\nthe west). North Rock possesses signed landowner agreements for the parcels on\nwhich the Project solar panels, substation, laydown yard, transformers,\njunction boxes, and collection system are currently proposed to be located.\nWPL has included a map of the project location within Appendix C-1 - Fig\n1.1.2, 4.1.1, and 4.1.2.\n\nThe Project will be interconnected to the high-voltage transmission grid\nthrough a generator tie-line located in Town of Fulton, Township 4N, Range\n12E, Sections 5, 8, and 9. The transmission line will consist of an\napproximately 1.5 mile, 69-kilovolt (kV) transmission line that will extend\nnorth from the Project and to American Transmission Company's (ATC) Sheepskin\n69 kV substation. North Rock has obtained easements for construction of the\ntransmission line, all of which will continue to be farmed.\n\nThere are currently lease options or transmission easement agreements for the\nProject\n\n2\n\nand the gen-tie line over parcels that contain approximately 907 acres of\nland. Based on the current Project design, WPL intends to lease and obtain\neasements over approximately 478 acres of land for the Project pursuant to\nthese agreements (Project Area). The Project facilities (i.e., arrays,\ninverters, collection system, substation, access roads, and gen-tie line) will\noccupy approximately 458 acres of land. Refer to Table 1 for additional\ninformation regarding the scope of the Project.\n\n1.2 OWNERSHIP\n\nProject ownership is addressed in Section V of the Application.\n\n1.3 PROJECT NEED/PURPOSE\n\nThe need for and economic analysis supporting the Project is addressed in\nSection IV of the Application.\n\n1.4 ALTERNATIVES\n\n1.4.1 Supply Alternatives\n\nAn analysis of Project alternatives is addressed in Section IV of the\nApplication.\n\n1.4.2 Project Area Selection\n\nAs mentioned, North Rock, a wholly owned subsidiary of Geronimo, is currently\ndeveloping the Project. North Rock identified the area for the Project based\non availability of suitable land, interconnection suitability, minimal\nenvironmental impacts, and the surrounding community, as discussed in greater\ndetail below:\n\n* Land Availability and Infrastructure: Large tracts of undeveloped lands are typically utilized for utility-scale solar facilities. The Project Area is mostly agricultural land that has been cultivated for grain. The Project Area is also adjacent to nearby roads and highways--such as County Road (CR) M and U.S. Route (US) 14--that are suitable for equipment and material delivery during construction.\n\n* Interconnection Suitability: One primary factor in site selection for utility-scale solar development is availably of existing electric infrastructure necessary to connect a project to the power grid. Preferred injection points are found where the existing electrical infrastructure is robust, thereby minimizing the interconnection facility costs and network upgrades frequently attributed to new generating facilities. Projects where land is available near points of interconnection are prioritized.\n\nPrior to submitting an interconnection request into the Midcontinent\nIndependent System Operator (MISO) queue, North Rock evaluated existing\ntransmission facilities in\n\n3\n\nthe area for available capacity and stability for a utility-scale solar\nproject. It was determined that the Sheepskin 69-kV substation would have\ncapacity for a solar project of at least 50 MW without triggering significant\ncostly upgrades. On March 8, 2018, North Rock submitted an interconnection\nrequest to MISO to interconnect into the Sheepskin 69 kV substation. The North\nRock Solar Project was given MISO queue number J1188. Additional details\nregarding the Project's interconnection status are provided in Section 2.5,\nbelow.\n\n* Environmental Considerations: A preliminary analysis was completed to screen for environmental factors including, but not limited to, wetlands, waterways, endangered species, critical habitat, floodplain, and cultural and historic resources. The land on which the Project will be located has few environmental constraints and those factors identified can be avoided by placement of the solar photovoltaic (PV) array.\n\n* Community: It is preferable to site solar projects in communities that welcome those projects and where landowners are interested in hosting solar facilities. The Town of Fulton and Rock County have expressed positive feedback about the Project.\n\n1.5 SITE SELECTION\n\nRefer to Section 1.4 above for a discussion of the individual factors and\ncharacteristics used to select the site on which the Project is being\ndeveloped. Table 1 depicts the status of all easement and lease agreements\nnecessary for construction and operation of the Project. WPL has also included\nmaps of land ownership within and around the project area in Appendix C-1 -\nFig 4.1.6.2.\n\nTable 1: Status of Easement, Lease, and Purchase Option Agreements\n\nPrimary owner name\n\nParcel ID\n\nType\n\nStatus\n\nGross Parcel Acreage\n\nRichard Linsley & Jeanene Linsley\n\n6-6-278\n\n6-6-276\n\nLease Option Agreement\n\nParticipating\n\n222.7\n\nWilliam Pratt\n\n6-6-283\n\n6-6-279\n\nLease Option Agreement\n\nParticipating\n\n254.55\n\nRodney Amundson & Judith Amundson\n\n6-6-55\n\nTransmission Easement Agreement\n\nParticipating\n\n154.4\n\nDuane Nelson & Donna Nelson\n\n6-6-48\n\nTransmission Easement Agreement\n\nParticipating\n\n80\n\nSayre Joint Farms, LLC\n\n6-6-64\n\nTransmission Easement Agreement\n\nParticipating\n\n61.65\n\nRoger Tofsland\n\n6-6-47\n\nTransmission\n\nParticipating\n\n53\n\n4\n\nIrrevocable Trust dated Jan 30, 2012\n\nEasement Agreement\n\nHoward & Floyd Wileman Farms, Inc.\n\n6-6-66\n\nTransmission Easement Agreement\n\nParticipating\n\n81.27\n\nThe Project is designed to maintain certain minimum setbacks from residences,\nproperty lines, and other features. The Project does not require easements\nfrom nonparticipating landowners to accommodate the setbacks utilized and no\ngood neighbor agreements have been executed or are anticipated to be required\nat this time. The Project is designed to meet the applicable setback\nrequirements under county and township ordinances or rules, as shown in Table\n2.\n\nTable 2: Design Setbacks\n\nSetback Description\n\nExpected Setback Distances\n\nResidences\n\n100-foot setback from solar components as measured to edge of panel.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION, PROJECT AREA, PANEL AND PANEL SITES, AND ANCILLARY\nFACILITIES\n\n2.1 ESTIMATED SOLAR RESOURCE AND PROJECTED ENERGY PRODUCTION\n\nTo evaluate the solar energy resource for the Project, 12 months of estimated\nmeteorological data was used. This data was developed utilizing the NREL NSRDB\nTyp. Met. Year PSMv3 - 2018 TMY meteo data file collected from Station ID\n844313. This data was then supplemented with 23 years of derived satellite\ndata to fill in any gaps and complete a Model Output Statistic corrected\nTypical Meteorological Year. This solar irradiance and climate information was\nthen used to simulate a typical full year of production with the photovoltaic\nsystems software (\"PVSYST\") analysis program.\n\nTable 4: Monthly and Annual Typical Solar Irradiance\n\nGlobal Horizontal irradiance (GHI) on PV Plane (kWh/m2)\n\nJan\n\nFeb\n\nMar\n\nApr\n\nMay\n\nJun\n\nJul\n\nAug\n\nSep\n\nOct\n\nNov\n\nDec\n\nYear\n\n44.1\n\n63.1\n\n123.0\n\n147.2\n\n173.0\n\n182.1\n\n189.3\n\n166.8\n\n130.2\n\n84.9\n\n57.1\n\n45.6\n\n1406.4\n\nWhile the maximum output of the solar farm will be 50 MWAC at the point of\nconnection, its output may be less at any given time depending on the energy\navailable from the sun.1 The software program PVSYST was used to simulate the\nenergy conversion process using model files from the PV module and inverter\nmanufacturer, historical weather data discussed above, and the parameters that\napply to the solar farm. The net capacity factor for the Project is calculated\nto be between 23 and 25 percent, when comparing the nameplate rating (50 MWAC)\nto the energy forecasted from the PVSYST model.\n\nThe estimated net annual energy production is between approximately 99,000 and\n105,000 megawatt hours (MWh). Actual annual energy production output will\ndepend on final design, site specific features, and annual variability in the\nsolar resource. Energy losses within the system include electrical losses in\nthe AC and direct current (DC) electrical collector system, energy conversion\nlosses within the PV inverters, step-up transformers and various other\nequipment, as well as losses due to soiling of the PV modules themselves due\nto dust, debris and snow cover. Taking those factors into account, a\nreasonable estimate of energy losses range from 15 to 20 percent of the\nmaximum output, which is consistent with industry-wide estimates.",

    "html": "<p>Madison:<org>Wisconsin Public Service Commission</org> has issued the\nfollowing document :</p>\n\n<p>WPL submits the following information as a part of its Application\nfor a Certificate of Authority (Application) to acquire and operate six\nsolar electric generating facilities located in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location>. One of those\nsix facilities is the <org>North Rock Project</org> (Project), an approximately\n50-megawatt alternating current (MWAC) solar electric generation\nfacility, which will be located in the Town of Fulton, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">Rock County,\nWisconsin</location>. <org>North Rock Solar, LLC</org> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location>), a wholly owned subsidiary\nof <org>Geronimo Energy, LLC</org> (Geronimo), is currently developing the Project,\nbut WPL intends to acquire and operate the Project, subject to receipt\nof the <org>Public Service Commission of Wisconsin's</org> (Commission)\napproval in this proceeding.</p>\n\n<p>To aid the Commission and <org>Wisconsin Department of Natural\nResource's</org> (WDNR) review and permitting of the Application, WPL has\nprepared this appendix, which provides an overview of the Project's\nenvironmental, community, land use, and other site-specific impacts. The\ninformation included herein is based on the guidance provided in the\nCommission's Draft Application Filing Requirements for Solar Energy\nProjects (Solar AFR). Some of the information called for in the Solar\nAFR (e.g., project need and economic analysis) is presented in the main\nbody of WPL's Application, whereas other information is unavailable\nat this time.</p>\n\n<p>WPL has made its best efforts to provide the Commission with as\nmuch information as possible regarding this Project to facilitate the\nCommission's review of the Application. However, construction is\nnot scheduled to begin until <chron>July 2022</chron> and the Project design is still\npreliminary in nature. Accordingly, the information presented in this\nappendix is based on information known to WPL at this time and is\nsubject to change as Project development proceeds and the Project design\nis finalized.</p>\n\n<p>1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW</p>\n\n<p>1.1 GENERAL PROJECT LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND PROJECT\nAREA</p>\n\n<p>The proposed Project will be located in the Town of Fulton,\nTownship 4N, Range 12E, Section 17, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">Rock County</location>, spanning multiple\ndifferent parcels with different property owners. The Project will be\nlocated in an area bounded by County Road M (to the south), <location>Pomeroy Road</location>\n(to the north), and Staff road (to the west). <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location> possesses\nsigned landowner agreements for the parcels on which the Project solar\npanels, substation, laydown yard, transformers, junction boxes, and\ncollection system are currently proposed to be located. WPL has included\na map of the project location within Appendix C-1 - Fig 1.1.2, 4.1.1,\nand 4.1.2.</p>\n\n<p>The Project will be interconnected to the high-voltage transmission\ngrid through a generator tie-line located in Town of Fulton, Township\n4N, Range 12E, Sections 5, 8, and 9. The transmission line will consist\nof an approximately 1.5 mile, 69-kilovolt (kV) transmission line that\nwill extend north from the Project and to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1965083055\">American Transmission\nCompany's</org> (ATC) Sheepskin 69 kV substation. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location> has obtained\neasements for construction of the transmission line, all of which will\ncontinue to be farmed.</p>\n\n<p>There are currently lease options or transmission easement\nagreements for the Project</p>\n\n<p>2</p>\n\n<p>and the gen-tie line over parcels that contain approximately 907\nacres of land. Based on the current Project design, WPL intends to lease\nand obtain easements over approximately 478 acres of land for the\nProject pursuant to these agreements (Project Area). The Project\nfacilities (i.e., arrays, inverters, collection system, substation,\naccess roads, and gen-tie line) will occupy approximately 458 acres of\nland. Refer to Table 1 for additional information regarding the scope of\nthe Project.</p>\n\n<p>1.2 OWNERSHIP</p>\n\n<p>Project ownership is addressed in Section V of the Application.</p>\n\n<p>1.3 PROJECT NEED/PURPOSE</p>\n\n<p>The need for and economic analysis supporting the Project is\naddressed in Section IV of the Application.</p>\n\n<p>1.4 ALTERNATIVES</p>\n\n<p>1.4.1 Supply Alternatives</p>\n\n<p>An analysis of Project alternatives is addressed in Section IV of\nthe Application.</p>\n\n<p>1.4.2 Project Area Selection</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location>, a wholly owned subsidiary of Geronimo, is\ncurrently developing the Project. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location> identified the area for the\nProject based on availability of suitable land, interconnection\nsuitability, minimal environmental impacts, and the surrounding\ncommunity, as discussed in greater detail below:</p>\n\n<p>* Land Availability and Infrastructure: Large tracts of undeveloped\nlands are typically utilized for utility-scale solar facilities. The\nProject Area is mostly agricultural land that has been cultivated for\ngrain. The Project Area is also adjacent to nearby roads and\nhighways--such as <location>County Road</location> (CR) M and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Route (US) 14--that are\nsuitable for equipment and material delivery during construction.</p>\n\n<p>* Interconnection Suitability: One primary factor in site selection\nfor utility-scale solar development is availably of existing electric\ninfrastructure necessary to connect a project to the power grid.\nPreferred injection points are found where the existing electrical\ninfrastructure is robust, thereby minimizing the interconnection\nfacility costs and network upgrades frequently attributed to new\ngenerating facilities. Projects where land is available near points of\ninterconnection are prioritized.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to submitting an interconnection request into the\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0008673623\">Midcontinent Independent System Operator</org> (MISO) queue, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location>\nevaluated existing transmission facilities in</p>\n\n<p>3</p>\n\n<p>the area for available capacity and stability for a utility-scale\nsolar project. It was determined that the Sheepskin 69-kV substation\nwould have capacity for a solar project of at least 50 MW without\ntriggering significant costly upgrades. On <chron>March 8, 2018</chron>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">North Rock</location>\nsubmitted an interconnection request to MISO to interconnect into the\nSheepskin 69 kV substation. <org>The North Rock Solar Project</org> was given MISO\nqueue number J1188. Additional details regarding the Project's\ninterconnection status are provided in Section 2.5, below.</p>\n\n<p>* Environmental Considerations: A preliminary analysis was\ncompleted to screen for environmental factors including, but not limited\nto, wetlands, waterways, endangered species, critical habitat,\nfloodplain, and cultural and historic resources. The land on which the\nProject will be located has few environmental constraints and those\nfactors identified can be avoided by placement of the solar photovoltaic\n(PV) array.</p>\n\n<p>* Community: It is preferable to site solar projects in communities\nthat welcome those projects and where landowners are interested in\nhosting solar facilities. The Town of Fulton and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.rock\">Rock County</location> have\nexpressed positive feedback about the Project.</p>\n\n<p>1.5 SITE SELECTION</p>\n\n<p>Refer to Section 1.4 above for a discussion of the individual\nfactors and characteristics used to select the site on which the Project\nis being developed. Table 1 depicts the status of all easement and lease\nagreements necessary for construction and operation of the Project. WPL\nhas also included maps of land ownership within and around the project\narea in Appendix C-1 - Fig 4.1.6.2.</p>\n\n<p>Table 1: Status of Easement, Lease, and Purchase Option Agreements</p>\n\n<p>Primary owner name</p>\n\n<p>Parcel ID</p>\n\n<p>Type</p>\n\n<p>Status</p>\n\n<p>Gross Parcel Acreage</p>\n\n<p><person>Richard Linsley</person> &amp; <person>Jeanene Linsley</person></p>\n\n<p>6-6-278</p>\n\n<p>6-6-276</p>\n\n<p>Lease Option Agreement</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>222.7</p>\n\n<p><person>William Pratt</person></p>\n\n<p>6-6-283</p>\n\n<p>6-6-279</p>\n\n<p>Lease Option Agreement</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>254.55</p>\n\n<p><person>Rodney Amundson</person> &amp; <person>Judith Amundson</person></p>\n\n<p><chron>6-6-55</chron></p>\n\n<p>Transmission Easement Agreement</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>154.4</p>\n\n<p><person>Duane Nelson</person> &amp; <person>Donna Nelson</person></p>\n\n<p><chron>6-6-48</chron></p>\n\n<p>Transmission Easement Agreement</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>80</p>\n\n<p><org>Sayre Joint Farms, LLC</org></p>\n\n<p><chron>6-6-64</chron></p>\n\n<p>Transmission Easement Agreement</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>61.65</p>\n\n<p><person>Roger Tofsland</person></p>\n\n<p><chron>6-6-47</chron></p>\n\n<p>Transmission</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>53</p>\n\n<p>4</p>\n\n<p><org>Irrevocable Trust</org> dated <chron>Jan 30, 2012</chron></p>\n\n<p>Easement Agreement</p>\n\n<p><org>Howard &amp; Floyd Wileman Farms, Inc.</org></p>\n\n<p><chron>6-6-66</chron></p>\n\n<p>Transmission Easement Agreement</p>\n\n<p>Participating</p>\n\n<p>81.27</p>\n\n<p>The Project is designed to maintain certain minimum setbacks from\nresidences, property lines, and other features. The Project does not\nrequire easements from nonparticipating landowners to accommodate the\nsetbacks utilized and no good neighbor agreements have been executed or\nare anticipated to be required at this time.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION, PROJECT AREA, PANEL AND PANEL SITES, AND\nANCILLARY FACILITIES</p>\n\n<p>2.1 ESTIMATED SOLAR RESOURCE AND PROJECTED ENERGY PRODUCTION</p>\n\n<p>To evaluate the solar energy resource for the Project, 12 months of\nestimated meteorological data was used. This data was developed\nutilizing the NREL NSRDB Typ. Met. Year PSMv3 - 2018 TMY meteo data file\ncollected from Station ID 844313. This data was then supplemented with\n23 years of derived satellite data to fill in any gaps and complete a\nModel Output Statistic corrected Typical Meteorological Year. This solar\nirradiance and climate information was then used to simulate a typical\nfull year of production with the photovoltaic systems software\n(\"PVSYST\") analysis program.</p>\n\n<p>Table 4: Monthly and Annual Typical Solar Irradiance</p>\n\n<p>Global Horizontal irradiance (GHI) on PV Plane (kWh/m2)</p>\n\n<p>Jan</p>\n\n<p>Feb</p>\n\n<p>Mar</p>\n\n<p>Apr</p>\n\n<p>May</p>\n\n<p>Jun</p>\n\n<p>Jul</p>\n\n<p>Aug</p>\n\n<p>Sep</p>\n\n<p>Oct</p>\n\n<p>Nov</p>\n\n<p>Dec</p>\n\n<p>Year</p>\n\n<p>44.1</p>\n\n<p>63.1</p>\n\n<p>123.0</p>\n\n<p>147.2</p>\n\n<p>173.0</p>\n\n<p>182.1</p>\n\n<p>189.3</p>\n\n<p>166.8</p>\n\n<p>130.2</p>\n\n<p>84.9</p>\n\n<p>57.1</p>\n\n<p>45.6</p>\n\n<p>1406.4</p>\n\n<p>While the maximum output of the solar farm will be 50 MWAC at the\npoint of connection, its output may be less at any given time depending\non the energy available from the sun.1 The software program PVSYST was\nused to simulate the energy conversion process using model files from\nthe PV module and inverter manufacturer, historical weather data\ndiscussed above, and the parameters that apply to the solar farm. The\nnet capacity factor for the Project is calculated to be between 23 and\n25 percent, when comparing the nameplate rating (50 MWAC) to the energy\nforecasted from the PVSYST model.</p>\n\n<p>The estimated net annual energy production is between approximately\n99,000 and 105,000 megawatt hours (MWh). Actual annual energy production\noutput will depend on final design, site specific features, and annual\nvariability in the solar resource. Energy losses within the system\ninclude electrical losses in the AC and direct current (DC) electrical\ncollector system, energy conversion losses within the PV inverters,\nstep-up transformers and various other equipment, as well as losses due\nto soiling of the PV modules themselves due to dust, debris and snow\ncover. Taking those factors into account, a reasonable estimate of\nenergy losses range from 15 to 20 percent of the maximum output, which\nis consistent with industry-wide estimates.</p>",
