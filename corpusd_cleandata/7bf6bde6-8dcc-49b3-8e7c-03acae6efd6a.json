    "text": "CLEMSON, S.C. \u0096 Clemson football and men's and women's basketball student-\nathletes are set to return to voluntary activity beginning June 8. The move\ncomes as Clemson University announced its phased return plan last week,\nincluding the NCAA's decision to permit voluntary activity for all sports.\n\nStudent-athletes may return back to the Clemson area as early as June 1 while\nundergoing a period of social and physical distancing \u0096 seven days at home\nprior to return to the area, and seven days in the Clemson area.\n\nOnce this period is complete without symptoms, the student-athletes are\neligible to begin pre-participation physicals with Clemson Sports Medicine.\nThis physical includes a test for COVID-19, as well as an antibody test.\nStudent-athletes must also complete a daily screening before entering\nfacilities.\n\n\"We are encouraged to begin the first step in the implementation of our Phase\nI planning, and appreciate the leadership of our University in helping us\nprepare for our student-athletes and staff to return in early June,\" said\nDirector of Athletics Dan Radakovich. \"We are confident in our ability to\nprovide a safe environment and have put our energy into that goal. We're\nencouraged by the progress and remain vigilant as we begin to welcome a\nlimited number of student-athletes back to our facilities.\"\n\nClemson Athletics has planned a three-phase approach to return, with oversight\nfrom the University, as well as guidance from local and national health\nofficials and best practices. The first phase is expected to commence in\nconjunction with Clemson University's previously-announced Phase I target\ndate.\n\nAll phases include guidelines for social distancing, face coverings, enhanced\nsanitization, limited groups, modified use of space and other safety measures.\nIn addition to the overarching plan, the department has worked at a granular\nlevel with coaching and support staffs, looking at each facility and\ndeveloping guidelines for those individual spaces. The plans are subject to\nchange based on guidance from the CDC, DHEC, State of South Carolina, Clemson\nUniversity, the NCAA or the ACC or new medical information and research.\n\nPhase I includes just those staff members directly responsible for the health\nand well-being of student-athletes, as well as those preparing facilities for\nPhase II. Sport coaches are expected to work remotely for Phase I, which will\nlast no fewer than 14 days. Coaches may begin activity within facilities in\nlimited numbers and employing recommended protocols with objective-based\nduties no sooner than Phase II.\n\nPhase II and Phase III each further integrate staffs and student-athletes, and\nmake adjustments to capacities and group settings, as well as facility access.\nClemson will continue to evaluate policies and procedures on spacing, contact\ntracing, testing, and other safety measures as more is known from the CDC,\nDHEC, ACC, NCAA or other medical research or guidance. Details regarding fall\ncompetition are not available at this time.\n\nCourtesy \u0096 Clemson Athletics",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.cleson\">CLEMSON, S.C.</location> &#150; Clemson football and men's and women's basketball student-athletes are set to return to voluntary activity beginning <chron>June 8</chron>. The move comes as <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4082499933\">Clemson University</org> announced its phased return plan last week, including the <org>NCAA's</org> decision to permit voluntary activity for all sports.</p>\n<p>Student-athletes may return back to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.cleson\">Clemson</location> area as early as <chron>June 1</chron> while undergoing a period of social and physical distancing &#150; seven days at home prior to return to the area, and seven days in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.sc.cleson\">Clemson</location> area.</p>\n\n<p>Once this period is complete without symptoms, the student-athletes are eligible to begin pre-participation physicals with Clemson Sports Medicine. This physical includes a test for COVID-19, as well as an antibody test. Student-athletes must also complete a daily screening before entering facilities.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are encouraged to begin the first step in the implementation of our Phase I planning, and appreciate the leadership of our University in helping us prepare for our student-athletes and staff to return in early June,\" said Director of Athletics <person>Dan Radakovich</person>. \"We are confident in our ability to provide a safe environment and have put our energy into that goal. We're encouraged by the progress and remain vigilant as we begin to welcome a limited number of student-athletes back to our facilities.\"</p>\n\n<p>Clemson Athletics has planned a three-phase approach to return, with oversight from the University, as well as guidance from local and national health officials and best practices. The first phase is expected to commence in conjunction with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4082499933\">Clemson University's</org> previously-announced Phase I target date.</p>\n\n<p>All phases include guidelines for social distancing, face coverings, enhanced sanitization, limited groups, modified use of space and other safety measures. In addition to the overarching plan, the department has worked at a granular level with coaching and support staffs, looking at each facility and developing guidelines for those individual spaces. The plans are subject to change based on guidance from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">CDC</org>, DHEC, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.sc\">State of South Carolina</location>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4082499933\">Clemson University</org>, the <org>NCAA</org> or the ACC or new medical information and research.</p>\n\n<p>Phase I includes just those staff members directly responsible for the health and well-being of student-athletes, as well as those preparing facilities for Phase II. Sport coaches are expected to work remotely for Phase I, which will last no fewer than 14 days. Coaches may begin activity within facilities in limited numbers and employing recommended protocols with objective-based duties no sooner than Phase II.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II and Phase III each further integrate staffs and student-athletes, and make adjustments to capacities and group settings, as well as facility access. Clemson will continue to evaluate policies and procedures on spacing, contact tracing, testing, and other safety measures as more is known from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">CDC</org>, DHEC, ACC, <org>NCAA</org> or other medical research or guidance. Details regarding fall competition are not available at this time.</p>\n\n<p>Courtesy &#150; Clemson Athletics</p>",
