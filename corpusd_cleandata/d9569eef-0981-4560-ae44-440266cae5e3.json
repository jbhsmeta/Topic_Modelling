    "text": "First, NASCAR returned to the track. Even without fans, it whet the appetite\nof racing fans in the midst of a sports-less world.\n\nThe action comes even closer to home on Saturday, as the Lawton Speedway is\nopen for the first time this season.\n\nBut unlike NASCAR, fans will be allowed, even though the stands are only\nallowed to be filled at 50-percent capacity.\n\nGates open at 4 p.m. and races start at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe racing season for Lawton Speedway was supposed to start on March 21. There\nhad already had a practice session. But soon after, the speedway - along with\nmost of the world - had to shut down.\n\nSpeedway promoter Marcy Davis said she got the green light to reopen from the\nCity of Lawton last Tuesday, and said the plan was to start back up last\nweekend before weather interfered. Finally, this Saturday, engines will roar\nonce again. And Davis said the drivers are more than ready, as she has\nreceived calls from drivers from Nebraska, Arkansas and all corners of Texas\nhungry for the opportunity to race.\n\n\"All these guys have been getting ready all winter,\" Davis said. \"They're just\ndying to get out there to race.\"\n\nOf course, there it won't exactly be business as usual, with only half the\nnumber of tickets available. Davis said she doesn't necessarily expect it to\nbe an issue, stating that at 50-percent occupancy, about 2,600 people could\nsit in the front spectator grandstands alone.\n\n\"There's plenty of room if we space out,\" Davis said. \"And that's all we can\ndo is ask them to do that. There's no law on it.\"\n\nGuests will also be asked to follow standard social distancing guidelines and\nprocedures, with bleacher grandstand seating limited to every other row.\nGuests will be asked to sit with their \"family groups\" and distance their\ngroups at least 6 feet from adjacent groups. Reserve seating area will be\nlimited to every other row with two empty seats between family groups. Wearing\nfacial covering is recommended.\n\nThe protocol isn't limited to the crowd, as race teams will be required to\nspace out in pit area, with no one allowed in the pit other than those that\ncame with the team.\n\nFor more information, call the Lawton Speedway at 355-6417.",

    "html": "<p>First, <org>NASCAR</org> returned to the track. Even without fans, it whet the appetite of racing fans in the midst of a sports-less world.</p>\n<p>The action comes even closer to home on Saturday, as the <org>Lawton Speedway</org> is open for the first time this season.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike <org>NASCAR</org>, fans will be allowed, even though the stands are only allowed to be filled at 50-percent capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Gates open at <chron>4 p.m.</chron> and races start at <chron>7:30 p.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>The racing season for <org>Lawton Speedway</org> was supposed to start on <chron>March 21</chron>. There had already had a practice session. But soon after, the speedway - along with most of the world - had to shut down.</p>\n\n<p>Speedway promoter <person>Marcy Davis</person> said she got the green light to reopen from the City of Lawton last Tuesday, and said the plan was to start back up last weekend before weather interfered. Finally, this Saturday, engines will roar once again. And Davis said the drivers are more than ready, as she has received calls from drivers from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ne\">Nebraska</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ar\">Arkansas</location> and all corners of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> hungry for the opportunity to race.</p>\n\n<p>\"All these guys have been getting ready all winter,\" Davis said. \"They're just dying to get out there to race.\"</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there it won't exactly be business as usual, with only half the number of tickets available. Davis said she doesn't necessarily expect it to be an issue, stating that at 50-percent occupancy, about 2,600 people could sit in the front spectator grandstands alone.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's plenty of room if we space out,\" Davis said. \"And that's all we can do is ask them to do that. There's no law on it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Guests will also be asked to follow standard social distancing guidelines and procedures, with bleacher grandstand seating limited to every other row. Guests will be asked to sit with their \"family groups\" and distance their groups at least 6 feet from adjacent groups. Reserve seating area will be limited to every other row with two empty seats between family groups. Wearing facial covering is recommended.</p>\n\n<p>The protocol isn't limited to the crowd, as race teams will be required to space out in pit area, with no one allowed in the pit other than those that came with the team.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, call the <org>Lawton Speedway</org> at 355-6417.</p>",
