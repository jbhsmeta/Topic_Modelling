    "text": "Boise: College of Idaho has issued the following news release:\n\nThe NAIA announced its plans for sports to return this fall and is targeting\nSeptember for a return to competition, according to a letter signed Thursday\nby NAIA President and CEO Jim Carr and NAIA Council of Presidents chairperson\nArvid Johnson.\n\nUnder the plan, all fall sports sponsored by the Cascade Conference \\-\nmen's/women's soccer, men's/women's golf, m/w cross-country, volleyball -\nwould be allowed to hold competitions starting Sept. 5. Football, which is\nsponsored by the Frontier Conference, will begin play Sept. 12.\n\nThis change will affect the current fall schedules for all College of Idaho\nteams - as a total of 17 events (four men's soccer games, four women's soccer\ngames, eight volleyball games and the football opener at Rocky Mountain) will\neither be rescheduled or canceled due to the new NAIA protocol.\n\n\"We are appreciative of the NAIA's decision in regards to the upcoming fall\nathletic season,\" said C of I athletic director, Reagan Rossi. \"This allows\nthe College, along with both the Cascade and Frontier Conferences nearly three\nfull months to plan for a safe and healthy return for our student-athletes\nthis fall.\"\n\nThe practice start date for all sports will be Aug. 15, though conditioning\nactivities and workouts that don't fall under the NAIA's definition of\n\"practice\" may begin before then in accordance with local and state\nguidelines. The plan will require football teams to practice for at least four\nweeks and all others for at least three before contests can begin.\n\nThe return-to-play dates are contingent on a threshold system, however, that\nwas approved by the Council of Presidents Executive Committee. As stated in\nthe letter, \"the threshold goal is for about half the participating\ninstitutions in each sport to receive clearance from local authorities to\nreturn to competition before the season can begin.\"\n\nThe delayed starts and institutions' desires to limit expenses will also mean\nreductions in the number of maximum regular-season contests allowed per sport:\nseven meets for cross country (down from eight), nine games for football (down\nfrom 11), 14 games for soccer (down from 18), and 22 dates for volleyball\n(down from 28).\n\n\"The rationale behind the selection of these dates is to provide an adequate\nacclimatization, conditioning and practice period prior to competition for\neach sport, while minimizing the need for student-athletes to return to campus\nearly,\" the letter states. \"Establishing start dates also creates a more level\nplaying field for all institutions that are able to compete this fall.\"\n\nFor now, the NAIA intends to hold all fall national championships as currently\nscheduled.\n\nThe national office and COP Executive Committee are continuing to explore\noptions for health and safety protocols, including testing and screening, and\nwill announce related decisions as they are made. The committee will be\nmeeting weekly throughout the month.\n\n\"Obviously we cannot predict what will happen in the next six months, but we\nare optimistic that the championships will be hosted as planned,\" the letter\nsays.\n\nBoth the CCC and the Frontier Conference will work in the coming weeks to\ndetermine potential changes to the 2020 schedules - with those changes to be\nposted at [YoteAthletics.com](http://YoteAthletics.com) once finalized.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.boise\">Boise</location>: <org>College of Idaho</org> has issued the following news release:</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000486343\">NAIA</org> announced its plans for sports to return this fall and is\ntargeting September for a return to competition, according to a letter\nsigned Thursday by <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000486343\">NAIA</org> President and CEO <person>Jim Carr</person> and <org>NAIA Council of\nPresidents</org> chairperson <person>Arvid Johnson</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Under the plan, all fall sports sponsored by the <org>Cascade Conference</org>\n- men's/women's soccer, men's/women's golf, m/w\ncross-country, volleyball - would be allowed to hold competitions\nstarting <chron>Sept. 5</chron>. Football, which is sponsored by the <org>Frontier\nConference</org>, will begin play <chron>Sept. 12</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>This change will affect the current fall schedules for all <org>College\nof Idaho</org> teams - as a total of 17 events (four men's soccer games,\nfour women's soccer games, eight volleyball games and the football\nopener at <location>Rocky Mountain</location>) will either be rescheduled or canceled due to\nthe new <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000486343\">NAIA</org> protocol.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are appreciative of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000486343\">NAIA's</org> decision in regards to\nthe upcoming fall athletic season,\" said C of I athletic director,\n<person>Reagan Rossi</person>. \"This allows the College, along with both the Cascade\nand Frontier Conferences nearly three full months to plan for a safe and\nhealthy return for our student-athletes this fall.\"</p>\n\n<p>The practice start date for all sports will be <chron>Aug. 15</chron>, though\nconditioning activities and workouts that don't fall under the\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000486343\">NAIA's</org> definition of \"practice\" may begin before then in\naccordance with local and state guidelines. The plan will require\nfootball teams to practice for at least four weeks and all others for at\nleast three before contests can begin.</p>\n\n<p>The return-to-play dates are contingent on a threshold system,\nhowever, that was approved by the <org>Council of Presidents Executive\nCommittee</org>. As stated in the letter, \"the threshold goal is for\nabout half the participating institutions in each sport to receive\nclearance from local authorities to return to competition before the\nseason can begin.\"</p>\n\n<p>The delayed starts and institutions' desires to limit expenses\nwill also mean reductions in the number of maximum regular-season\ncontests allowed per sport: seven meets for cross country (down from\neight), nine games for football (down from 11), 14 games for soccer\n(down from 18), and 22 dates for volleyball (down from 28).</p>\n\n<p>\"The rationale behind the selection of these dates is to\nprovide an adequate acclimatization, conditioning and practice period\nprior to competition for each sport, while minimizing the need for\nstudent-athletes to return to campus early,\" the letter states.\n\"Establishing start dates also creates a more level playing field\nfor all institutions that are able to compete this fall.\"</p>\n\n<p>For now, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000486343\">NAIA</org> intends to hold all fall national championships\nas currently scheduled.</p>\n\n<p>The national office and COP Executive Committee are continuing to\nexplore options for health and safety protocols, including testing and\nscreening, and will announce related decisions as they are made. The\ncommittee will be meeting weekly throughout the month.</p>\n\n<p>\"Obviously we cannot predict what will happen in the next six\nmonths, but we are optimistic that the championships will be hosted as\nplanned,\" the letter says.</p>\n\n<p>Both the CCC and the <org>Frontier Conference</org> will work in the coming\nweeks to determine potential changes to the 2020 schedules - with those\nchanges to be posted at <a href=\"http://YoteAthletics.com\">YoteAthletics.com</a> once finalized.</p>",
