Also, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, another\nreserve crew has been formed, which is made up of Anton Shkaplerov and Andrei\nBabkin.\n\nIt was reported earlier this month that Novitsky, Dubrov, Kud-Sverchkov, and\nRyzhikov had arrived in the United States to train for the ISS flight.\n\nThe Soyuz MS-17 was scheduled to launch in October 2020. Roscosmos executive\ndirector for manned missions Sergei Krikalyov said that for the first time in\n20 years, the crew was to be made up of only Russians. However, later, because\nthe U.S. manned spaceships were not ready, NASA asked Roscosmos for additional\nseats on Soyuz spaceships.\n\nInitially, the main crew of the Soyuz MS-17 was to include Anatoly Ivanishin\nand Ivan Vagner, but they were sent to the ISS on board Soyuz MS-16, instead\nof the main crew's Andrei Babkin and Nikolai Tikhonov, who were barred from\nthe flight for medical reasons.\n\nSpace and Rocket Building\n\nCoronavirus prompts Roscosmos to set up 3rd crew in addition to main, backup\ncrews for flight to ISS set for Oct\n\nMOSCOW.

June 1 (Interfax) - The Russian state space corporation Roscosmos has\nwelcomed Saturday's successful launch of the manned aircraft Crew Dragon in\nthe U.S. and noted the importance of a co-existence of two transport systems\nthat can deliver crews to the International Space Station.\n\n\"It is very important to have at least two opportunities to get to the\nstation. Since you never know... Things have happened in space, and there\nshould be at least two transport systems capable of ensuring the presence of\ncrews from different countries on board the ISS,\" Roscosmos spokesman Vladimir\nUstimenko wrote on Twitter.\n\nCommenting on the successful launch of Crew Dragon, Ustimenko said, \"What has\nhappened should have happened a long time ago. Now not only the Russians but\nalso the Americans will fly to the ISS. That's great!\"\n\nAs reported earlier, a SpaceX capsule carrying two NASA astronauts docked at\nthe ISS at 5:16 p.m. Moscow time on Sunday.\n\nCrew Dragon, on board of which two NASA astronauts, Robert Behnken and Douglas\nHurley, departed from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Saturday afternoon to reach\nthe ISS in about 19 hours, is the first manned aircraft launched form the U.S.\nsince 2011, when the final space shuttle mission was completed.\n\nThe two U.S. astronauts lifted off in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on a\nFalcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A in Florida at 3:22 p.m. EDT on May 30.\nInitially, the launch was due earlier on May 27 but ended up being delayed 15\nminutes to blast-off due to bad weather.\n\nThe launch was performed under the contract between NASA and SpaceX on\ncreating an aircraft and a launch vehicle for commercial manned missions to\nthe ISS.\n\nThis Crew Dragon mission is the spaceship's last big trial before a NASA\ncertification for regular commercial manned missions to the ISS. In March\n2019, a similar pilotless spacecraft completed the first successful\nexperimental spaceflight to the station.\n\nSince 2011, U.S. astronauts had been using Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to reach\nthe ISS. NASA pays Russia for seats on board a Soyuz spacecraft. In\nparticular, This May, NASA agreed to pay Roscosmos $90.2 million for one seat\non board the Soyuz, which is due to depart for the ISS on October.\n\nRoscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said on May 25 that Russia was following with\ninterest preparations for the launch of the manned spacecraft Crew Dragon to\nthe ISS. The return of Americans to this work will help increase the number of\nRussian cosmonauts on board the station, he said.\n\n\"It is with great interest that we're watching the preparations for this\nlaunch. We have several motives for this. Indeed, for the past nine years,\nsince summer 2011, only Russia, only Roscosmos, has facilitated the delivery\nof all international crews to the ISS: Americans, Europeans, the Japanese, and\nCanadians,\" Rogozin said on the Komsomolskaya Pravda radio station.\n\n\"Yes, we have, of course, made some money on that, but in fact, the\nresponsibility associated with supporting this transport system, the continual\ndelivery to the ISS, has been colossal; it's not worth the money: the cost is\nnerves, the health of the people in charge of manned space,\" Rogozin said.\n\n\"We would be very happy if the Americans came up with an alternative manned\ntransport system. It's a natural process, such a great power as the U.S., I\nimagine what they went through all these nine years, not being able to deliver\nastronauts to the ISS on their spacecraft [...] Let's wish them professional\nsuccess,\" he said.\n\nRussia is also interested in the technical side of the project, Rogozin said.\n\nUnburdening Russian spacecraft will help increase the number of cosmonauts on\nthe station, he said. \"We've reduced our crews to two cosmonauts, who are in\norbit continually. Sometimes there was only one, the captain, in orbit. This\nis wrong. This hinders the entire scientific program which we associate with\nthe ISS,\" Rogozin said.\n\nSpace and Rocket Building\n\nRogozin congratulates NASA, SpaceX on Crew Dragon's successful space journey,\nhopes for further cooperation\n\nMOSCOW. June 1 (Interfax) - Russia is hoping for further space cooperation\nwith the United States, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said.\n\n\"Dear Jim Bridenstine, it's safe to congratulate you at this point with a\nsuccessful launch and docking. Bravo! I know how anxious you were for this\nmajor event to become a success. I wish NASA team to successfully finish up\nreconstructing its national space transportation system,\" Rogozin wrote on\nTwitter.\n\n\"Please convey my sincere greetings to Elon Musk (I loved his joke) and SpaceX\nteam. Looking forward to further cooperation!\" the Roscosmos head wrote in\nEnglish.\n\nThe launch of the Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket was carried\nout from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on\nSaturday.\n\nThe Crew Dragon, which delivered NASA astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert\nBehnken into orbit for an experimental spaceflight to the International Space\nStation (ISS), became the first U.S. manned spacecraft, which has been\nlaunched from the territory of the U.S. since 2011, when the country\nterminated its space shuttle program.

It will be exciting!\" Ustimenko tweeted.\n\nUstimenko did not, however, say what particular rockets he meant.\n\nOn May 27, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said that the second test launch of\nthe Angara heavy-lift rocket might take place this fall and preparations for\nthe new strategic missile Sarmat's flight tests were up and running.\n\n\"This year we will give the heavy-lift Angara [rocket] to the test site for\nlaunching, for flight tests. We are resuming the tests of this heavy rocket,\nwhich was almost fine-tuned. I think that we will carry out flight tests of\nthis rocket this fall,\" Rogozin said on the Soloviev Live channel on YouTube.\n\nTests of the Angara rocket are expected to be completed by 2022, Rogozin said.\n\"We are switching to serial production in 2023,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking about the work on the new Russian-made strategic missile Sarmat,\nRogozin said that preparations for its flight trials were proceeding as\nplanned.\n\n\"We are systematically and consistently carrying out the tests of a new\nstrategic combat missile system. I hope that we will begin its flight tests as\nscheduled by the president. I refer to the Sarmat system.
