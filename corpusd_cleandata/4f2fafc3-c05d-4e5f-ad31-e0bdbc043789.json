    "text": "Following reports of senior citizens facing difficulty in their movement under\nthe general community quarantine, Senator Sonny Angara reminded the\nauthorities that they are allowed outside of their homes to obtain essential\ngoods and services.\n\n\"The guidelines for areas under GCQ are very clear. Senior citizens and\npersons below 21 years of age, while required to continue staying inside their\nhomes, are allowed to go out to buy essential goods like food and medicine and\nto obtain essential services,\" Angara said.\n\nBased on what has been reported on the first day of GCQ for Metro Manila, Cebu\nCity and Mandaue City, Angara noted that the issues faced by seniors who went\nout of their homes appears to be related to the interpretation of essential\nservices.\n\nThere were seniors who went out to collect their pensions and needed to take\npublic transport such as the MRT-3 and LRT lines but were prevented from\nboarding, \"because of IATF rules.\"\n\nAn elderly woman in Quezon City had to walk for hours because of the absence\nof jeeps and other modes of public transport and when she finally arrived at\nthe MRT-3 station, she was reportedly turned away because seniors were not\nallowed to travel.\n\n\"Clearly getting their pensions and important government documents is\nconsidered essential. Common sense is needed here. It is difficult for our\nseniors who have been confined to their homes for almost three months after\nthe rare times they have to go out are still going to be tortured. them,\n\"Angara said.\n\nAngara noted how the issue of easing restrictions on movement of seniors was\nbrought up before and settled already considering that many of them live alone\nand have to buy their own food and medicine and a significant number are also\nstill very productive members of society, meaning, they still have to go to\nwork.\n\nRepublic Act 7432 or the Senior Citizen's Act of 1992 was authored by Angara's\nfather, the late former Senate President Edgardo Angara and has since been\nreferred to as the Angara Law.\n\nThe younger Angara was among the authors of Republic Act 9994 or the Expanded\nSenior Citizen's Act of 2010, which provided more benefits and privileges to\nthe country's elderly.\n\n\"It is still important to give priority to seniors in grocery and drugstores\nand on public transport such as the MRT. There is no policy that prohibits\nthem from taking public transportation as long as their purpose is within the\nguidelines of the IATF, \"Angara said.",

    "html": "<p>Following reports of senior citizens facing difficulty in their movement under the general community quarantine, Senator Sonny Angara reminded the authorities that they are allowed outside of their homes to obtain essential goods and services.</p>\n<p>\"The guidelines for areas under GCQ are very clear. Senior citizens and persons below 21 years of age, while required to continue staying inside their homes, are allowed to go out to buy essential goods like food and medicine and to obtain essential services,\" Angara said.</p>\n<p>Based on what has been reported on the first day of GCQ for Metro Manila, Cebu City and Mandaue City, Angara noted that the issues faced by seniors who went out of their homes appears to be related to the interpretation of essential services.</p>\n<p>There were seniors who went out to collect their pensions and needed to take public transport such as the MRT-3 and LRT lines but were prevented from boarding, \"because of IATF rules.\"</p>\n<p>An elderly woman in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ph..qzoncty\">Quezon City</location> had to walk for hours because of the absence of jeeps and other modes of public transport and when she finally arrived at the MRT-3 station, she was reportedly turned away because seniors were not allowed to travel.</p>\n<p>\"Clearly getting their pensions and important government documents is considered essential. Common sense is needed here. It is difficult for our seniors who have been confined to their homes for almost three months after the rare times they have to go out are still going to be tortured. them, \"Angara said.</p>\n<p>Angara noted how the issue of easing restrictions on movement of seniors was brought up before and settled already considering that many of them live alone and have to buy their own food and medicine and a significant number are also still very productive members of society, meaning, they still have to go to work.</p>\n<p>Republic Act 7432 or the Senior Citizen's Act of 1992 was authored by Angara's father, the late former Senate President Edgardo Angara and has since been referred to as the Angara Law.</p>\n<p>The younger Angara was among the authors of Republic Act 9994 or the Expanded Senior Citizen's Act of 2010, which provided more benefits and privileges to the country's elderly.</p>\n<p>\"It is still important to give priority to seniors in grocery and drugstores and on public transport such as the MRT. There is no policy that prohibits them from taking public transportation as long as their purpose is within the guidelines of the IATF, \"Angara said.</p>",
