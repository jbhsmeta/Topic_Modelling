This comes after the governor issued Proclamation 20-57\nlast week concerning the health of agricultural workers. It also builds on the\nAgricultural Safety Plan released on May 28 and previous guidance from the\nWashington State Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nWe are fighting to keep everyone in Washington healthy, including a focus on\nhealth standards for all job sites, Inslee said. From the fields, to employer-\nprovided transportation and housing, to other congregate settings like packing\nhouses, there are countless points of exposure risk.\n\nThrough the Washington \"Safe Start\" plan, more businesses and activities will\nre-open in phases, with adequate safety and health standards in place. Each\nphase will be at least three weeks. Counties can apply to move to the next\nPhase of Safe Start. County applications will be approved or denied by the\nsecretary of the Department of Health. Twenty-seven counties have been\napproved to move to the next phase.",

This comes after the governor issued Proclamation 20-57 last week concerning the health of agricultural workers. It also builds on the Agricultural Safety Plan released on <chron>May 28</chron> and previous guidance from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0902005095\">Washington State Department of Labor and Industries</org>.</p>\n<p>We are fighting to keep everyone in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wa\">Washington</location> healthy, including a focus on health standards for all job sites, Inslee said. From the fields, to employer-provided transportation and housing, to other congregate settings like packing houses, there are countless points of exposure risk.</p>\n<p>Through the Washington \"Safe Start\" plan, more businesses and activities will re-open in phases, with adequate safety and health standards in place. Each phase will be at least three weeks. Counties can apply to move to the next Phase of Safe Start. County applications will be approved or denied by the secretary of the <org>Department of Health</org>. Twenty-seven counties have been approved to move to the next phase.</p>",
