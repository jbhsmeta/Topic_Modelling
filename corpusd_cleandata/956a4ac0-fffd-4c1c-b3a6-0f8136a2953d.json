    "text": "three years after its pilot aired, comedy the other one finally gets a full\nseries and you'll be doubled up with laughter PICK OF THE DAY the other\noneBBC1, 9pm/ BBC1 Wales, 11.25pm\n\nWHEN this pilot aired in 2017, it was such a hit that critics said it could\nhave legs for a whole series - and lo and behold, here is that series.\n\nTonight replays the pilot, which still feels fresh, a reminder of the\nbrilliant premise and the cracking ensemble cast of four women.\n\nIt starts with a surprise party for Colin, hosted by his wife Tess, played by\na scenestealing Rebecca Front, and their tense daughter Catherine, played by\nThe Windsors' Ellie White.\n\nBut Colin drops dead from a heart attack within moments of arriving, and Tess\nand Cathy soon discover he had another family living down the road.\n\nDownton's Siobhan Finneran is Colin's 'other wife' Marilyn, a chain smoker who\nloathes fresh air and has a mysterious health condition.\n\nShe describes Colin as \"a sexual shire horse of a man\".\n\nConveniently, Colin called his other daughter Catherine too. But Cat, played\nby Lauren Socha, couldn't be more different from her new sister Cathy.\n\nCathy has a slightly pathetic fiance, played by Amit Shah, works in risk\nmanagement, and is \"rattling through the seven stages of grief\" rather\nefficiently.\n\nMeanwhile, Cat works for Deliveroo and has \"completed Tinder\".\n\nSome polite wrestling over custody of Colin's ashes sets up the plot for this\nepisode.\n\n\"This will be the first time we all know where he is,\" notes Cat.\n\nA smart, sweet, comedy about what happens when you discover your dead dad has\na secret family, as the women try to make sense of it all.\n\nCAPTION: Marilyn Siobhan Finneran, Cat (Lauren Socha), Cathy (Ellie White) and\nTess (Rebecca Front) are trying to find their way after learning the man in\nall their lives was the same one; United in grief at Colin's funeral",
