    "text": "The number of homeless individuals in Pasadena held relatively steady in 2020,\ndown just 3% from 2019, but the decline may be statistically insignificant,\nofficials say.\n\nStill, when statewide and county homeless counts were seeing double-digit\nincreases in previous years, Pasadena's tally was a \"noteworthy success,\" a\ncity staff report reads, and it's something Union Station Homeless Services\nChief Executive Anne Miskey can get behind, even if she's not entirely\nsatisfied.\n\n\"We are pleased the results have not gone up,\" Miskey said in an interview on\nMonday. \"Compared to the numbers we're seeing in the rest of the county, I\nthink it is a testament to the work that's happening in Pasadena.\"\n\nFigures from the Los Angeles Countywide count, conducted in January by the Los\nAngeles Homeless Services Authority, are not yet publicly available. The\nnumbers for Pasadena, which conducts its own point-in-time count, typically\nare announced first.\n\nMiskey celebrated the coordination and support seen between organizations like\nhers, the city's housing, police and fire departments, and the local faith\ncommunity.\n\n\"There's a level of cooperation that's happening here, compared to other\ncommunities,\" Miskey said. \"It's those connections as a community that, I\nthink, have set us apart, and it's something we have to cultivate going\nforward.\"\n\nStill, while the results weren't bad, they weren't that great either, she\nsaid.\n\n\"It's not the numbers we want to see,\" Miskey said. \"We want to see them going\ndown dramatically.  We're on the right track in the community, but this is a\ntime for us to do more and do even better.\"\n\nThe homeless count isn't meant to be a holistic accounting of every single\nhomeless person in the city. It's supposed to be a snapshot of one night in\nPasadena - in this case, Jan. 22, 2020.\n\nCompared to 2019, when city volunteers counted 542 people experiencing\nhomelessness, this year they counted 527.\n\n\"While the exact number of people experiencing homelessness fluctuates on a\ndaily basis, generally Pasadena's numbers are holding stable following a\nsteady downward trend since 2011,\" the staff report reads.\n\nOfficials say there's 5% more people living in the city's homeless shelters\ncompared to 2019. Compared to the overall count, there's less wiggle room on\nthese figures, Miskey said, because it's significantly easier for officials to\nget accurate counts of the population living in shelters.\n\n\"Once you're in a shelter, staff are working with you directly to get you into\nhousing,\" she said, something that Pasadena has done well compared to its\nneighbors.\n\nMiskey said the city has found homes for \"a tremendous amount of people,\" but\nmore become homeless in Pasadena on a daily basis.\n\nThe staff report says that 54% of the people surveyed had been living in\nPasadena before they became homeless. On average, they lived in homes or\napartments in the city for 21 years before they ended up on the streets.\n\nThe two hardest hit populations are black or elderly, the report says, and it\ndovetails with national trends, Miskey said.\n\nCompared to 2019, Pasadena saw a 27% increase in homelessness among people\nages 62 years or older, the report says. That's despite the fact the\ndemographic only comprises 14% of the city's population.\n\nThe trend holds when one looks at older adults, 55 years old and up, which\nmake up 30% of the city's overall population and 40% of the homeless\npopulation.\n\nMiskey said this is a trend they've seen around the country, and the seniors\nwho end up homeless are often experiencing it for the first time. They land on\nthe streets when they can't afford the skyrocketing rent increases after their\nincomes are cut dramatically when, for instance, their spouse dies.\n\nIt's an issue Pasadena has focused on for the past few years and is poised to\ndo more with soon, as the city has approved key components of a housing\nproject at Heritage Square South, specifically designed for low-income and\nhomeless seniors.\n\nIn the African American population, Pasadena's figures held relatively steady\ncompared to 2019 - they're still hugely overrepresented with 31% of the\nhomeless population but only 10% of the city's general population.\n\n\"That's true across the country and is a direct result of years of policies\nthat have disproportionately affected black and other communities of color,\"\nMiskey said. \"Ultimately, blacks were kept out of the housing ownership\nmarket, which forced them into rental housing, then we see the dramatic\nincreases in rent in the country and people who have very little equity and\nforced into low paying jobs.\n\n\"All these things come together to make the perfect storm.\"\n\nOther notable statistics:\n\n* Veterans comprise 7% of the homeless population counted in 2020, which is \"relatively stable compared to previous years,\" the report says.\n\n* The chronically homeless make up slightly more than half of the city's homeless population.\n\n* For the second year in a row, there were no unsheltered homeless families in Pasadena, but 24 families with children were living in the city's shelters. It's a similar proportion that officials saw in 2019.\n\nFor Miskey, the key to improving the city's homeless situation in the future\nis listening to the homeless population better.\n\n\"That's a lesson that I think we're all learning more and more,\" she said.\n\"It's not about us saving people. It's about us working together and coming\ntogether as a community for all our sakes.\"\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been updated to clarify one of Anne Miskey's\nstatements.",

    "title": "Pasadena's 2020 homeless count numbers are in",
    "html": "<p>The number of homeless individuals in Pasadena held relatively steady in 2020, down just 3% from 2019, but the decline may be statistically insignificant, officials say.</p>\n<p>Still, when statewide and county homeless counts were seeing double-digit increases in previous years, Pasadena's tally was a \"noteworthy success,\" a city staff report reads, and it's something Union Station Homeless Services Chief Executive <person>Anne Miskey</person> can get behind, even if she's not entirely satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are pleased the results have not gone up,\" Miskey said in an interview on Monday. \"Compared to the numbers we're seeing in the rest of the county, I think it is a testament to the work that's happening in Pasadena.\"</p>\n\n<p>Figures from the Los Angeles Countywide count, conducted in January by the <org>Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority</org>, are not yet publicly available. The numbers for Pasadena, which conducts its own point-in-time count, typically are announced first.</p>\n\n<p>Miskey celebrated the coordination and support seen between organizations like hers, the city's housing, police and fire departments, and the local faith community.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's a level of cooperation that's happening here, compared to other communities,\" Miskey said. \"It's those connections as a community that, I think, have set us apart, and it's something we have to cultivate going forward.\"</p>\n\n<p>Still, while the results weren't bad, they weren't that great either, she said.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not the numbers we want to see,\" Miskey said. \"We want to see them going down dramatically. &#133; We're on the right track in the community, but this is a time for us to do more and do even better.\"</p>\n\n<p>The homeless count isn't meant to be a holistic accounting of every single homeless person in the city. It's supposed to be a snapshot of one night in Pasadena - in this case, <chron>Jan. 22, 2020</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to 2019, when city volunteers counted 542 people experiencing homelessness, this year they counted 527.</p>\n\n<p>\"While the exact number of people experiencing homelessness fluctuates on a daily basis, generally Pasadena's numbers are holding stable following a steady downward trend since 2011,\" the staff report reads.</p>\n\n<p>Officials say there's 5% more people living in the city's homeless shelters compared to 2019. Compared to the overall count, there's less wiggle room on these figures, Miskey said, because it's significantly easier for officials to get accurate counts of the population living in shelters.</p>\n\n<p>\"Once you're in a shelter, staff are working with you directly to get you into housing,\" she said, something that Pasadena has done well compared to its neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>Miskey said the city has found homes for \"a tremendous amount of people,\" but more become homeless in Pasadena on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>The staff report says that 54% of the people surveyed had been living in Pasadena before they became homeless. On average, they lived in homes or apartments in the city for 21 years before they ended up on the streets.</p>\n\n<p>The two hardest hit populations are black or elderly, the report says, and it dovetails with national trends, Miskey said.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to 2019, Pasadena saw a 27% increase in homelessness among people ages 62 years or older, the report says. That's despite the fact the demographic only comprises 14% of the city's population.</p>\n\n<p>The trend holds when one looks at older adults, 55 years old and up, which make up 30% of the city's overall population and 40% of the homeless population.</p>\n\n<p>Miskey said this is a trend they've seen around the country, and the seniors who end up homeless are often experiencing it for the first time. They land on the streets when they can't afford the skyrocketing rent increases after their incomes are cut dramatically when, for instance, their spouse dies.</p>\n\n<p>It's an issue Pasadena has focused on for the past few years and is poised to do more with soon, as the city has approved key components of a housing project at <org>Heritage Square South</org>, specifically designed for low-income and homeless seniors.</p>\n\n<p>In the <org>African American</org> population, Pasadena's figures held relatively steady compared to 2019 - they're still hugely overrepresented with 31% of the homeless population but only 10% of the city's general population.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's true across the country and is a direct result of years of policies that have disproportionately affected black and other communities of color,\" Miskey said. \"Ultimately, blacks were kept out of the housing ownership market, which forced them into rental housing, then we see the dramatic increases in rent in the country and people who have very little equity and forced into low paying jobs.</p>\n\n<p>\"All these things come together to make the perfect storm.\"</p>\n\n<p>Other notable statistics:</p>\n\n<p>* Veterans comprise 7% of the homeless population counted in 2020, which is \"relatively stable compared to previous years,\" the report says.</p>\n\n<p>* The chronically homeless make up slightly more than half of the city's homeless population.</p>\n\n<p>* For the second year in a row, there were no unsheltered homeless families in Pasadena, but 24 families with children were living in the city's shelters. It's a similar proportion that officials saw in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>For Miskey, the key to improving the city's homeless situation in the future is listening to the homeless population better.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's a lesson that I think we're all learning more and more,\" she said. \"It's not about us saving people. It's about us working together and coming together as a community for all our sakes.\"</p>\n\n<p>EDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been updated to clarify one of <person>Anne Miskey's</person> statements.</p>",
