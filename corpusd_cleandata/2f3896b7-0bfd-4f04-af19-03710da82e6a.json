The Council then will\ndiscuss Executive Order 13921, Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and\nEconomic Growth, which President Trump issued on May 7, 2020. Next, the\nCouncil will review its list of 2020-2024 research priorities and hear the\nScientific and Statistical Committee's recommendations on any suggested\nrevisions. Following some discussion, the Council will approve the final list.\nMembers of the public then will have the opportunity to speak during an open\ncomment period on issues that relate to Council business but are not included\non the published agenda for this meeting. The Council asks the public to limit\nremarks to 3-5 minutes. These comments will be received through the webinar. A\nguide for how to publicly comment through the webinar is available on the\nCouncil website at <https://s3.amazonaws.com/nefmc.org/NEFMC-meeting-remote-\nparticipation_generic.pdf>.\n\nFollowing the lunch break, the Council will take up the Ecosystem-Based\nFishery Management (EBFM) Committee report and receive: (1) A presentation on\ndraft EBFM public outreach materials produced by Green Fin Studio; and (2) a\nprogress report from the EBFM Plan Development Team on the development of\ntangible worked examples to demonstrate the Council's example Fishery\nEcosystem Plan (eFEP) for Georges Bank. The Council then will hear from its\nSkate Committee, which will provide a progress report on Committee actions\nrelated to Amendment 5 to the Northeast Skate Complex Fishery Management Plan\n(FMP). The Council will discuss whether to pursue the development of a limited\naccess program for the skate wing and/or bait fisheries through this\namendment. The Council then will adjourn for the day.\n\nWednesday, June 24, 2020\n\nThe Council will begin the day by receiving a preliminary report on approaches\nto calculating discards that are deducted from the monkfish annual catch\ntarget to determine total allowable landings for the monkfish fishery. The\npresentation will be followed by Council discussion. Next, the Scallop\nCommittee will report on four items. The first will be Amendment 21 to the\nAtlantic Sea Scallop FMP, which is being developed to address: (1) Northern\nGulf of Maine Management Area issues, (2) the Limited Access General Category\n(LAGC) possession limit, and (3) individual fishing quota (IFQ) transfers. The\nCouncil will select preferred alternatives for this amendment and approve the\nDraft Environmental Assessment for public hearings. The Council also will\ndiscuss the timeline for this action. Second, the Council will review and\napprove 2021-2022 priorities for the Scallop Research Set-Aside Program.\nThird, the Council will initiate Framework Adjustment 33, which will include\n2021 fishing year specifications and 2022 default specifications. The Council\nwill discuss the timeline for the framework given delays in resource surveys\ndue to the COVID-19 situation. Finally, the Scallop Committee will provide\nfeedback on Executive Order 13921.\n\nFollowing the lunch break, the Habitat Committee will report on several items\nwith contributions from partner presenters. Agenda items include: (1) A\nCommittee update on the development of habitat policies for aquaculture,\nsubmarine cables, and floating offshore wind technology; (2) an update on the\nNortheast Regional Marine Fish Habitat Assessment; (3) a Bureau of Ocean\nEnergy Management (BOEM) briefing on the June 2020 Supplemental Environmental\nImpact Statement for the Vineyard Wind project and other BOEM updates; (4) a\nNOAA Fisheries briefing on the Habitat Climate Vulnerability Assessment for\nthe Northeast Region; and (5) an update from the Responsible Offshore Science\nAlliance. Next, the Council will receive a progress report on the\ncollaborative effort between the Northeast Regional Ocean Council and the\nResponsible Offshore Development Alliance to update commercial fisheries data\non the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Data Portals. The Council will spend\nthe remainder of the afternoon on the Atlantic Herring Committee report, which\nwill cover three items. The Council will receive an update on Framework\nAdjustment 7 to the Atlantic Herring FMP, which is being developed to protect\nspawning herring on Georges Bank. As part of this agenda item, the Council\nwill receive a report on a recent leadership conference call that was held\nwith ASMFC to discuss Atlantic herring management. The Council also will\nreceive an update on Framework Adjustment 8, which includes fishing year\n2021-2023 specifications. The Council potentially may approve the range of\nalternatives being developed as part of this framework to adjust measures in\nthe Atlantic Herring FMP that may inhibit the Atlantic mackerel fishery from\nachieving optimum yield. Finally, the Council will receive Herring Committee\nfeedback on Executive Order 13921. After this discussion, the Council will\nadjourn for the day.\n\nThursday, June 25, 2020\n\nThe Council will begin the day with the Small-Mesh Multispecies (Whiting)\nReport. The Council is expected to take final action on Framework Adjustment\n62 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP, which focuses on measures to rebuild\nsouthern red hake. The Whiting Committee also will provide feedback to the\nCouncil on Executive Order 13921\\. Next, the Council will receive an overview\nof the Atlantic Cod Stock Structure Working Group report, which will be\nfollowed by a presentation on the peer review of report. The Council will\ndiscuss the report and peer review findings. The GARFO Regional Administrator\nthen will provide a briefing on a petition for rulemaking on Atlantic cod and\nrequest that the Council consult with NMFS on this matter. The Council will\nengage in a discussion on how to address issues in the petition that may have\nmerit.\n\nFollowing the lunch break, the Council will spend the full afternoon on the\nGroundfish Committee report, which includes several items. The Council will\nreceive an overview of comments received during recent webinar public hearings\nfor Groundfish Monitoring Amendment 23 and then discuss next steps and the\ntimeline for final action. In a follow-up to the April meeting, the Council\nwill discuss and potentially approve Groundfish Committee recommendations for\nadjustments to commercial and recreational measures to mitigate the impacts of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. This discussion may include a possible request for\nsecretarial emergency action for measures related to commercial carry-over\nprovisions, as well as recreational measures for Gulf of Maine haddock and\ncod. The Council also will initiate Framework Adjustment 61 to the Northeast\nMultispecies FMP, which will include: total allowable catches for U.S./Canada\nstocks of Eastern Georges Bank (GB) cod, Eastern GB haddock, and GB yellowtail\nflounder; 2021-2023 specifications for roughly half of the groundfish stocks;\nand other measures. Finally, the Groundfish Committee will provide feedback on\nExecutive Order 13921. The Council then will close out the meeting with other\nbusiness.\n\nAlthough non-emergency issues not contained on this agenda may come before the\nCouncil for discussion, those issues may not be the subject of formal action\nduring this meeting. Council action will be restricted to those issues\nspecifically listed in this notice and any issues arising after publication of\nthis notice that require emergency action under section 305(c) of the\nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, provided the public\nhas been notified of the Council's intent to take final action to address the\nemergency. The public also should be aware that the meeting will be recorded.\nConsistent with 16 U.S.C. 1852, a copy of the recording is available upon\nrequest.\n\nSpecial Accommodations\n\nThis meeting is being conducted entirely by webinar. Requests for auxiliary\naids should be directed to Thomas A. Nies (see ADDRESSES) at least 5 days\nprior to the meeting date.\n\nAuthority:16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.\n\nDated: June 2, 2020.\n\nTracey L.

The Council also will receive an update on Framework Adjustment 8, which includes fishing year 2021-2023 specifications.

This discussion may include a possible request for secretarial emergency action for measures related to commercial carry-over provisions, as well as recreational measures for Gulf of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.me\">Maine</location> haddock and cod. The Council also will initiate Framework Adjustment 61 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP, which will include: total allowable catches for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>/<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> stocks of <org>Eastern Georges Bank</org> (GB) cod, Eastern GB haddock, and GB yellowtail flounder; 2021-2023 specifications for roughly half of the groundfish stocks; and other measures.
