Aimee spoke in a very honest way and encouraged everyone.\n\n\"She answered everyone's questions and it is reassuring to know that she has\nbeen through it all before and dealt with it.\n\n\"It is nice that someone who is a big star in the sport can speak to us in\nsuch a down to earth and approachable way.\"\n\nAimee is the latest big name signed up by the club, following hot on the heels\nof Olympic medallist Jazz Carlin, who carried out a fitness session with\nsenior swimmers.",

Aimee spoke in a very honest way and encouraged everyone.</p>\n\n<p>\"She answered everyone's questions and it is reassuring to know that she has been through it all before and dealt with it.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is nice that someone who is a big star in the sport can speak to us in such a down to earth and approachable way.\"</p>\n\n<p>Aimee is the latest big name signed up by the club, following hot on the heels of Olympic medallist <person>Jazz Carlin</person>, who carried out a fitness session with senior swimmers.</p>",
