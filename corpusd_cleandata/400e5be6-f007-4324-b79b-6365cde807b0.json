    "text": "When the pandemic hit this winter, city people with second homes moved into\nthem. This upset the rhythm of beach, lake and mountain communities that\nattract a lot of \"summer people\" - but not until the summer.\n\nAs for winter destinations - Florida, Arizona, Texas or any ski area - the\nsnowbirds seem to be lingering into the spring. Full-time locals may wonder\nwhen they will leave. They're going to leave, right?\n\nOff-season was traditionally a time for year-rounders to enjoy less traffic\nand a calmer scene at restaurants and stores. For those of modest means, it\noffered respite from the affluent part-time residents with their lust for the\nbest tables and air of permanent leisure.\n\nThe question now is whether the coronavirus has messed up the migration\npatterns for good. After all, restrictions on gathering remain largely in\nplace in the urban centers, where the second-home people have their first\nhomes. Pleasures of city life have been greatly curtailed.\n\nThat seasonal residents tend to have more money than the permanent locals has\nlong raised resentments along socioeconomic lines. The irritation is further\ninflamed by the belief that city people may be bringing in the virus along\nwith their fancy laptops and single-malt scotches. Meanwhile, small towns and\nrural areas usually don't have the medical infrastructure to treat large\nnumbers.\n\nThis phenomenon is seen in Europe as well, only with more conflict. As the\ngentry from Paris surged into their second homes on peaceful French islands\noff the Atlantic Coast, class tensions flared. The sight of Parisians on\nseemingly endless vacation - kite surfing, biking and relaxing on the beach -\nas locals continue their long struggle with economic decline has led to\nunfriendliness. Tires on cars with Paris plates have been slashed. One mayor\ntried to block a bridge from the mainland.\n\nSimilar scenes have played out in Italy, where residents of the rich but\nvirus-stricken northern cities headed for the country's poorer south. And when\nMadrid shut down, urbanites streamed to their homes on Spain's Mediterranean\ncoast. Some countries, such as Norway and Belgium, forbid people from self-\nquarantining in their second homes.\n\nThat's a more perilous path here. In late March, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\ntried to set up highway checkpoints to stop cars from New York and Louisiana,\ntwo coronavirus hotspots, and order their passengers to self-quarantine for\ntwo weeks.\n\n\"It's not fair to the people of Florida,\" DeSantis said, that outsiders keep\ncoming in. Thing is, many of those \"outsiders\" own houses or condos in\nFlorida. Do they get to skip property taxes this time around?\n\nMany residents of the largely abandoned cities, meanwhile, seem to enjoy\nhaving the place back to themselves. A restaurant owner in the over-touristed\ncity of Dubrovnik, Croatia, bemoaned the loss of business but likes not having\nto push his way through cruise ship crowds. From his terrace overlooking the\nOld Port, he now sees fishing nets laid out to dry instead of tables occupied\nby swarms of tourists.\n\nA web developer living in Rome talks of enjoying his walks to the uncrowded\nSpanish Steps. The city has turned \"romantic,\" he said, \"like a dream.\"\n\nWell, what happens when our world reopens in earnest? Will the summer people\nor snowbirds fly back to their primary nests?\n\nThe lockdown has demonstrated that many can do their jobs from wherever\nthere's a good internet connection. If remote work becomes more permanent,\nsecond-home people may have even less of an incentive to leave.\n\nWill second homes turn into primary residences? The summer people will\nprobably hang on through the warm weather. Look to the snowbirds, right now,\nfor a hint of an answer.\n\nFroma Harrop is a syndicated columnist.

    "html": "<p>When the pandemic hit this winter, city people with second homes moved into them. This upset the rhythm of beach, lake and mountain communities that attract a lot of \"summer people\" - but not until the summer.</p>\n<p>As for winter destinations - <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.az\">Arizona</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> or any ski area - the snowbirds seem to be lingering into the spring. Full-time locals may wonder when they will leave. They're going to leave, right?</p>\n\n<p>Off-season was traditionally a time for year-rounders to enjoy less traffic and a calmer scene at restaurants and stores. For those of modest means, it offered respite from the affluent part-time residents with their lust for the best tables and air of permanent leisure.</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether the coronavirus has messed up the migration patterns for good. After all, restrictions on gathering remain largely in place in the urban centers, where the second-home people have their first homes. Pleasures of city life have been greatly curtailed.</p>\n\n<p>That seasonal residents tend to have more money than the permanent locals has long raised resentments along socioeconomic lines. The irritation is further inflamed by the belief that city people may be bringing in the virus along with their fancy laptops and single-malt scotches. Meanwhile, small towns and rural areas usually don't have the medical infrastructure to treat large numbers.</p>\n\n<p>This phenomenon is seen in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location> as well, only with more conflict. As the gentry from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/fr..paris\">Paris</location> surged into their second homes on peaceful French islands off the <location>Atlantic Coast</location>, class tensions flared. The sight of Parisians on seemingly endless vacation - kite surfing, biking and relaxing on the beach - as locals continue their long struggle with economic decline has led to unfriendliness. Tires on cars with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/fr..paris\">Paris</location> plates have been slashed. One mayor tried to block a bridge from the mainland.</p>\n\n<p>Similar scenes have played out in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/it\">Italy</location>, where residents of the rich but virus-stricken northern cities headed for the country's poorer south. And when <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/es..madrid\">Madrid</location> shut down, urbanites streamed to their homes on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/es\">Spain's</location> Mediterranean coast. Some countries, such as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/no\">Norway</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/be\">Belgium</location>, forbid people from self-quarantining in their second homes.</p>\n\n<p>That's a more perilous path here. In late March, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> Gov. <person>Ron DeSantis</person> tried to set up highway checkpoints to stop cars from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location>, two coronavirus hotspots, and order their passengers to self-quarantine for two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not fair to the people of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>,\" DeSantis said, that outsiders keep coming in. Thing is, many of those \"outsiders\" own houses or condos in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>. Do they get to skip property taxes this time around?</p>\n\n<p>Many residents of the largely abandoned cities, meanwhile, seem to enjoy having the place back to themselves. A restaurant owner in the over-touristed city of Dubrovnik, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hr\">Croatia</location>, bemoaned the loss of business but likes not having to push his way through cruise ship crowds. From his terrace overlooking the Old Port, he now sees fishing nets laid out to dry instead of tables occupied by swarms of tourists.</p>\n\n<p>A web developer living in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/it..rome\">Rome</location> talks of enjoying his walks to the uncrowded Spanish Steps. The city has turned \"romantic,\" he said, \"like a dream.\"</p>\n\n<p>Well, what happens when our world reopens in earnest? Will the summer people or snowbirds fly back to their primary nests?</p>\n\n<p>The lockdown has demonstrated that many can do their jobs from wherever there's a good internet connection. If remote work becomes more permanent, second-home people may have even less of an incentive to leave.</p>\n\n<p>Will second homes turn into primary residences? The summer people will probably hang on through the warm weather. Look to the snowbirds, right now, for a hint of an answer.</p>\n\n<p><person>Froma Harrop</person> is a syndicated columnist.
