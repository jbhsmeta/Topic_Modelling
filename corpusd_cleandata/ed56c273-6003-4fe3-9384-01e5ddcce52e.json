The reporting party told\nauthorities he was throwing trash away at the dumpster.\n\nThe male suspect, later identified as 28-year-old Devon Lovell Holloway of\nLehi, allegedly approached the complainant and asked if he knew who he was.\n\nAccording to arrest documents, the complainant told Holloway he did not, and\nthat is when Holloway allegedly drew a silver handgun and pointed it at the\nman.\n\nHolloway then asked the man if \"he thought he was playing,\" according to the\nprobable cause affidavit, and continued to threaten the man before getting in\nhis vehicle and driving away.\n\nAnother couple were sitting outside their apartment when Holloway pulled up\nand parked his car to go into his apartment.\n\nWhen the couple asked Holloway how he was doing, Holloway allegedly brandished\nthe firearm again and pointed it at them, stating he was going to shoot them\nin the face, according to arrest documents.\n\nHolloway went into his apartment.\n\nThe couple contacted police, who arrived on scene to find Holloway outside of\nthe apartment complex. Authorities took Holloway into custody and read him his\nMiranda rights.\n\nHolloway allegedly told police the handgun was inside his apartment, advising\nauthorities that he believed people were threatening him and wanted to do him\nharm, according to the probable cause statement.\n\nHolloway said he was carrying the handgun with him for protection, stating he\nallegedly drew the firearm when speaking to the first man because he felt\nthreatened by the man's body language.\n\nNot wanting \"to bring a knife to a gun fight,\" Holloway allegedly brandished\nhis weapon to protect himself, threatening the man before heading for the\ncomfort of his apartment, he told police. That is when the couple approached\nhim.\n\nAccording to arrest documents, Holloway said the couple were argumentative\ntoward the situation. Holloway told police he already had the gun in his hand\nwhen he approached the couple, going into his apartment.\n\nHe allegedly said he moved to the location where officials found him because\nhe knew the police would be called and wanted to meet authorities outside\nwithout a weapon.\n\nHolloway was taken into custody under the suspicion of third-degree felony\naggravated assault. He is currently being held at the Utah County Jail on\n$15,000 bail.",
