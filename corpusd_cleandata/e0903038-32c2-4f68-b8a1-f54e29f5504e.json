    "text": "JONESBORO - Lots of students are in JROTC.\n\nThere are more than 880 Air Force units throughout the world. There are units\nthroughout high schools in the U.S. and military bases across the globe.\n\nBut Jonesboro's Laityn Tippy is the only cadet on the planet who the Air Force\nrecognized as its top high school member for her leadership and skill.\n\nTippy, who is the commander of her unit, attends Westside High School. Tippy,\n17 and only the second cadet to receive the award, plans to apply for the\nUnited States Air Force Academy, the nation's higher-education option\ndedicated to training Air Force officers in Colorado Springs.\n\nShe said she's thankful for the opportunities in community service and the\nprivilege to lead her unit.\n\nTippy didn't join JROTC, which stands for Junior Reserve Officer Training\nCorps and is dedicated to high school students, for recognition, she said.\n\n\"I'm just really thankful we have a really good JROTC unit and that our\ninstructors relay actually care about us,\" Tippy said, crediting her\ninstructor Maj. Scott Norman, the senior aerospace science instructor at\nWestside High School.\n\nNorman said Tippy is renowned for her humble attitude and focus on service.\n\n\"When I called she said 'what did you do to deserve this?' I said 'I don't\nthink you realize how awesome you are,'\" Norman said about when he let her\nknow that she won the national award.\n\nTippy keeps the cadet-run unit that she leads in tip-top shape.\n\nThe cadet has maintained at least a 4.0 throughout her high school days, and\nshe's on student council. Tippy has also taken numerous Advanced Placement\ncourses designated for students to college credit and she's on the National\nHonor Society.\n\nThe girl is someone who all teachers know as a good student and good person,\nNorman said.\n\n\"If you ask any of the teachers at Westside High School, they can't say enough\nkind things about her,\" Norman said.\n\nHer willingness to serve the community is part of why the Air Force awarded\nTippy the honor.\n\n\"They really don't like to see somebody be just in JROTC,\" Norman said. \"They\nwant to see somebody who's a leader throughout the school.\"\n\nNorman called Tippy the best cadet he's seen in his seven years instructing\nJROTC.\n\n\"I'm most impressed with students who show maturity beyond their years,\"\nNorman said, noting that Tippy is always professional when it comes to leading\nher unit.\n\nNorman nominated Tippy for the award, and last year, he nominated Luke Walz,\nwho was awarded the honor at the state level.\n\nWalz has been accepted to the Air Force Academy, where Tippy plans to apply.\n\n\"That was usually one of the things that my interviewers would say something\nabout,\" Walz said, stating that the award was one of the reasons he was\naccepted into the academy.\n\nHe said he expects that with an award recognizing Tippy as the best cadet in\nthe world, she'll sail through the application process.\n\n\"Oh it'll be super helpful, like national cadet No. 1 that's like insane,\nespecially from a little town in Arkansas,\" Walz said. He also called her an\namazing person.\n\nTippy said she's excited to join the military and serve the American people.\n\n\"I think the adventure you get in the military is an experience you don't get\nanywhere else,\" Tippy said.\n\nTippy has dreamed of being a pilot her whole life.\n\n\"Like hundreds of years ago, no one was doing this, and we have the freedom\nto, so I want to protect that freedom,\" Tippy said about flying.",

There are units throughout high schools in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and military bases across the globe.</p>\n\n<p>But Jonesboro's Laityn Tippy is the only cadet on the planet who the <org>Air Force</org> recognized as its top high school member for her leadership and skill.</p>\n\n<p>Tippy, who is the commander of her unit, attends <org>Westside High School</org>. Tippy, 17 and only the second cadet to receive the award, plans to apply for the <org>United States Air Force Academy</org>, the nation's higher-education option dedicated to training <org>Air Force</org> officers in <location>Colorado Springs</location>.</p>\n\n<p>She said she's thankful for the opportunities in community service and the privilege to lead her unit.</p>\n\n<p>Tippy didn't join JROTC, which stands for <org>Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps</org> and is dedicated to high school students, for recognition, she said.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm just really thankful we have a really good JROTC unit and that our instructors relay actually care about us,\" Tippy said, crediting her instructor Maj. <person>Scott Norman</person>, the senior aerospace science instructor at <org>Westside High School</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Norman said Tippy is renowned for her humble attitude and focus on service.</p>\n\n<p>\"When I called she said 'what did you do to deserve this?' I said 'I don't think you realize how awesome you are,'\" Norman said about when he let her know that she won the national award.</p>\n\n<p>Tippy keeps the cadet-run unit that she leads in tip-top shape.</p>\n\n<p>The cadet has maintained at least a 4.0 throughout her high school days, and she's on student council. Tippy has also taken numerous Advanced Placement courses designated for students to college credit and she's on the <org>National Honor Society</org>.</p>\n\n<p>The girl is someone who all teachers know as a good student and good person, Norman said.</p>\n\n<p>\"If you ask any of the teachers at <org>Westside High School</org>, they can't say enough kind things about her,\" Norman said.</p>\n\n<p>Her willingness to serve the community is part of why the <org>Air Force</org> awarded Tippy the honor.</p>\n\n<p>\"They really don't like to see somebody be just in JROTC,\" Norman said. \"They want to see somebody who's a leader throughout the school.\"</p>\n\n<p>Norman called Tippy the best cadet he's seen in his seven years instructing JROTC.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm most impressed with students who show maturity beyond their years,\" Norman said, noting that Tippy is always professional when it comes to leading her unit.</p>\n\n<p>Norman nominated Tippy for the award, and last year, he nominated <person>Luke Walz</person>, who was awarded the honor at the state level.</p>\n\n<p>Walz has been accepted to the <org>Air Force Academy</org>, where Tippy plans to apply.</p>\n\n<p>\"That was usually one of the things that my interviewers would say something about,\" Walz said, stating that the award was one of the reasons he was accepted into the academy.</p>\n\n<p>He said he expects that with an award recognizing Tippy as the best cadet in the world, she'll sail through the application process.</p>\n\n<p>\"Oh it'll be super helpful, like national cadet No. 1 that's like insane, especially from a little town in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ar\">Arkansas</location>,\" Walz said. He also called her an amazing person.</p>\n\n<p>Tippy said she's excited to join the military and serve the American people.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think the adventure you get in the military is an experience you don't get anywhere else,\" Tippy said.</p>\n\n<p>Tippy has dreamed of being a pilot her whole life.</p>\n\n<p>\"Like hundreds of years ago, no one was doing this, and we have the freedom to, so I want to protect that freedom,\" Tippy said about flying.</p>",
