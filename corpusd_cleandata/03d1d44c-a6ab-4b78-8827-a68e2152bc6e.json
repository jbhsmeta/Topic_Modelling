    "text": "On Saturday morning, Shelbyville citizens gathered in front of the Shelby\nCounty Courthouse to demand change.\n\nThe event, organized by Brittany Andolz, Deja Holly, Hunter Jarman, and Hope\nFenton was put on to show the community's support for the Black Lives Matter\nmovement and protest the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"We're here to hear our black community speak and let us know what is really\nhappening in our community,\" Andolz said.\n\nThe event began with a prayer and was followed by 8 minutes and 46 seconds of\nsilence. Everyone was silent during the time, including many young children\nthat were in attendance. After, community members were encouraged to take the\nmegaphone and voice their thoughts and concerns.\n\nMichael Prolifik Ellis stood up and talked about his family's struggles being\nout in the community.\n\n\"We can not go to Walmart without someone looking at us crazy,\" he said. \"We\ncan't eat our food in a diner, without someone looking at us crazy. We can't\njog down the streets without someone looking at us crazy. It's not fair,\" he\nsaid.\n\nDeja Holly said she was the only black girl in her class at Triton Central\nHigh School her freshman year. She sat by herself, was called racial slurs,\nand would have black jokes made to her face.\n\n\"They did not like me, they didn't want me there,\" she said.\n\nAndrea Potter spoke about issues that her 12-year-old daughter, who she\nidentified as black, has dealt with bullying at school because of her racial\nidentity.\n\n\"I think it's time racists get called out and be uncomfortable,\" she said.\n\nWade Lewis, a white man in attendance said he was there to be a part of the\nsolution.\n\n\"It's good to hear people speaking from their hearts,\" he said. \"There's a lot\nof pain and frustration, but still a lot of hope.\"\n\nAfter the community voiced their thoughts, a march was made around\nShelbyville. Tom DeBaun, mayor, attended that march.\n\n\"As the mayor it is important I'm there to hear what is being said and to\nrepresent city government,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he felt it was his duty as a father to bring his family, and have\nthem be a part of the experience. He feels that in order to make Shelbyville a\nplace everyone wants to live, all voices need to be heard.\n\nThe protest remained civil, and there were a little over 100 people in\nattendance.\n\n\"If everyone came together this world would be a better place,\" Ellis said.",

    "html": "<p>On Saturday morning, Shelbyville citizens gathered in front of the <location>Shelby County Courthouse</location> to demand change.</p>\n<p>The event, organized by Brittany Andolz, <person>Deja Holly</person>, <person>Hunter Jarman</person>, and <person>Hope Fenton</person> was put on to show the community's support for the <org>Black Lives Matter</org> movement and protest the death of <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're here to hear our black community speak and let us know what is really happening in our community,\" Andolz said.</p>\n\n<p>The event began with a prayer and was followed by 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence. Everyone was silent during the time, including many young children that were in attendance. After, community members were encouraged to take the megaphone and voice their thoughts and concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Prolifik Ellis stood up and talked about his family's struggles being out in the community.</p>\n\n<p>\"We can not go to Walmart without someone looking at us crazy,\" he said. \"We can't eat our food in a diner, without someone looking at us crazy. We can't jog down the streets without someone looking at us crazy. It's not fair,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Deja Holly</person> said she was the only black girl in her class at <org>Triton Central High School</org> her freshman year. She sat by herself, was called racial slurs, and would have black jokes made to her face.</p>\n\n<p>\"They did not like me, they didn't want me there,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Andrea Potter</person> spoke about issues that her 12-year-old daughter, who she identified as black, has dealt with bullying at school because of her racial identity.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think it's time racists get called out and be uncomfortable,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Wade Lewis, a white man in attendance said he was there to be a part of the solution.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's good to hear people speaking from their hearts,\" he said. \"There's a lot of pain and frustration, but still a lot of hope.\"</p>\n\n<p>After the community voiced their thoughts, a march was made around Shelbyville. <person>Tom DeBaun</person>, mayor, attended that march.</p>\n\n<p>\"As the mayor it is important I'm there to hear what is being said and to represent city government,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>He also said he felt it was his duty as a father to bring his family, and have them be a part of the experience. He feels that in order to make Shelbyville a place everyone wants to live, all voices need to be heard.</p>\n\n<p>The protest remained civil, and there were a little over 100 people in attendance.</p>\n\n<p>\"If everyone came together this world would be a better place,\" Ellis said.</p>",
