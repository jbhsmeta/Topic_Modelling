    "text": "Since its origin in 1950, Carrier has been recognized as the industry leader\nin designing and building foundry equipment. Our unique capabilities have\nserved metalcasters around the world longer than any other full-line vibrating\nequipment manufacturer. Leaders in innovation, holding multiple patents,\nCarrier specializes in state-of-the-art applied technology for the most\nefficient and reliable foundry equipment available to meet the industry's\nneeds.\n\nUnique Solutions for the Foundry Industry\n\nConveyors and Feeders: Carriers Natural-Frequency vibrating equipment utilizes\na drive tuned in resonance with the spring-supported weight system. Most of\nthe force required to vibrate the trough is alternatively stored and released\nby springs. Power requirements are minimal.\n\nFluid Bed Sand Coolers: Carrier's patented fluidizing drilled decks evenly\ndistribute air into the sand bed, preventing hole pluggage and maximizing\nthermal efficiency. Air volume controls regulate and maintain supply and\nexhaust air volumes at a constant preset level. A special hood design\nminimizes dusting and produces more uniform exhaust velocities. The result is\nconsistent return sand temperature and moisture content.\n\nDelta-Phase[R] Shakeouts: The Delta-Phase[R] Shakeout improves foundry\nprofitability by reducing maintenance costs, eliminating or reducing casting\ndamage, and maximizing sand removal. The heart of the Delta Phase[R] Shakeout\nis the process controller. Through precise vibration angle control, the Delta-\nPhase[R] Shakeout allows the operator to manage the conveying speed and\nretention time of castings on the shakeout deck-optimizing sand removal.\n\nBarrel Horse [TM] Shakeouts: The Barrel Horse Sand and Casting Processor is a\nproven one-step solution to casting damage and sand mix problems. Unlike\nconventional rotary shakeouts that lift and drop castings, the Barrel Horse\naction allows castings to swim in the sand, constantly blending via vibratory\nmotion. Through this agitation and mixing method, castings are gently cleaned,\nexcellent heat transfer occurs for a cooler casting, and sand lumps are\nreduced for homogeneous return sand.\n\nCompany Executive Chuck Mitchell Vice President of Sales\n\nVibrating Equipment, Inc.\n\nMission Statement\n\nCarrier's purpose and employee charge is to design and fabricate innovative\nprocess machinery solutions that exceed customer expectations. To accomplish\nthis, we are committed to:\n\n* Seek ways to continuously improve the products and services offered to our customers\n\n* Establish and review objectives necessary for our continual improvement effort\n\n* Provide a safe, challenging, and rewarding work environment for our most important asset: our employee owners.\n\nFoundry Equipment Heavy Duty Feeders Furnace Charge Feeders Cooling Conveyors\nMold Dump Conveyors Sand Conveyors Delta Phase[R] Shakeout No Bake Shakeouts\nBarrel Horse Shakeouts Attrition Mills / Lump Breakers Fluid Bed Sand Coolers\nVibro-Cool Sand Coolers\n\nAddress\n\nCarrier Vibrating Equipment, Inc.\n\n3400 Fern Valley Rd\n\nLouisville, KY 40213\n\nPh.: 502-969-3171\n\nFax: 502-969-3172\n\n[cve@carriervibrating.com](mailto:cve@carriervibrating.com)\n\n[www.carriervibrating.com](http://www.carriervibrating.com)",

    "html": "<p>Since its origin in 1950, Carrier has been recognized as the\nindustry leader in designing and building foundry equipment. Our unique\ncapabilities have served metalcasters around the world longer than any\nother full-line vibrating equipment manufacturer. Leaders in innovation,\nholding multiple patents, Carrier specializes in state-of-the-art\napplied technology for the most efficient and reliable foundry equipment\navailable to meet the industry's needs.</p>\n\n<p>Unique Solutions for the Foundry Industry</p>\n\n<p>Conveyors and Feeders: Carriers Natural-Frequency vibrating\nequipment utilizes a drive tuned in resonance with the spring-supported\nweight system. Most of the force required to vibrate the trough is\nalternatively stored and released by springs. Power requirements are\nminimal.</p>\n\n<p>Fluid Bed Sand Coolers: Carrier's patented fluidizing drilled\ndecks evenly distribute air into the sand bed, preventing hole pluggage\nand maximizing thermal efficiency. Air volume controls regulate and\nmaintain supply and exhaust air volumes at a constant preset level. A\nspecial hood design minimizes dusting and produces more uniform exhaust\nvelocities. The result is consistent return sand temperature and\nmoisture content.</p>\n\n<p>Delta-Phase[R] Shakeouts: The Delta-Phase[R] Shakeout improves\nfoundry profitability by reducing maintenance costs, eliminating or\nreducing casting damage, and maximizing sand removal. The heart of the\nDelta Phase[R] Shakeout is the process controller. Through precise\nvibration angle control, the Delta-Phase[R] Shakeout allows the operator\nto manage the conveying speed and retention time of castings on the\nshakeout deck-optimizing sand removal.</p>\n\n<p>Barrel Horse [TM] Shakeouts: The Barrel Horse Sand and Casting\nProcessor is a proven one-step solution to casting damage and sand mix\nproblems. Unlike conventional rotary shakeouts that lift and drop\ncastings, the Barrel Horse action allows castings to swim in the sand,\nconstantly blending via vibratory motion. Through this agitation and\nmixing method, castings are gently cleaned, excellent heat transfer\noccurs for a cooler casting, and sand lumps are reduced for homogeneous\nreturn sand.</p>\n\n<p>Company Executive <person>Chuck Mitchell</person> Vice President of Sales</p>\n\n<p>Vibrating <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1925462532\">Equipment, Inc.</org></p>\n\n<p>Mission Statement</p>\n\n<p>Carrier's purpose and employee charge is to design and\nfabricate innovative process machinery solutions that exceed customer\nexpectations.
