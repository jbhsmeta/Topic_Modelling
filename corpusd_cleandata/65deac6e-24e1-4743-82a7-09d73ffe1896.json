    "text": "Protests and riots continue across the country in response to police brutality\nagainst African Americans. In New Jersey, largely peaceful protests have\noccurred across the state from Trenton to Newark, with local officers marching\nwith protesters against police violence in some municipalities.\n\nMayor Brian P. Stack and Union City Chief of Police Nichelle Luster offered\ntheir condolences concerning the May 25 death of George Floyd.\n\nFloyd was an unarmed African-American man who was killed in Minneapolis when\npolice officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine\nminutes.\n\nFloyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with\nmurder and manslaughter.\n\nMayor Stack said that the unjust death of George Floyd at the hands of police\nofficers is a solemn reminder of how our society fails certain portions of the\npopulation.\n\n\"The tragic death of Mr. George Floyd represents a complete breakdown of what\nour country was founded upon. It serves as a painful reminder of the failings\nof our society and demands for us to do better,\" Mayor Stack said.\n\n\"The base of our democracy depends on our ability to change the narrative\nabout race in this country and to bring justice to those who have been\ndiscriminated against by those who swore to serve and protect them.\"\n\nOver the last few months, the \"new normal\" from the COVID-19 pandemic has\nplaced a tremendous amount of stress upon everyone. But, in difficult times,\nMayor Stack said that Union City has always stood together in solidarity as\none community.\n\nStack, who is also Union City's police director, said that if there is change\nin the local community prompted from Floyd's death, it should be done\ntogether, hand-in-hand with the police.\n\n\"It is my hope that these horrific events do not drive a wedge between the\nrelationships the police department have with the community,\" Stack continued.\n\"If we are going create change for the betterment of Union City, we must do so\ntogether.\"\n\nTo actually serve and protect\n\nChief Luster offered her condolences for George Floyd, saying that she was\ndeeply saddened and disturbed by the events in Minneapolis. Luster said that\nthe actions that resulted in the death of Mr. George Floyd are contrary to New\nJersey police training standards and contrary to New Jersey law.\n\n\"The conduct of that former officer erodes the trust that we work so hard to\nestablish within our communities and mars the reputation of hard-working law-\nenforcement professionals everywhere,\" Chief Luster said.\n\nPolice officers have a duty and a responsibility to serve with compassion,\nproficiency and respect and, according to Luster, anything less is\nunacceptable. Despite the unrest across the country, Luster said she is proud\nof the relationship the department has with their residents in Union City.\n\n\"Only through partnership, communication, constructive criticism, and\nunderstanding of individual differences, can we be successful,\" Luster said.\n\"My heartfelt thanks go out to the Union City community for your continued\nsupport.\"\n\nFor updates on this and other stories, check\n[www.hudsonreporter.com](http://www.hudsonreporter.com) and follow us on\nTwitter @hudson_reporter.

    "html": "<p>Protests and riots continue across the country in response to police brutality against African Americans. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, largely peaceful protests have occurred across the state from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.newark\">Newark</location>, with local officers marching with protesters against police violence in some municipalities.</p>\n<p>Mayor <person>Brian P. Stack</person> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.uniity\">Union City</location> Chief of Police <person>Nichelle Luster</person> offered their condolences concerning the <chron>May 25</chron> death of <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd was an unarmed <org>African-American</org> man who was killed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> when police officer <person>Derek Chauvin</person> held his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd was later pronounced dead. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor Stack said that the unjust death of <person>George Floyd</person> at the hands of police officers is a solemn reminder of how our society fails certain portions of the population.</p>\n\n<p>\"The tragic death of Mr. <person>George Floyd</person> represents a complete breakdown of what our country was founded upon. It serves as a painful reminder of the failings of our society and demands for us to do better,\" Mayor Stack said.</p>\n\n<p>\"The base of our democracy depends on our ability to change the narrative about race in this country and to bring justice to those who have been discriminated against by those who swore to serve and protect them.\"</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few months, the \"new normal\" from the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a tremendous amount of stress upon everyone. But, in difficult times, Mayor Stack said that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.uniity\">Union City</location> has always stood together in solidarity as one community.</p>\n\n<p>Stack, who is also <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.uniity\">Union City's</location> police director, said that if there is change in the local community prompted from Floyd's death, it should be done together, hand-in-hand with the police.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is my hope that these horrific events do not drive a wedge between the relationships the police department have with the community,\" Stack continued. \"If we are going create change for the betterment of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.uniity\">Union City</location>, we must do so together.\"</p>\n\n<p>To actually serve and protect</p>\n\n<p><person>Chief Luster</person> offered her condolences for <person>George Floyd</person>, saying that she was deeply saddened and disturbed by the events in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location>. Luster said that the actions that resulted in the death of Mr. <person>George Floyd</person> are contrary to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> police training standards and contrary to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> law.</p>\n\n<p>\"The conduct of that former officer erodes the trust that we work so hard to establish within our communities and mars the reputation of hard-working law-enforcement professionals everywhere,\" <person>Chief Luster</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>Police officers have a duty and a responsibility to serve with compassion, proficiency and respect and, according to Luster, anything less is unacceptable. Despite the unrest across the country, Luster said she is proud of the relationship the department has with their residents in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.uniity\">Union City</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Only through partnership, communication, constructive criticism, and understanding of individual differences, can we be successful,\" Luster said. \"My heartfelt thanks go out to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.uniity\">Union City</location> community for your continued support.\"</p>\n\n<p>For updates on this and other stories, check <a href=\"http://www.hudsonreporter.com\">www.hudsonreporter.com</a> and follow us on Twitter @hudson_reporter. <person>Daniel Israel</person> can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:disrael@hudsonreporter.com\">disrael@hudsonreporter.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The post <org>Mayor Stack and Union City Police</org> Chief respond to the death of <person>George Floyd</person> appeared first on <org>Hudson Reporter</org>.</p>",
