    "text": "In India, the annual economic loss resulting from tuberculosis (TB) is US $3\nbillion (1). Those in the economically productive age group (15-54 years)\naccount for >70% of the total burden (1). Incidence of multidrug-resistant TB\n(MDR TB) is higher in India than anywhere else in the world; [approximately\nequal to] 99,000 new cases of MDR TB occur in India each year (1). Treatment\nof MDR TB is more complex, challenging, and costly to manage than that of\ndrug-sensitive TB (2-4). In India, MDR TB is treated free of cost through\nprogrammatic management of drug-resistant TB (PMDT) under the National\nTuberculosis Elimination Programme (5). However, most patients seek healthcare\nfrom the private sector and some resort to alternative forms of medicine,\noften preferring self-medication and consulting quacks over visiting the PMDT\ncenter (6,7). This behavior not only results in delayed diagnosis but also\nincreases prediagnostic expenses (7). Increased expenses accompanied with loss\nof wages can compel patients and their families affected by TB to borrow\nmoney, take loans, or even sell their assets, thereby accentuating any\nexisting financial crises in the family (6-9). Hence, we estimated the direct\nand indirect out-of-pocket expenses incurred for diagnosis and pretreatment\nevaluation by presumptive MDR TB patients in Mangalore, India.\n\nThe Study\n\nMangalore is a coastal city in the state of Karnataka, India. The state has 6\nPMDT centers. Presumptive MDR TB patients, when referred to PMDT centers, are\nsubjected to drug sensitivity testing, preferably by use of a rapid molecular\ntest (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification assay), line probe assay, or\nculture, per PMDT guidelines (10). Those with an MDR TB diagnosis are admitted\nto the center for a week for pretreatment evaluation. All services provided\nunder PMDT are free of cost to the patient (10).\n\nWe included in our study all adults (>15 years of age) with MDR TB who were\nregistered under PMDT during August 2016-April 2017. By using a valid,\npretested, semistructured tool, we interviewed patients about various costs\nincurred by themselves, their families, or both, from the time they became a\npresumptive MDR TB patient until they underwent pretreatment evaluation at\nPMDT. Information about various costs reported by patients was validated with\nbills, if available. We used the following cost categories: direct medical,\ndirect nonmedical, indirect, and coping. Direct medical costs are expenses\nincurred during diagnosis and treatment of illness; direct nonmedical costs\nare costs of food, accommodations, and additional nutrition/supplements;\nindirect costs are the loss of wages because of illness; and coping costs are\nthe costs of coping mechanisms (assets sold, school dropouts, loans, and money\nborrowed) (Appendix,\n<https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/26/5/18-1992-App1.pdf>). Of the 40 MDR TB\npatients, the 16 who were admitted during the study period were interviewed in\nperson and the 24 who continued home-based treatment were interviewed by\ntelephone (Figure 1). Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional\nEthics Committee of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, and the Ethics\nAdvisory Group of The International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung\nDisease, Paris, France.\n\nData were double entered in EpiData version 3.1 software\n(<https://www.epidata.dk>) and analyzed by using SPSS Statistics 25.0\n(<https://www.ibm.com>) and EpiData analysis 2.2.2.183 software. Direct and\nindirect costs were summarized as median and interquartile ranges (IQRs).\nCategorical variables were expressed in proportions. Costs were collected by\nusing Indian rupees (INR) converted to United States dollars (USD) based on\nthe 2016 conversion rate (1 USD = 66.3731 INR). To compare the costs across\ndifferent countries, we first converted the reported costs (USD) from other\nstudies to local currency for the reported year, then adjusted them for\ninflation year by year until 2016 (11). Then we converted the costs back to\nUSD by using the 2016 conversion rate (Appendix).\n\nWe included 40 of the 63 registered patients in the study. Median (IQR) age of\nparticipants was 39 (2950) years. Most patients were male (28, 70%), and most\nlived in rural areas (28, 70%). Median (IQR) reported patient family income\nwas $608 ($228-$912)/year. Of the 40 patients, 39 (97%) had pulmonary MDR TB\nand 24 (60%) had approached the private healthcare sector for their first\nclinical encounter (Table 1; Figure 2).\n\nThe median (IQR) pretreatment out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients were\n$171 ($72-$432) total, $105 ($49-$306) direct, and $51 ($2-$306) indirect.\nWithin direct costs, direct nonmedical costs ($51) were more than direct\nmedical costs ($37). Of the direct nonmedical costs, most was spent on food\n($35). Most of the direct medical costs were for diagnostic investigation\n($18) and treatment ($15) (Table 2).\n\nThe median total pretreatment out-of-pocket expense incurred by patients in\nour study is similar to that found in a study in Peru ($210) after adjusting\nfor inflation rate and cost conversion (12). The median direct out-of-pocket\nexpenses are higher than the adjusted cost values found in previous comparable\nstudies conducted in Ethiopia ($87), Indonesia ($47), and Peru ($67) and lower\nthan that reported from Cambodia ($144) (12-15).\n\nThe median indirect out-of-pocket expense incurred by patients in India was\n$51 ($2-$306). This finding contrasts with those of studies in Ethiopia and\nIndonesia, where indirect pretreatment costs after adjustment for annual\ninflation were substantially lower (Ethiopia $9, Indonesia $8) (15).\n\nIn contrast, for patients in Ecuador, the adjusted direct out-of-pocket\nexpenses were 5 times greater than those for patients in India ($105 vs.\n$549). The adjusted indirect expenses were 10 times greater ($51 vs. $578)\n(12) (Appendix Table).\n\nIn addition, 18 (45%) patients in the study lost their job because of the\ndisease and had to borrow money for disease management and daily household\nneeds before receiving accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The\npercentages of persons with job losses were substantially lower than those\nreported for Peru (90%) and Ethiopia (72%) but similar to those for Indonesia\n(53%) (12,15).\n\nMedian coping cost incurred by patients in the study was $640 ($324-$1,360).\nWingfield et al. reported a median debt of $435 and a loss of income of $2,450\nbefore diagnosis for patients in Peru (12). In the study cohort, total median\ncost was $171 ($72-$432), which amounted to 28% of median total family income\n($608). This expense, when combined with a coping cost of $640, resulted in a\nfinancial burden that was 1.25 times greater than the median total family\nincome of the cohort ($608). Also, the cost of disease was $811 (sum of total\nmedian cost and median coping cost), and coping costs accounted for 79% of the\ntotal. Coping cost in a study conducted in Ecuador was as high as 7 times the\naverage annual income (14).\n\nIn our study, no patients reported school dropouts or separation in families.\nNone of the patients reported selling assets such as property, gold, and other\nvaluables. A total of 27 (67.5%) of the patients, approximately two thirds,\nhad already incurred catastrophic expenses before they were registered for MDR\nTB treatment.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur study appraised the costs expended by MDR TB patients from a single PMDT\ncenter. Determination of a complete estimate of costs borne by all MDR TB\npatients in India would require a comprehensive study conducted at the\ncommunity level and inclusion of patients receiving treatment from the public\nand private healthcare sectors.\n\nNew strategies that systematically engage private providers are needed to\nreduce the cost burden surrounding diagnosis for vulnerable patients. The\ngovernment of India may consider widening the spectrum of free services before\npatient enrollment in a government-monitored treatment program channeled\nthrough the private sector.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge John E.

    "title": "Pretreatment Out-of-Pocket Expenses for Presumptive Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients, India, 2016-2017.(DISPATCHES)",
    "html": "<p>In India, the annual economic loss resulting from tuberculosis (TB)\nis US <money>$3 billion</money> (1). Those in the economically productive age group\n(15-54 years) account for &gt;70% of the total burden (1). Incidence of\nmultidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is higher in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> than anywhere else in\nthe world; [approximately equal to] 99,000 new cases of MDR TB occur in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> each year (1). Treatment of MDR TB is more complex, challenging,\nand costly to manage than that of drug-sensitive TB (2-4). In India, MDR\nTB is treated free of cost through programmatic management of\ndrug-resistant TB (PMDT) under the National Tuberculosis Elimination\nProgramme (5). However, most patients seek healthcare from the private\nsector and some resort to alternative forms of medicine, often\npreferring self-medication and consulting quacks over visiting the PMDT\ncenter (6,7). This behavior not only results in delayed diagnosis but\nalso increases prediagnostic expenses (7). Increased expenses\naccompanied with loss of wages can compel patients and their families\naffected by TB to borrow money, take loans, or even sell their assets,\nthereby accentuating any existing financial crises in the family (6-9).\nHence, we estimated the direct and indirect out-of-pocket expenses\nincurred for diagnosis and pretreatment evaluation by presumptive MDR TB\npatients in Mangalore, India.</p>\n\n<p>The Study</p>\n\n<p>Mangalore is a coastal city in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/in.ka\">state of Karnataka, India</location>. The\nstate has 6 PMDT centers. Presumptive MDR TB patients, when referred to\nPMDT centers, are subjected to drug sensitivity testing, preferably by\nuse of a rapid molecular test (cartridge-based nucleic acid\namplification assay), line probe assay, or culture, per PMDT guidelines\n(10). Those with an MDR TB diagnosis are admitted to the center for a\nweek for pretreatment evaluation. All services provided under PMDT are\nfree of cost to the patient (10).</p>\n\n<p>We included in our study all adults (&gt;15 years of age) with MDR\nTB <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> were registered under PMDT during August 2016-April 2017. By\nusing a valid, pretested, semistructured tool, we interviewed patients\nabout various costs incurred by themselves, their families, or both,\nfrom the time they became a presumptive MDR TB patient until they\nunderwent pretreatment evaluation at PMDT. Information about various\ncosts reported by patients was validated with bills, if available. We\nused the following cost categories: direct medical, direct nonmedical,\nindirect, and coping. Direct medical costs are expenses incurred during\ndiagnosis and treatment of illness; direct nonmedical costs are costs of\nfood, accommodations, and additional nutrition/supplements; indirect\ncosts are the loss of wages because of illness; and coping costs are the\ncosts of coping mechanisms (assets sold, school dropouts, loans, and\nmoney borrowed) (Appendix,\n<a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/26/5/18-1992-App1.pdf\">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/26/5/18-1992-App1.pdf</a>). Of the 40 MDR\nTB patients, the 16 <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> were admitted during the study period were\ninterviewed in person and the 24 <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> continued home-based treatment were\ninterviewed by telephone (Figure 1). Ethics approval was obtained from\nthe <org>Institutional Ethics Committee of Kasturba Medical College</org>,\nMangalore, and the Ethics Advisory Group of The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2457950433\">International Union\nagainst Tuberculosis and Lung Disease</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/fr..paris\">Paris, France</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Data were double entered in EpiData version 3.1 software\n(<a href=\"https://www.epidata.dk\">https://www.epidata.dk</a>) and analyzed by using SPSS Statistics 25.0\n(<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com\">https://www.ibm.com</a>) and EpiData analysis 2.2.2.183 software. Direct\nand indirect costs were summarized as median and interquartile ranges\n(IQRs). Categorical variables were expressed in proportions. Costs were\ncollected by using Indian rupees (INR) converted to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">United States</location>\ndollars (USD) based on the 2016 conversion rate (<money>1 USD</money> = 66.3731 INR).\nTo compare the costs across different countries, we first converted the\nreported costs (USD) from other studies to local currency for the\nreported year, then adjusted them for inflation year by year until 2016\n(11). Then we converted the costs back to USD by using the 2016\nconversion rate (Appendix).</p>\n\n<p>We included 40 of the 63 registered patients in the study. Median\n(IQR) age of participants was 39 (2950) years. Most patients were male\n(28, 70%), and most lived in rural areas (28, 70%). Median (IQR)\nreported patient family income was <money>$608</money> (<money>$228-$912</money>)/year. Of the 40\npatients, 39 (97%) had pulmonary MDR TB and 24 (60%) had approached the\nprivate healthcare sector for their first clinical encounter (Table 1;\nFigure 2).</p>\n\n<p>The median (IQR) pretreatment out-of-pocket expenses incurred by\npatients were <money>$171</money> (<money>$72-$432</money>) total, <money>$105</money> (<money>$49-$306</money>) direct, and <money>$51</money>\n(<money>$2-$306</money>) indirect. Within direct costs, direct nonmedical costs (<money>$51</money>)\nwere more than direct medical costs (<money>$37</money>). Of the direct nonmedical\ncosts, most was spent on food (<money>$35</money>). Most of the direct medical costs\nwere for diagnostic investigation (<money>$18</money>) and treatment (<money>$15</money>) (Table 2).</p>\n\n<p>The median total pretreatment out-of-pocket expense incurred by\npatients in our study is similar to that found in a study in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pe\">Peru</location> (<money>$210</money>)\nafter adjusting for inflation rate and cost conversion (12). The median\ndirect out-of-pocket expenses are higher than the adjusted cost values\nfound in previous comparable studies conducted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/et\">Ethiopia</location> (<money>$87</money>),\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location> (<money>$47</money>), and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pe\">Peru</location> (<money>$67</money>) and lower than that reported from\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kh\">Cambodia</location> (<money>$144</money>) (12-15).</p>\n\n<p>The median indirect out-of-pocket expense incurred by patients in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> was <money>$51</money> (<money>$2-$306</money>). This finding contrasts with those of studies in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/et\">Ethiopia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location>, where indirect pretreatment costs after\nadjustment for annual inflation were substantially lower (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/et\">Ethiopia</location> <money>$9</money>,\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location> <money>$8</money>) (15).</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, for patients in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ec\">Ecuador</location>, the adjusted direct\nout-of-pocket expenses were 5 times greater than those for patients in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> (<money>$105</money> vs. <money>$549</money>). The adjusted indirect expenses were 10 times\ngreater (<money>$51</money> vs. <money>$578</money>) (12) (Appendix Table).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, 18 (45%) patients in the study lost their job because\nof the disease and had to borrow money for disease management and daily\nhousehold needs before receiving accurate diagnosis and appropriate\ntreatment. The percentages of persons with job losses were substantially\nlower than those reported for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pe\">Peru</location> (90%) and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/et\">Ethiopia</location> (72%) but similar\nto those for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location> (53%) (12,15).</p>\n\n<p>Median coping cost incurred by patients in the study was <money>$640</money>\n(<money>$324-$1,360</money>). Wingfield et al. reported a median debt of <money>$435</money> and a\nloss of income of <money>$2,450</money> before diagnosis for patients in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/pe\">Peru</location> (12). In\nthe study cohort, total median cost was <money>$171</money> (<money>$72-$432</money>), which amounted\nto 28% of median total family income (<money>$608</money>). This expense, when combined\nwith a coping cost of <money>$640</money>, resulted in a financial burden that was 1.25\ntimes greater than the median total family income of the cohort (<money>$608</money>).\nAlso, the cost of disease was <money>$811</money> (sum of total median cost and median\ncoping cost), and coping costs accounted for 79% of the total. Coping\ncost in a study conducted in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ec\">Ecuador</location> was as high as 7 times the average\nannual income (14).</p>\n\n<p>In our study, no patients reported school dropouts or separation in\nfamilies. None of the patients reported selling assets such as property,\ngold, and other valuables. A total of 27 (67.5%) of the patients,\napproximately two thirds, had already incurred catastrophic expenses\nbefore they were registered for MDR TB treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusions</p>\n\n<p>Our study appraised the costs expended by MDR TB patients from a\nsingle PMDT center. Determination of a complete estimate of costs borne\nby all MDR TB patients in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> would require a comprehensive study\nconducted at the community level and inclusion of patients receiving\ntreatment from the public and private healthcare sectors.</p>\n\n<p>New strategies that systematically engage private providers are\nneeded to reduce the cost burden surrounding diagnosis for vulnerable\npatients. The government of India may consider widening the spectrum of\nfree services before patient enrollment in a government-monitored\ntreatment program channeled through the private sector.</p>\n\n<p>Acknowledgments</p>\n\n<p>We acknowledge <person>John E.
