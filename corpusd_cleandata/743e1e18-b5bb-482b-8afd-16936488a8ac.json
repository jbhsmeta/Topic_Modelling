(June 5, 2020) \u0096 On Monday the Carson City Library is\nreopening to the public with the hours of 1-6 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nCurbside pick-up service will continue to be available 10 a.m.-noon, Monday\nthrough Friday.\n\n\"We're thrilled to be able to welcome the community back to the library,\" said\nTod Colegrove, director of the Carson City Library. \"Because of the governor's\ndirective and to ensure everyone stays as safe as possible, we've had to limit\nhours and staffing. We'll also still have curbside pick-up for those who might\nbe hesitant to come into the public facility.\"\n\nWith the Summer Learning Challenge running June 13-July 31, families and\nstudents can also easily pick up their materials, Colegrove added.\n\nThose who head to the library won't find seating or the computer lab available\n- but visitors will find the results of rigorous deep cleaning and safe\nprocesses. Patrons can call the library at (775) 283-7590 or place holds\nonline to pick up items during open hours, and curbside pick-up appointments\ncan be made by phone or email\n([curbside@carsoncitylibrary.org](mailto:curbside@carsoncitylibrary.org)).\n\nThe library is presently keeping all events virtual as part of its phased\nreopening plan that works in sync with the state's. Virtual programs are\nlisted on the library's online calendar, and the virtual Summer Learning\nChallenge Kickoff will be live via Zoom at 11 a.m. on Saturday, June 13.\n\nPeople are encouraged to continue using ebooks and audiobooks from the\nlibrary's OverDrive collection.\n\n\"Our ebooks and audiobooks are being used at about 150% of their normal rate,\"\nColegrove added. \"And our virtual programs are seeing a lot of activity.\"\n\nAbout the Carson City Library\n\nThe library serves a city of more than 54,000 people and several outlying\ncommunities. As a center for knowledge and discovery, the library is committed\nto inspiring learning, facilitating connection and creating opportunity for\nits community. The library is a regional leader with its focus on workforce\nand STEM-skill development for all ages.
