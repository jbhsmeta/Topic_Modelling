    "text": "June 6, 2020, is the 76th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of France\nin 1944. Operation Overlord began with the landing of over 150,000 troops on\nthe beaches of Normandy. This quiz is therefore all about World War II.\n\nNew world order\n\n1 Veronica Lake was an American actress of the early 1940s, known for her\npeek-a-boo hairstyle. Why did she adopt a much shorter haircut during the war?\n\n2 Though his was actually a competing design that was never accepted, who\nfirst gave the fearsome German heavy tank The Tiger its name?\n\n3 Why did the British air ministry credit the success of its night fighter\nteam -- led by pilot John Cunningham (nicknamed 'Cat's Eyes') -- against\nGerman bombers to a diet of carrots, which, it claimed, improves night vision?\n\n4 On October 14, 1944, who committed suicide in the presence of General\nBurgdof after realising that he would be implicated in the plot to kill\nHitler. His suicide was hidden till the end of the war, until his widow\nfinally told the story.\n\n5 With which specific operation in December 1941 would you associate the names\nHiryu, Soryu, Akagi, Kaga, Zuikaku and Shokaku?\n\n6 Which epic war film was inspired by a mission involving Sergeant Frederick\nNiland in 1944?\n\n7 During WWII, what did the Americans refer to as 'Liberty Steak'?\n\n8 Where did the signing of the Japanese surrender take place, bringing the\nlong and costly war to a close?\n\n9 Bock's Car, named after its commander Frederick Bock, was one of two Allied\nwarplanes with a unique role in the war. Name the other -- a much more well-\nknown warplane -- and the reason for their infamy.\n\n10 Which European leader's surname entered the dictionary as a synonym for a\ntraitor after he actively collaborated with the Nazi leadership after his\ncountry's occupation?\n\nAnswers\n\n1 Her hairstyle was copied by many American women, and with the men at war,\nthere were far more of them working in factories, where long hair was a\ndangerous hazard. Lake was asked by the War Department to change her hairstyle\nand help bring shorter cuts in fashion.\n\n2 Ferdinand Porsche. His versions were converted into self-propelled guns\nnamed Elefants.\n\n3 The British had just start using radars, and wanted to deflect German\nsuspicions about their existence, so they came up with the theory of the\ncarrots helping night vision.\n\n4 Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox.\n\n5 These were the six Japanese aircraft carriers that launched the attack on\nPearl Harbour, bringing the US into the war. Four of these were sunk in the\nBattle of Midway.\n\n6Saving Private Ryan. Frederick was one of four Niland brothers and his other\nbrothers were assumed killed. Frederick was sent back to the US on what was\nreferred to as the \"Only Son\" or \"Sole-Surviving Son\" policy.\n\n7 Hamburgers. They wanted to avoid any German names.\n\n8 On the battleship USS Missouri.\n\n9 Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on\nHiroshima. Bock's Car dropped the bomb on Nagasaki a couple of days later.\n\n10 Vidkun Quisling, the Norwegian leader.\n\nJoy Bhattacharjya is a quizmaster;\n\nTwitter: @joybhattacharj",
