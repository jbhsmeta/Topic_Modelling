    "text": "Main themes on Russian Primetime TV news on NTV, Rossiya 1 and Channel One on\n4 June\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin took centre stage today owing to what Russian\nnetworks described as his prompt intervention to arrest the spread of\ncoronavirus in a Siberian region and launch a major clean-up operation\nfollowing a disastrous fuel spill near the Arctic city of Norilsk.\n'Environmental catastrophe' in the Arctic\n\nAll three channels led with the Norilsk fuel spill story and were upfront\nabout the extent of the damage.\n\nGazprom Media's NTV described the incident as a \"true environmental\ncatastrophe\".\n\nState-controlled Channel One TV used similar language, saying the damage was\n\"catastrophic\" and would take decades to undo. Its correspondent said the\nsight of the contaminated river was \"horrifying\".\n\nReports showed excerpts from yesterday's televised video call during which\nPutin upbraided officials for not reporting the incident and shifting\nresponsibility onto each other.\n\n\"Immediately\" after that meeting work began to stop contamination and start\nextracting the spillage from the water and soil, the viewers were told,\npraising Putin's personal role in handling the aftermath of the incident.\nPutin requests support for Transbaikal Territory\n\nThe main theme in tonight's coverage of coronavirus in Russia was President\nPutin's order to the Defence Ministry to send help to Transbaikal region,\nwhich has found itself in a difficult situation.\n\nChannel One praised what it described as the president's timely intervention\nin the outbreak in the southern Siberian region.\n\nVideo showed a column of army trucks setting off from neighbouring Buryatia.\nThey are carrying dozens of medics and \"most modern\" equipment, Channel One\nsaid.\n\nAll three channels reported the latest nationwide - and in some cases regional\n- numbers.\n\nHowever, while NTV said that Russia today recorded nearly 9,000 cases (the\nexact number was 8,831), Channel One's take was that the number of new cases\nhad stayed below the 10,000 mark for 20 days in a row.\n\nOfficial state Rossiya 1 said that \"overall the situation is stabilising\".\nRussians said backing constitutional amendments\n\nAll three channels reported on the state pollster VTsIOM's findings to the\neffect that two-thirds of Russians intend to go to the polls on 1 July when\namendments to the constitution allowing Vladimir Putin to seek two more terms\nin office will be put to a vote.\n\nOf them, about 60 per cent intend to vote yes, according to VTsIOM. The vast\nmajority of Russians reportedly think it will be safe to go to the polls\ndespite the pandemic. Thank you to US for ventilators\n\nRossiya 1 and Channel One praised the US for giving Russia another 150\nventilators.\n\nThe former pointed out that the ventilators came complete with manuals in\nRussian, and that the consumer watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, had already\nconfirmed they were of high quality.\n\nRossiya 1 said the US sent the aid \"remembering\" that the Russians had helped\nthe Americans at their time of need.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was shown saying that this is an\n\"excellent example of cooperation\" between the two countries in times of\ntrouble.\n\nChannel One said Russia and the US had mounted a united front against the\npandemic.\n\nThe delivery of US ventilators is a \"valued gesture\", it said. Trump\n'disingenuous', Johnson 'ready for global effort'\n\nNTV was critical of Donald Trump and complimentary of Boris Johnson in a\nreport about today's online Global Vaccine Summit 2020, which was hosted by\nthe UK.\n\nIt appeared to accuse Trump of hypocrisy, saying he sounded disingenuous when\nspeaking about partnership. Johnson on the other hand is, it appears, ready to\nback a global effort in developing coronavirus vaccines, the TV's\ncorrespondent said.\n\nThe report also said that there was particular interest in Russian studies\nbecause they had \"real schedules\". US protests 'more peaceful', but\nadministration and country said divided\n\nAll three channels continued to cover the protests in the US sparked by the\nkilling by a white police officer of a black man.\n\nThe thrust of reports was different however.\n\nNTV said that while protests continued across much of America they had\ndefinitely become more peaceful with no major clashes occurring over the past\n24 hours.\n\nRossiya 1 and Channel One highlighted divisions between Donald Trump and his\nsenior officials, and between Washington and states. Channel One also said the\nDemocrats were seeking to use the protests to their advantage in the\npresidential election.\n\nRossiya 1 pointed out apparent divisions between Trump and his defence\nsecretary.\n\nChannel One presenter Kirill Kleymyonov blamed Democrats for the riots saying\nthe worst instances of disorder occurred in states run by Democratic\ngovernors.\n\nHe also accused Democrats of resorting to \"theatrics\" in expressing their\nsolidarity with the protesters.\n\nHe said America's separation of powers had proved to be its weakness, not\nstrength. He also appeared to accuse the National Guard of weakness.\n\n\"This picture is a symbol\" of the state of America, he said over an image of\nits members taking a knee with protesters.\n\nWe do not have this and I hope we shall never have, he said. US racism 'built\nin UK'\n\nChannel One presenter Kirill Kleymyonov took another swipe at the West when\ncommenting on protests in Europe.\n\n\"This is probably called trans-Atlantic solidarity. It is now clear what this\nphrase means,\" he said.\n\nChannel One said racism was an issue in Britain as much as in America.\n\nIts UK correspondent highlighted an opinion piece in The Guardian which said\nthat \"the racism that killed George Floyd was built in Britain\".\n\nOver footage of the protest in London the correspondent said that \"these\npeople's slogan is 'Britain is not innocent'\",\n\nSource: BBC Monitoring in Russian 1900 gmt 4 Jun 20",

    "html": "<block>\n<p>Main themes on Russian Primetime TV news on <org>NTV</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0269483980\">Rossiya</org> 1 and Channel One on 4 June</p>\n\n<p>President <person>Vladimir Putin</person> took centre stage today owing to what Russian networks described as his prompt intervention to arrest the spread of coronavirus in a Siberian region and launch a major clean-up operation following a disastrous fuel spill near <location>the Arctic</location> city of Norilsk.\n'Environmental catastrophe' in <location>the Arctic</location></p>\n<p>\nAll three channels led with the Norilsk fuel spill story and were upfront about the extent of the damage.</p>\n<p>Gazprom Media's <org>NTV</org> described the incident as a \"true environmental catastrophe\".</p>\n<p>State-controlled Channel One TV used similar language, saying the damage was \"catastrophic\" and would take decades to undo. Its correspondent said the sight of the contaminated river was \"horrifying\".</p>\n<p>Reports showed excerpts from yesterday's televised video call during which Putin upbraided officials for not reporting the incident and shifting responsibility onto each other.</p>\n<p>\"Immediately\" after that meeting work began to stop contamination and start extracting the spillage from the water and soil, the viewers were told, praising Putin's personal role in handling the aftermath of the incident.\nPutin requests support for Transbaikal Territory</p>\n<p>\nThe main theme in tonight's coverage of coronavirus in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> was <person>President Putin's</person> order to the <org>Defence Ministry</org> to send help to Transbaikal region, which has found itself in a difficult situation.</p>\n<p>Channel One praised what it described as the president's timely intervention in the outbreak in the southern Siberian region.</p>\n<p>Video showed a column of army trucks setting off from neighbouring Buryatia. They are carrying dozens of medics and \"most modern\" equipment, Channel One said.</p>\n<p>All three channels reported the latest nationwide - and in some cases regional - numbers.</p>\n<p>However, while <org>NTV</org> said that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> today recorded nearly 9,000 cases (the exact number was 8,831), Channel One's take was that the number of new cases had stayed below the 10,000 mark for 20 days in a row.</p>\n<p>Official state <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0269483980\">Rossiya</org> 1 said that \"overall the situation is stabilising\".\nRussians said backing constitutional amendments</p>\n<p>\nAll three channels reported on the state pollster VTsIOM's findings to the effect that two-thirds of Russians intend to go to the polls on 1 July when amendments to the constitution allowing <person>Vladimir Putin</person> to seek two more terms in office will be put to a vote.</p>\n<p>Of them, about 60 per cent intend to vote yes, according to VTsIOM. The vast majority of Russians reportedly think it will be safe to go to the polls despite the pandemic.\nThank you to US for ventilators</p>\n<p>\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0269483980\">Rossiya</org> 1 and Channel One praised the US for giving <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> another 150 ventilators.</p>\n<p>The former pointed out that the ventilators came complete with manuals in Russian, and that the consumer watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, had already confirmed they were of high quality.</p>\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0269483980\">Rossiya</org> 1 said the US sent the aid \"remembering\" that the Russians had helped the Americans at their time of need.</p>\n<p><org>Foreign Ministry</org> spokeswoman <person>Maria Zakharova</person> was shown saying that this is an \"excellent example of cooperation\" between the two countries in times of trouble.</p>\n<p>Channel One said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> and the US had mounted a united front against the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The delivery of US ventilators is a \"valued gesture\", it said.\nTrump 'disingenuous', Johnson 'ready for global effort'</p>\n<p>\n<org>NTV</org> was critical of <person>Donald Trump</person> and complimentary of <person>Boris Johnson</person> in a report about today's online Global Vaccine Summit 2020, which was hosted by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>.</p>\n<p>It appeared to accuse Trump of hypocrisy, saying he sounded disingenuous when speaking about partnership. Johnson on the other hand is, it appears, ready to back a global effort in developing coronavirus vaccines, the TV's correspondent said.</p>\n<p>The report also said that there was particular interest in Russian studies because they had \"real schedules\".\nUS protests 'more peaceful', but administration and country said divided</p>\n<p>\nAll three channels continued to cover the protests in the US sparked by the killing by a white police officer of a black man.</p>\n<p>The thrust of reports was different however.</p>\n<p><org>NTV</org> said that while protests continued across much of America they had definitely become more peaceful with no major clashes occurring over the past 24 hours.</p>\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0269483980\">Rossiya</org> 1 and Channel One highlighted divisions between <person>Donald Trump</person> and his senior officials, and between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington</location> and states. Channel One also said the <org>Democrats</org> were seeking to use the protests to their advantage in the presidential election.</p>\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0269483980\">Rossiya</org> 1 pointed out apparent divisions between Trump and his defence secretary.</p>\n<p>Channel One presenter Kirill Kleymyonov blamed <org>Democrats</org> for the riots saying the worst instances of disorder occurred in states run by Democratic governors.</p>\n<p>He also accused <org>Democrats</org> of resorting to \"theatrics\" in expressing their solidarity with the protesters.</p>\n<p>He said America's separation of powers had proved to be its weakness, not strength. He also appeared to accuse the <org>National Guard of</org> weakness.</p>\n<p>\"This picture is a symbol\" of the state of America, he said over an image of its members taking a knee with protesters.</p>\n<p>We do not have this and I hope we shall never have, he said.\nUS racism 'built in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>'</p>\n<p>\nChannel One presenter Kirill Kleymyonov took another swipe at the West when commenting on protests in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>.</p>\n<p>\"This is probably called trans-<org>Atlantic</org> solidarity. It is now clear what this phrase means,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Channel One said racism was an issue in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">Britain</location> as much as in America.</p>\n<p>Its <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> correspondent highlighted an opinion piece in The Guardian which said that \"the racism that killed <person>George Floyd</person> was built in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">Britain</location>\".</p>\n<p>Over footage of the protest in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> the correspondent said that \"these people's slogan is '<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">Britain</location> is not innocent'\",</p>\n\n\n<p>\nSource: BBC Monitoring in Russian <chron>1900 gmt</chron> <chron>4 Jun 20</chron></p>\n</block>",
