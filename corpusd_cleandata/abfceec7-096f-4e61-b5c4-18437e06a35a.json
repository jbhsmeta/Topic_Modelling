    "text": "I am a great lover of plants which I believe to be the cornerstone of life on\nthis planet. However, fallopia japonica, or Japanese knotweed, is listed by\nthe World Conservation Union as one of the world's most invasive species.\n\nWikipedia notes that \"[t]he invasive root system and strong growth can damage\nconcrete foundations, buildings, flood defenses, roads, paving, retaining\nwalls, and architectural sites.\" It forms monocultures that completely exclude\nnative species and destroys habitats for local plants and animals and degrades\nwater quality.\n\nThe plant is a herbaceous perennial that is a member of the buckwheat family\nthat was introduced to the western world in the mid to late 1800s for its\nornamental value. In hindsight, no one should have introduced this plant. Its\nspread in the United Kingdom has been so pernicious that it is deemed a\n\"controlled waste\" which needs to be disposed of in accordance with law.\n\nIn the UK, knotweed disclosure is mandatory on all deeds of sale and one\ncannot obtain a mortgage if the plant is found within a certain number of\nmeters from a residence. Wikipedia notes that it cost 70 million pounds to\neradicate knotweed from 10 acres of the London 2012 Olympic Games velodrome\nand aquatic center.\n\nJapanese knotweed has become a fertile field of civil litigation in the UK\nwith buyers fighting sellers, homeowners fighting contractors and neighbors\nfighting neighbors (Henry Grabar, [Slate.com](http://Slate.com)).\n\nThe success of the plant is due to a number of factors. It can survive a wide\nrange of soil types, light (semi-shade and sun), pH and temperatures. It can\nsuppress the growth of competitor plants by releasing toxic chemicals.\nHowever, its most fundamental advantage is its rhizome system which can grow\n10 feet deep and 23 feet wide (Wikipedia).\n\n\"In addition, fragments of both stem and root material can sprout, giving rise\nto new plants or entire colonies. Knotweed rhizomes that have not been\ncompletely killed off may send up new shoots as many as three years later\n(Michigan Department of Natural Resources).\"\n\nAs you can imagine, it is difficult and perhaps almost impossible to get rid\nof this plant. The roots need to be killed, not an easy job given how wide and\ndeep they can be. And you need to get rid of every tiny bit. There should be\nlaws on controlling its disposal in New York State. Be a good neighbor and if\nyou are trying to get rid of it on your property, put it in black bags and\ntake it to be burned.\n\nOn a more positive note, while it is not clear that the benefits of the plant\noutweigh the disadvantages, there are healers who believe that the stronger\nthe plant, the stronger its medicine. Steve Brill, in \"Foraging New York,\"\nnotes that \"it may be helpful in Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer, Lyme\ndisease and osteoporosis, but research is still in its early days.\"\n\nJapanese knotweed is rich in resveratrol. Web MD says resveratrol \"has strong\nantioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In laboratory studies, it has\nprevented the kind of damage that can trigger the cancer process in cells.\"\n\nSome beekeepers value its late blooming flower as an important source of\nnectar for honeybees when little else is flowering. It is so fast growing it\nis being considered as a briquette biofuel. And it is edible.\n\nVictoria Quesada is a nature-study enthusiast from Hamilton.",

    "html": "<p>I am a great lover of plants which I believe to be the cornerstone of life on this planet. However, fallopia japonica, or Japanese knotweed, is listed by the <org>World Conservation Union</org> as one of the world's most invasive species.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia notes that \"[t]he invasive root system and strong growth can damage concrete foundations, buildings, flood defenses, roads, paving, retaining walls, and architectural sites.\" It forms monocultures that completely exclude native species and destroys habitats for local plants and animals and degrades water quality.</p>\n\n<p>The plant is a herbaceous perennial that is a member of the buckwheat family that was introduced to the western world in the mid to late 1800s for its ornamental value. In hindsight, no one should have introduced this plant. Its spread in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location> has been so pernicious that it is deemed a \"controlled waste\" which needs to be disposed of in accordance with law.</p>\n\n<p>In the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>, knotweed disclosure is mandatory on all deeds of sale and one cannot obtain a mortgage if the plant is found within a certain number of meters from a residence. Wikipedia notes that it cost 70 million pounds to eradicate knotweed from 10 acres of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> 2012 <org>Olympic Games</org> velodrome and aquatic center.</p>\n\n<p>Japanese knotweed has become a fertile field of civil litigation in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> with buyers fighting sellers, homeowners fighting contractors and neighbors fighting neighbors (<person>Henry Grabar</person>, <a href=\"http://Slate.com\">Slate.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The success of the plant is due to a number of factors. It can survive a wide range of soil types, light (semi-shade and sun), pH and temperatures. It can suppress the growth of competitor plants by releasing toxic chemicals. However, its most fundamental advantage is its rhizome system which can grow 10 feet deep and 23 feet wide (Wikipedia).</p>\n\n<p>\"In addition, fragments of both stem and root material can sprout, giving rise to new plants or entire colonies. Knotweed rhizomes that have not been completely killed off may send up new shoots as many as three years later (<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0479712284\">Michigan Department of Natural Resources</org>).\"</p>\n\n<p>As you can imagine, it is difficult and perhaps almost impossible to get rid of this plant. The roots need to be killed, not an easy job given how wide and deep they can be. And you need to get rid of every tiny bit. There should be laws on controlling its disposal in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ny\">New York State</location>. Be a good neighbor and if you are trying to get rid of it on your property, put it in black bags and take it to be burned.</p>\n\n<p>On a more positive note, while it is not clear that the benefits of the plant outweigh the disadvantages, there are healers who believe that the stronger the plant, the stronger its medicine. <person>Steve Brill</person>, in \"Foraging New York,\" notes that \"it may be helpful in Alzheimer's disease, prostate cancer, Lyme disease and osteoporosis, but research is still in its early days.\"</p>\n\n<p>Japanese knotweed is rich in resveratrol. Web MD says resveratrol \"has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In laboratory studies, it has prevented the kind of damage that can trigger the cancer process in cells.\"</p>\n\n<p>Some beekeepers value its late blooming flower as an important source of nectar for honeybees when little else is flowering. It is so fast growing it is being considered as a briquette biofuel. And it is edible.</p>\n\n<p><person>Victoria Quesada</person> is a nature-study enthusiast from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.halton\">Hamilton</location>.</p>",
