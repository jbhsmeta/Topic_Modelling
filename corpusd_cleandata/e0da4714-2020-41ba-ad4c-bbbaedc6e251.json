    "text": "When Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, the company's assigned goal was to get\nhumans into space.\n\nNow that NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley have made it aboard\nthe International Space Station, Musk is breathing a sigh of relief that his\ncompany's Crew Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket performed successfully\nduring this weekend mission. Now SpaceX can officially consider itself the\nfirst-ever company to send humans into orbit aboard a privately owned\nspacecraft.\n\nBut it's not over yet. Critical weeks of safety and technical reviews of the\nspacecraft lie ahead before NASA will officially designate Crew Dragon as an\n\"operational\" vehicle. Then, another Crew Dragon spacecraft must be deemed\nready for the next mission, dubbed Crew-1, that will carry four more\nastronauts to the space station: NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Michael\nHopkins, Shannon Walker and Japan's Soichi Noguchi.\n\nNASA is hoping to launch Crew-1 in August.\n\nThe mission Behnken and Hurley began over the weekend won't be considered a\nsuccess until they return safely to Earth, but their mission is expected to\nlast up to 110 days, and the journey home will be just as perilous as the ride\nto orbit.\n\nCrew Dragon's debut, however, is a significant milestone for SpaceX and NASA,\nand this mission was one of the biggest items both organizations needed to\ncheck off the list before turning to larger ambitions.\n\nAccess to the International Space Station\n\nThe United States hasn't launched its own astronauts into space since the\nSpace Shuttle program ended in 2011. Since then, NASA's astronauts have had to\ntravel to Russia and train on the country's Soyuz spacecraft. Those seats have\ncost NASA as much as $90 million each.\n\nBut the space agency chose not to create its own replacement for the Shuttle.\nInstead, it asked the private sector to develop a spacecraft capable of safely\nferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station \\- a\ncontroversial decision considering that NASA had never before outsourced the\ndevelopment of a human-rated spacecraft. The thinking was that companies could\ndrive down costs and spur innovation, and NASA would have more time and\nresources to focus on exploring deeper into the solar system.\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded two contracts: $4.2 billion to Boeing to build its\nStarliner vehicle, and $2.6 billion to SpaceX, which planned to create a crew-\nworthy version of the Dragon spacecraft that was already flying cargo to and\nfrom the International Space Station (ISS). NASA had already put money toward\nSpaceX's development of the Dragon spacecraft used for transporting cargo, and\nthe space agency has said Boeing received more money because it was designing\nthe Starliner from scratch.\n\nBoeing recently suffered a significant setback when a Starliner capsule\nmalfunctioned during a key uncrewed test flight. But if SpaceX can safely\nreturn Behnken and Hurley, it'll be a major win for NASA, which has been\npushing for more commercial partnerships.\n\nAt times, delays with development of both the Crew Dragon and Boeing's\nStarliner capsule have threatened to leave the U.S. portion of the ISS\nunderstaffed.\n\nBut, after years of anticipation, Crew Dragon capsules are poised to begin\nmaking regular trips to and from the space station, allowing NASA to take more\ncontrol over staffing the ISS. The space agency hopes to have more hands on\ndeck, creating more opportunities for conducting scientific experiments and\nmaintaining ISS operations.\n\nBecause the Crew Dragon program is technically owned and operated by SpaceX,\nthe company can even explore opportunities to take tourists or other non-\nastronauts to space.\n\nActor Tom Cruise, for example, is working with NASA to eventually film a movie\naboard the ISS, the space agency says.\n\nArtemis: NASA's next moon mission\n\nNASA's ambitions extend far beyond the ISS, which orbits about 250 miles above\nEarth.\n\nAnd last year, Vice President Mike Pence directed the space agency to\ndrastically accelerate its plan to return boots to the lunar surface by later\nthis decade. NASA is now pushing toward a 2024 deadline.\n\nSpaceX wound up being a part of that effort, called the Artemis Program, too.\nSpaceX proposed a new variant of its Dragon capsule, Dragon XL, that could\nhaul cargo all the way out to a space station that NASA planned to put in\norbit around the moon. And last month, SpaceX was among several companies\ntapped to develop lunar landers, or vehicles that can ferry astronauts from\nNASA's Orion spacecraft down to the lunar surface.\n\nFor the latter task, SpaceX proposed using the Starship system - a spaceship\nand rocket that the company is in the early stages of developing at remote\nfacilities in South Texas.\n\nMusk has spent a significant amount of time overseeing that work in Texas\nlately. And the latest iterations of Starship prototypes haven't survived very\nfar into the testing process.\n\nThe latest Starship test article, called SN4, exploded during ground tests in\nBoca Chica, Texas, last week.\n\nSpaceX's Mars ambitions\n\nMusk has given every indication that SpaceX will pour significant resources\ninto Starship development in the months and years ahead.\n\nThe company is building a multibilllion-dollar telecom business, Starlink,\nthat SpaceX hopes will help fund development of the Starship program, and the\ncompany continues to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from private\ninvestors.\n\nThe origin of Starship, after all, is not with NASA or its Artemis Program.\nStarship is at the core of SpaceX's stated founding mission to establish a\ncolony of humans on Mars.\n\nTechnologically speaking, that milestone is likely still a long way from\nreality.\n\nBut Musk, speaking to reporters after Saturday's Crew Dragon launch,\nreaffirmed his commitment to Mars as he breathlessly celebrated Hurley and\nBehnken's safe departure.\n\n\"I am sort of overcome by emotion. To try to come up with cohesive sentences\nthat make any sense is quite difficult,\" Musk said before adding, \"But I think\nthis is, hopefully, the first step on a journey towards civilization on on\nMars.\"",

    "html": "<p>When <person value=\"APIN:2621757612\">Elon Musk</person> founded <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> in 2002, the company's assigned goal was to get humans into space.</p>\n<p>Now that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> astronauts <person>Robert Behnken</person> and <person>Douglas Hurley</person> have made it aboard the <location>International Space Station</location>, Musk is breathing a sigh of relief that his company's <person>Crew Dragon</person> spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket performed successfully during this weekend mission. Now <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> can officially consider itself the first-ever company to send humans into orbit aboard a privately owned spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>But it's not over yet. Critical weeks of safety and technical reviews of the spacecraft lie ahead before <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> will officially designate <person>Crew Dragon</person> as an \"operational\" vehicle. Then, another <person>Crew Dragon</person> spacecraft must be deemed ready for the next mission, dubbed Crew-1, that will carry four more astronauts to the space station: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> astronauts <person>Victor Glover</person>, <person>Michael Hopkins</person>, <person>Shannon Walker</person> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan's</location> <person>Soichi Noguchi</person>.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> is hoping to launch Crew-1 in August.</p>\n\n<p>The mission Behnken and Hurley began over the weekend won't be considered a success until they return safely to Earth, but their mission is expected to last up to 110 days, and the journey home will be just as perilous as the ride to orbit.</p>\n\n<p><person>Crew Dragon's</person> debut, however, is a significant milestone for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>, and this mission was one of the biggest items both organizations needed to check off the list before turning to larger ambitions.</p>\n\n<p>Access to the <location>International Space Station</location></p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">The United States</location> hasn't launched its own astronauts into space since the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011. Since then, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>'s astronauts have had to travel to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location> and train on the country's Soyuz spacecraft. Those seats have cost <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> as much as <money>$90 million</money> each.</p>\n\n<p>But the space agency chose not to create its own replacement for the Shuttle. Instead, it asked the private sector to develop a spacecraft capable of safely ferrying astronauts to and from the <location>International Space Station</location> - a controversial decision considering that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> had never before outsourced the development of a human-rated spacecraft. The thinking was that companies could drive down costs and spur innovation, and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> would have more time and resources to focus on exploring deeper into the solar system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> awarded two contracts: <money>$4.2 billion</money> to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing</org> to build its Starliner vehicle, and <money>$2.6 billion</money> to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>, which planned to create a crew-worthy version of the Dragon spacecraft that was already flying cargo to and from the <location>International Space Station</location> (ISS). <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> had already put money toward <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>'s development of the Dragon spacecraft used for transporting cargo, and the space agency has said <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing</org> received more money because it was designing the Starliner from scratch.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing</org> recently suffered a significant setback when a Starliner capsule malfunctioned during a key uncrewed test flight. But if <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> can safely return Behnken and Hurley, it'll be a major win for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>, which has been pushing for more commercial partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>At times, delays with development of both the Crew Dragon and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing's</org> Starliner capsule have threatened to leave the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> portion of the ISS understaffed.</p>\n\n<p>But, after years of anticipation, <person>Crew Dragon</person> capsules are poised to begin making regular trips to and from the space station, allowing <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> to take more control over staffing the ISS. The space agency hopes to have more hands on deck, creating more opportunities for conducting scientific experiments and maintaining ISS operations.</p>\n\n<p>Because the Crew Dragon program is technically owned and operated by <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>, the company can even explore opportunities to take tourists or other non-astronauts to space.</p>\n\n<p>Actor <person>Tom Cruise</person>, for example, is working with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> to eventually film a movie aboard the ISS, the space agency says.</p>\n\n<p>Artemis: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>'s next moon mission</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>'s ambitions extend far beyond the ISS, which orbits about 250 miles above Earth.</p>\n\n<p>And last year, Vice President <person>Mike Pence</person> directed the space agency to drastically accelerate its plan to return boots to the lunar surface by later this decade. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> is now pushing toward a 2024 deadline.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> wound up being a part of that effort, called the Artemis Program, too. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> proposed a new variant of its Dragon capsule, Dragon XL, that could haul cargo all the way out to a space station that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> planned to put in orbit around the moon. And last month, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> was among several companies tapped to develop lunar landers, or vehicles that can ferry astronauts from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>'s Orion spacecraft down to the lunar surface.</p>\n\n<p>For the latter task, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> proposed using the Starship system - a spaceship and rocket that the company is in the early stages of developing at remote facilities in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">South Texas</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Musk has spent a significant amount of time overseeing that work in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> lately. And the latest iterations of Starship prototypes haven't survived very far into the testing process.</p>\n\n<p>The latest Starship test article, called SN4, exploded during ground tests in <person>Boca Chica</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>, last week.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>'s Mars ambitions</p>\n\n<p>Musk has given every indication that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> will pour significant resources into Starship development in the months and years ahead.</p>\n\n<p>The company is building a multibilllion-dollar telecom business, Starlink, that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> hopes will help fund development of the Starship program, and the company continues to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from private investors.</p>\n\n<p>The origin of Starship, after all, is not with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> or its Artemis Program. Starship is at the core of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>'s stated founding mission to establish a colony of humans on Mars.</p>\n\n<p>Technologically speaking, that milestone is likely still a long way from reality.</p>\n\n<p>But Musk, speaking to reporters after Saturday's <person>Crew Dragon</person> launch, reaffirmed his commitment to Mars as he breathlessly celebrated Hurley and Behnken's safe departure.</p>\n\n<p>\"I am sort of overcome by emotion. To try to come up with cohesive sentences that make any sense is quite difficult,\" Musk said before adding, \"But I think this is, hopefully, the first step on a journey towards civilization on on Mars.\"</p>",
