    "text": "Prague, June 5 (CTK) - The results of a research of a scientific team,\nincluding Czech experts, focusing on how a metal is formed have been published\nin the Science magazine, the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry\nof the Czech Academy of Sciences said in a press release sent to CTK.\n\n\"Hopefully, the present work on metallic ammonia will open the path to\nrealising our most 'explosive' idea: The preparation of metallic water by very\ncarefully mixing it with alkali metals,\" one of the Czech scientists, Pavel\nJungwirth, said.\n\nAmerican, Czech and German scientists tried to answer the simple question of\nhow exactly is a metallic conduction band formed from originally localised\nelectrons and what is the corresponding microscopic picture for the material\ninvolved.\n\nThey have succeeded in mapping the electrolyte-to-metal transition in alkali\nmetal at the molecular level. The metal were liquid ammonia solutions using a\ncombination of photoelectron spectroscopy and electronic structure\ncalculations.\n\nIt took several years to achieve this, Jungwirth told CTK.\n\nAlkali metals dissolved in liquid ammonia represent archetypal systems to\nexplore the transition from blue electrolytes at low concentrations to bronze\nor gold coloured metallic solutions with higher concentrations of excess\nelectrons.\n\nJungwirth said the whole research began with throwing sodium in water, which\nis something most people know from school chemistry lessons as an experiment\nthat shows how an explosion looks like.\n\n\"The trick we then did is that instead of water we used liquid ammonia, with\nwhich there is no explosion. And it is possible to add more and more alkali\nmetals,\" he said.\n\nJungwirth said the method of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) was used as the\nmaterial can be radiated and the electrons in it studied at the synchrotron in\nBerlin, which is a very strong source of X-rays.\n\nkva/dr/hol",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cz..prague\">Prague</location>, <chron>June 5</chron> (CTK) - The results of a research of a scientific team, including Czech experts, focusing on how a metal is formed have been published in the <org>Science magazine</org>, the <org>Institute of Organic Chemistry</org> and <org>Biochemistry of the Czech Academy</org> of Sciences said in a press release sent to CTK.</p>\n<p>\"Hopefully, the present work on metallic ammonia will open the path to realising our most 'explosive' idea: The preparation of metallic water by very carefully mixing it with alkali metals,\" one of the Czech scientists, <person>Pavel Jungwirth</person>, said.</p>\n<p>American, Czech and German scientists tried to answer the simple question of how exactly is a metallic conduction band formed from originally localised electrons and what is the corresponding microscopic picture for the material involved.</p>\n<p>They have succeeded in mapping the electrolyte-to-metal transition in alkali metal at the molecular level. The metal were liquid ammonia solutions using a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations.</p>\n<p>It took several years to achieve this, Jungwirth told CTK.</p>\n<p>Alkali metals dissolved in liquid ammonia represent archetypal systems to explore the transition from blue electrolytes at low concentrations to bronze or gold coloured metallic solutions with higher concentrations of excess electrons.</p>\n<p>Jungwirth said the whole research began with throwing sodium in water, which is something most people know from school chemistry lessons as an experiment that shows how an explosion looks like.</p>\n<p>\"The trick we then did is that instead of water we used liquid ammonia, with which there is no explosion. And it is possible to add more and more alkali metals,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Jungwirth said the method of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) was used as the material can be radiated and the electrons in it studied at the synchrotron in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">Berlin</location>, which is a very strong source of X-rays.</p>\n<p>kva/dr/hol</p>",
