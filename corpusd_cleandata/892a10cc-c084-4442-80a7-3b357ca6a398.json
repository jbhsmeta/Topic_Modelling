    "text": "Washington: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA has issued the\nfollowing order:\n\n1 PUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA UNITED STATES OF\nAMERICA, Plaintiff, v. MEMORANDUM OF LAW & ORDER Criminal File No. 11-87\n(MJD/HB) (1) JULIAN OKEAYAINNEH, Defendant. Allison Ethen, Assistant United\nStates Attorney, Counsel for Plaintiff. Julian Okeayainneh, pro se. This\nmatter is before the Court on Defendant Julian Okeayainneh's Pro Se Motion for\nCompassionate Release from Custody. [Docket No. 1302] Under the First Step\nAct, 18 U.S.C. SS 3582(c)(1)(A), the Court may, upon a defendant's motion\nfollowing exhaustion of administrative remedies or the lapse of 30 days from\nthe receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant's facility,\nwhichever is earlier, \"reduce the term of imprisonment (and may impose a term\nof probation or supervised release with or without conditions that does not\nexceed the unserved portion of the original term of imprisonment), after CASE\n0:11-cr-00087-MJD-HB Document 1308 Filed 05/26/20 Page 1 of 4 2 considering\nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are\napplicable, if it finds that-- (i) extraordinary and compelling reasons\nwarrant such a reduction . . . and that such a reduction is consistent with\napplicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" The Bureau\nof Prisons' (\"BOP\") Administrative Remedy Program is set forth in 28 CFR SS\n542.10 et seq. This program applies to all inmates under BOP responsibility\nand provides for a formal review of issues relating to any aspect of his\nconfinement. Id. SS 542.10 (a) and (b). Pursuant to these regulations, an\ninmate shall first raise an issue informally. Id., SS 542.13(a). If the inmate\ndid not resolve the issue informally, he may then file a formal Request to the\nWarden. Id. SS 542.14. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden's\ndecision at this stage, he may appeal the Warden's decision to the Regional\nDirector within 20 days of the Warden's signed response. Id. SS 542.15(a).\nSuch an appeal must be filed on the appropriate form (BP-10). Id. Finally, the\nRegional Director's decision may be appealed by filing a BP-11 form with the\nDirector of the National Inmate Appeals in the Office of the General Counsel.\nId. Before the Court can decide whether Defendant is entitled to compassionate\nrelease, he must first 1) exhaust administrative remedies as set CASE\n0:11-cr-00087-MJD-HB Document 1308 Filed 05/26/20 Page 2 of 4 3 forth in the\npreceding paragraph or 2) show that he made a request for compassionate\nrelease to the Warden and the Warden did not respond within 30 days. Defendant\nhas shown that he made a request for compassionate release to the Warden more\nthan 30 days ago. However, because Defendant filed his motion before 30 days\nhad passed after he submitted his request to the Warden, there is no evidence\nin the record regarding whether the Warden failed to respond within 30 days,\nor whether the Warden did respond, and Defendant appealed that decision\nadministratively. At this time, there is no proof that Defendant has exhausted\nadministrative remedies and Defendant has failed to show that exhaustion would\nbe futile, so the Court cannot rule on the merits of Defendant's motion. Thus,\nthe Court will stay Defendant's motion until such time as Defendant or the\nGovernment submits proof that he has exhausted administrative remedies.\nAccordingly, based upon the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS\nHEREBY ORDERED: CASE 0:11-cr-00087-MJD-HB Document 1308 Filed 05/26/20 Page 3\nof 4 4 Defendant Julian Okeayainneh's Pro Se Motion for Compassionate Release\nfrom Custody [Docket No. 1302] is STAYED until the Court is notified that\nDefendant has exhausted administrative remedies.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW &amp; ORDER Criminal File\nNo. 11-87 (MJD/HB) (1) JULIAN OKEAYAINNEH, Defendant. <person>Allison Ethen</person>,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Counsel for Plaintiff. Julian\nOkeayainneh, pro se. This matter is before the Court on Defendant <person>Julian\nOkeayainneh's</person> Pro <person>Se Motion</person> for Compassionate Release from Custody.\n[Docket No. 1302] Under the First Step Act, 18 U.S.C. SS 3582(c)(1)(A),\nthe Court may, upon a defendant's motion following exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such\na request by the warden of the defendant's facility, whichever is\nearlier, \"reduce the term of imprisonment (and may impose a term of\nprobation or supervised release with or without conditions that does not\nexceed the unserved portion of the original term of imprisonment), after\nCASE 0:11-cr-00087-MJD-HB Document 1308 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 1 of 4 2\nconsidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that\nthey are applicable, if it finds that-- (i) extraordinary and compelling\nreasons warrant such a reduction . . . and that such a reduction is\nconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the <org>Sentencing\nCommission</org>.\" <org>The Bureau of Prisons'</org> (\"BOP\")\nAdministrative Remedy Program is set forth in 28 CFR SS 542.10 et seq.\nThis program applies to all inmates under BOP responsibility and\nprovides for a formal review of issues relating to any aspect of his\nconfinement. Id. SS 542.10 (a) and (b). Pursuant to these regulations,\nan inmate shall first raise an issue informally. Id., SS 542.13(a). If\nthe inmate did not resolve the issue informally, he may then file a\nformal Request to the Warden. Id. SS 542.14. If the inmate is not\nsatisfied with the Warden's decision at this stage, he may appeal\nthe Warden's decision to the Regional Director within 20 days of\nthe Warden's signed response. Id. SS 542.15(a). Such an appeal must\nbe filed on the appropriate form (BP-10). Id. Finally, the Regional\nDirector's decision may be appealed by filing a BP-11 form with the\nDirector of the National Inmate Appeals in the <org>Office of the General\nCounsel</org>. Id. Before the Court can decide whether Defendant is entitled\nto compassionate release, he must first 1) exhaust administrative\nremedies as set CASE 0:11-cr-00087-MJD-HB Document 1308 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron>\nPage 2 of 4 3 forth in the preceding paragraph or 2) show that he made a\nrequest for compassionate release to the Warden and the Warden did not\nrespond within 30 days. Defendant has shown that he made a request for\ncompassionate release to the Warden more than 30 days ago. However,\nbecause Defendant filed his motion before 30 days had passed after he\nsubmitted his request to the Warden, there is no evidence in the record\nregarding whether the Warden failed to respond within 30 days, or\nwhether the Warden did respond, and Defendant appealed that decision\nadministratively. At this time, there is no proof that Defendant has\nexhausted administrative remedies and Defendant has failed to show that\nexhaustion would be futile, so the Court cannot rule on the merits of\nDefendant's motion. Thus, the Court will stay Defendant's\nmotion until such time as Defendant or the Government submits proof that\nhe has exhausted administrative remedies. Accordingly, based upon the\nfiles, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: CASE\n0:11-cr-00087-MJD-HB Document 1308 Filed <chron>05/26/20</chron> Page 3 of 4 4\nDefendant <person>Julian Okeayainneh's</person> Pro <person>Se Motion</person> for Compassionate\nRelease from Custody [Docket No. 1302] is STAYED until the Court is\nnotified that Defendant has exhausted administrative remedies.
