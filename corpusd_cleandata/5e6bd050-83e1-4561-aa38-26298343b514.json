    "text": "WAYLAND \\- The School Committee has voted unanimously to change name of the\nChristopher Columbus holiday weekend on the school calendar to Indigenous\nPeoples Day, following a move by other school boards including Somerville,\nCambridge and Brookline.\n\nSchool Committee member Nate Buffum said he hoped the entire town adopts the\nchange.\n\n\"I'm all for changing it,\" Buffum said. Fellow School Committee member Kim\nReichelt noted her vote was an \"enthusiastic yes.\"\n\nDuring the public comment portion of the School Committee meeting, which was\nheld remotely, resident Rebecca Smoler said: \"The holiday perpetuates the myth\nthat Columbus discovered America and erases the true history ... of the\ncolonialism, enslavement and genocide that occurred. Celebrating Columbus\nsends a message to our Wayland students and community that he's a hero, when\nin reality he is responsible for millions of deaths and has been labeled by\nhistorians as the father of the slave trade.\"\n\nSmoler said Indigenous peoples in Massachusetts have asked for this change,\nincluding the Massachusetts Center for Native American Awareness, and by\nhonoring the request, \"we celebrate Indigenous resilience and contributions\nand take a step toward reconciliation.\"\n\nShe added that continuing to honor Columbus Day is a disservice to Wayland\nchildren and the community \"because when we are ignorant of the oppression of\nthe Indigenous people, it is easy to remain ignorant of the racism and\ninjustice that Indigenous people continue to face today. Learning our\ncountry's history and acknowledging atrocities of the past not only is the\nright thing to do but is an opportunity to empower our children to be allies\nand advocates for justice.\"\n\nMichael Wyner can be reached at\n[mwyner@wickedlocal.com](mailto:mwyner@wickedlocal.com) or 508-626-4441.",

Celebrating Columbus sends a message to our <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.wayand\">Wayland</location> students and community that he's a hero, when in reality he is responsible for millions of deaths and has been labeled by historians as the father of the slave trade.\"</p>\n\n<p>Smoler said Indigenous peoples in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ma\">Massachusetts</location> have asked for this change, including the <org>Massachusetts Center for Native American Awareness</org>, and by honoring the request, \"we celebrate Indigenous resilience and contributions and take a step toward reconciliation.\"</p>\n\n<p>She added that continuing to honor <chron>Columbus Day</chron> is a disservice to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.wayand\">Wayland</location> children and the community \"because when we are ignorant of the oppression of the Indigenous people, it is easy to remain ignorant of the racism and injustice that Indigenous people continue to face today. Learning our country's history and acknowledging atrocities of the past not only is the right thing to do but is an opportunity to empower our children to be allies and advocates for justice.\"</p>\n\n<p>           <person>Michael Wyner</person> can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:mwyner@wickedlocal.com\">mwyner@wickedlocal.com</a> or 508-626-4441.</p>",
