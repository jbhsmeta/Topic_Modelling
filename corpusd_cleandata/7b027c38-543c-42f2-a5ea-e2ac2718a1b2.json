    "text": "Tropical storm conditions from Cristobal are likely to start Sunday in parts\nof southern Louisiana, forecasters said Friday morning.\n\nUpdate: Metro New Orleans under tropical storm watch ahead of Cristobal\n\nA tropical storm watch and a storm surge watch will likely be issued for a\nportion of the Gulf Coast later Friday.\n\nCristobal, which is currently over land in Mexico, is expected to move north\nthrough the Gulf of Mexico and make landfall along Louisiana's central coast\nlate Sunday night or early Monday.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards has issued an emergency declaration for the state in\nadvance of the storm.\n\nA flood watch is in effect for most of southeast Louisiana through 7 a.m.\nTuesday, and forecasters issued a tropical storm watch Friday morning for some\nof Louisiana's coastal waters.\n\nWhere is Tropical Storm Cristobal?\n\nAs of 4 a.m. Friday, Cristobal was over land about 80 miles southeast of\nCampeche, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said. It had sustained winds\nof 35 mph.\n\nIt has completed a slow loop and is heading northeast at 7 mph, forecasters\nsaid.\n\nIt's expected to continue moving north through the Gulf of Mexico Friday and\nSaturday and approach Louisiana's coast Sunday.\n\nStrengthening expected?\n\nCristobal weakened Thursday and became less organized overnight, forecasters\nsaid Friday morning.\n\nThe storm is expected to stay over land for another 12 to 18 hours,\nforecasters said at 4 a.m. Friday, and no change in strength is expected\nduring that time.\n\nCristobal is forecast to strengthen once it moves over the Gulf of Mexico and\nregain its tropical storm status, meaning wind speeds will exceed 39 mph.\n\nForecasters said conditions in the Gulf -- specifically, expected moderate\nsouthwesterly wind shear and dry mid-level air -- are not expected to be \"very\nconducive\" for intensification for this storm. However, they said there is\nsome uncertainty about Cristobal's forecasted strength when it reaches the\nGulf Coast.\n\nMaximum sustained winds of 60 mph are expected at landfall, forecasters said,\nwhich would make it a tropical storm. A Category 1 hurricane has winds of at\n74 mph.\n\nWatches and warnings?\n\nA flood watch is in effect for much of Southeast Louisiana, including New\nOrleans and Baton Rouge, through 7 a.m. Tuesday. Read the full advisory.\n\nA tropical storm watch is in effect for some of Louisiana's coastal waters.\n\nTropical storm conditions will likely start Saturday afternoon in the watch\narea with winds in excess of 40 knots, the National Weather Service in Slidell\nsaid.\n\nThe watch is for outer coastal waters south and west of the mouth of the\nMississippi River.\n\nWhat should Louisiana expect?\n\nThe center of the storm is expected to make landfall along the central\nLouisiana coast, but the strongest winds, highest storm surge and heaviest\nrains could be \"well removed\" from the center, forecasters said.\n\nThere is a risk of tropical-storm-force winds this weekend from Louisiana to\nthe western Florida panhandle, forecasters said. There's also a risk of\ndangerous storm surge from Louisiana to the Florida Big Bend.\n\nThese hazards, along with heavy rainfall, will arrive \"well in advance\" of\nCristobal and extend well east of the center.\n\nTropical funnels and tornadoes are also possible as the storm approaches, the\nNational Weather Service in Slidell said Friday morning.\n\nTropical storm and storm surge watches will likely be issued Friday for a\nportion of the Gulf Coast, forecasters said.\n\nCoastal flooding also is possible.\n\nWet weather, with occasional heavy rainfall, is expected through the rest of\nthe week into early next week, the National Weather Service said. \"Copious\nrainfall\" is possible each day, with rainfall rates at times of 2 to 4 inches\nper hour.\n\nRainfall totals over the seven-day period \"could easily exceed 10 inches\"\nwithin the watch area in southeast Louisiana, the National Weather Service\nsaid.\n\nThe heavy rainfall could lead to street flooding and rapid rises of creeks and\nstreams.\n\n\"Drainage systems may approach capacity at times during periods of heaviest\nrainfall,\" the National Weather Service cautioned.\n\nWhen will it get to Louisiana?\n\nTropical-storm-force winds from Cristobal could reach New Orleans and\nsoutheast Louisiana as early as Saturday night, National Weather Service\nforecasters said.\n\nHowever, the wind will most likely begin mid-day Sunday, they said, and could\nlast through Monday.\n\nFor the central coast of Louisiana, forecasters with the Lake Charles office\nof the National Weather Service said a few rain bands from Cristobal could\nreach the area as early as Saturday afternoon, with rain increasing and\nbecoming more widespread Sunday into Monday.\n\nEmergency declaration for Louisiana\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards issued an emergency declaration Thursday night that\nallows state agencies to take emergency actions involving the storm and sets\nthe stage for future federal financial relief, if necessary.\n\n\"While it is still too early to know for sure what impact Cristobal could have\non Louisiana, now is the time to make your plans, which should include the\ntraditional emergency items along with masks and hand sanitizer as we continue\nto battle the coronavirus pandemic,\" Edwards said.\n\nWhile no evacuations were being considered as of Wednesday, Edwards said the\nGovernor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness is working\nto see if evacuees can use hotels and motels, instead of traditional large-\nspace shelters, if an evacuation is required. If shelters are used, the state\nhas plans for social distancing inside.\n\nWhen is the next update?\n\nThe next advisory is expected at 10 a.m. from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nRead the full 4 a.m. advisory.\n\nSee our full coverage of Tropical Depression Cristobal.\n\nReporters Mark Schleifstein and Sam Karlin contributed to this story.",

It had sustained winds of 35 mph.</p>\n\n<p>It has completed a slow loop and is heading northeast at 7 mph, forecasters said.</p>\n\n<p>It's expected to continue moving north through the Gulf of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</location> Friday and Saturday and approach <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana's</location> coast Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>Strengthening expected?</p>\n\n<p>Cristobal weakened Thursday and became less organized overnight, forecasters said Friday morning.</p>\n\n<p>The storm is expected to stay over land for another 12 to 18 hours, forecasters said at <chron>4 a.m. Friday</chron>, and no change in strength is expected during that time.</p>\n\n<p>Cristobal is forecast to strengthen once it moves over the <location>Gulf of Mexico</location> and regain its tropical storm status, meaning wind speeds will exceed 39 mph.</p>\n\n<p>Forecasters said conditions in the Gulf -- specifically, expected moderate southwesterly wind shear and dry mid-level air -- are not expected to be \"very conducive\" for intensification for this storm. However, they said there is some uncertainty about Cristobal's forecasted strength when it reaches the <location>Gulf Coast</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Maximum sustained winds of 60 mph are expected at landfall, forecasters said, which would make it a tropical storm. A Category 1 hurricane has winds of at 74 mph.</p>\n\n<p>Watches and warnings?</p>\n\n<p>A flood watch is in effect for much of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Southeast Louisiana</location>, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.batrge\">Baton Rouge</location>, through <chron>7 a.m. Tuesday</chron>.

There's also a risk of dangerous storm surge from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location> to the Florida Big Bend.</p>\n\n<p>These hazards, along with heavy rainfall, will arrive \"well in advance\" of Cristobal and extend well east of the center.</p>\n\n<p>Tropical funnels and tornadoes are also possible as the storm approaches, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4283943344\">National Weather Service</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.sliell\">Slidell</location> said Friday morning.</p>\n\n<p>Tropical storm and storm surge watches will likely be issued Friday for a portion of the <location>Gulf Coast</location>, forecasters said.</p>\n\n<p>Coastal flooding also is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Wet weather, with occasional heavy rainfall, is expected through the rest of the week into early next week, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4283943344\">National Weather Service</org> said. \"Copious rainfall\" is possible each day, with rainfall rates at times of 2 to 4 inches per hour.</p>\n\n<p>Rainfall totals over the seven-day period \"could easily exceed 10 inches\" within the watch area in southeast <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location>, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4283943344\">National Weather Service</org> said.</p>\n\n<p>The heavy rainfall could lead to street flooding and rapid rises of creeks and streams.</p>\n\n<p>\"Drainage systems may approach capacity at times during periods of heaviest rainfall,\" the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4283943344\">National Weather Service</org> cautioned.</p>\n\n<p>When will it get to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location>?</p>\n\n<p>Tropical-storm-force winds from Cristobal could reach <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.nworln\">New Orleans</location> and southeast <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location> as early as Saturday night, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4283943344\">National Weather Service</org> forecasters said.</p>\n\n<p>However, the wind will most likely begin mid-day Sunday, they said, and could last through Monday.</p>\n\n<p>For the central coast of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location>, forecasters with the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.la.lakles\">Lake Charles</location> office of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4283943344\">National Weather Service</org> said a few rain bands from Cristobal could reach the area as early as Saturday afternoon, with rain increasing and becoming more widespread Sunday into Monday.</p>\n\n<p>Emergency declaration for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location></p>\n\n<p>Gov. <person>John Bel Edwards</person> issued an emergency declaration Thursday night that allows state agencies to take emergency actions involving the storm and sets the stage for future federal financial relief, if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>\"While it is still too early to know for sure what impact Cristobal could have on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.la\">Louisiana</location>, now is the time to make your plans, which should include the traditional emergency items along with masks and hand sanitizer as we continue to battle the coronavirus pandemic,\" Edwards said.</p>\n\n<p>While no evacuations were being considered as of Wednesday, Edwards said the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3054607986\">Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness</org> is working to see if evacuees can use hotels and motels, instead of traditional large-space shelters, if an evacuation is required.
