    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology\nBusiness Daily \\-- A patent application by the inventors Lin, Jhao-Yi (Taipei\nCity, Taiwan); Chen, Chih-Sheng (Taipei City, Taiwan); Hsu, Ching-Wen (Taipei\nCity, Taiwan), filed on April 17, 2019, was made available online on May 21,\n2020, according to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx\ncorrespondents.\n\nThis patent application is assigned to RichWave Technology Corp. (Taipei City,\nTaiwan).\n\nThe following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background\ninformation supplied by the inventors: \"In the communication module of the\nmobile electronic device, the transmission and reception of RF signals are\nusually performed with the same antenna. For example, the transmitter and the\nreceiver in the communication module can be coupled to the same antenna. When\nthe communication module needs to receive the RF signal through the antenna,\nthe communication module would activate the low noise amplifier (LNA) in the\nreceiver to amplify the RF signals to obtain the information. Also, when the\ncommunication module needs to transmit the RF signals through the antenna, the\ncommunication module would activate the power amplifier (PA) in the\ntransmitter to amplify the RF signals and output the RF signals through the\nantenna.\n\n\"Generally, the low noise amplifier at the receiver may be rather vulnerable\nto withstand high power signals. Therefore, when the communication module\nreceives the RF signals through the antenna, if the system activates the\ntransmitter or couples the energy of the transmitter internally, the RF\nsignals generated by the transmitter will be inputted to the low noise\namplifier, causing the low noise amplifier to not function properly and even\ndamage the low noise amplifier.\n\n\"In prior art, in order to protect the low noise amplifier, a clamp circuit is\nusually added at the input terminal of the low noise amplifier to prevent the\nover swinging RF signal generated by the transmitter from entering the low\nnoise amplifier and causing damage. However, the matching impedance inside the\nreceiver is also changed, making the receiver fail to achieve the expected\nperformance in the linearity of signal amplification.\"\n\nIn addition to the background information obtained for this patent\napplication, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary\ninformation for this patent application: \"One embodiment of the present\ninvention discloses an amplification device.

For example, the transmitter and the receiver in the communication module can be coupled to the same antenna. When the communication module needs to receive the RF signal through the antenna, the communication module would activate the low noise amplifier (LNA) in the receiver to amplify the RF signals to obtain the information. Also, when the communication module needs to transmit the RF signals through the antenna, the communication module would activate the power amplifier (PA) in the transmitter to amplify the RF signals and output the RF signals through the antenna.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Generally, the low noise amplifier at the receiver may be rather vulnerable to withstand high power signals. Therefore, when the communication module receives the RF signals through the antenna, if the system activates the transmitter or couples the energy of the transmitter internally, the RF signals generated by the transmitter will be inputted to the low noise amplifier, causing the low noise amplifier to not function properly and even damage the low noise amplifier.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In prior art, in order to protect the low noise amplifier, a clamp circuit is usually added at the input terminal of the low noise amplifier to prevent the over swinging RF signal generated by the transmitter from entering the low noise amplifier and causing damage. However, the matching impedance inside the receiver is also changed, making the receiver fail to achieve the expected performance in the linearity of signal amplification.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;One embodiment of the present invention discloses an amplification device.
