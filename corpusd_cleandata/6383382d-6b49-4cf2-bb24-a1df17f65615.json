Ages 2 to\n14 participated in the contest which started midnight June 6 and ended at\n11:30 p.m. June 7.\n\nSixty people posted a picture of their child and their \"catch of the day\" on\nthe Le Sueur County Sheriff's Office Facebook event page. Each participant was\nput into a drawing for a chance to win a cooler full of fishing gear including\na rod, reel, tackle and a Minnesota Vikings football.\n\n\"The normal contest usually attracts 60 to 70 kids, so we had a pretty\npositive showing,\" Le Sueur County Deputy Sheriff Nick Greenig said. \"The\nVikings normally fish with the kids but couldn't this year because of the\npandemic.\" The three raffle winners are: Isabella Schultz, Kyler Link and\nMaverick Michels.\n\nThe entries included eight different species of fish caught on 15 different\nlakes. The catches included 29 sunfish, 14 large mouth bass, five northerns,\nfour crappies, two walleyes, one perch and one white bass.\n\nThe most fish (20) came from the East-West-Middle Jefferson chain of lakes.\nNext most frequent fish were 13 caught at German Lake. Lake Washington had\nfour fish caught, Tetonka had three, Emily, Lake Sakatah and Sabre two each,\nMadison, Gorman, Volney and Lexington one each.\n\nPlans for next year have not been finalized, but Greenig said, \"We're hoping\nto go back to normal and take kids out in boats.\"",

Ages 2 to 14 participated in the contest which started midnight <chron>June 6</chron> and ended at <chron>11:30 p.m.</chron> <chron>June 7</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty people posted a picture of their child and their \"catch of the day\" on the Le Sueur County Sheriff's Office Facebook event page. Each participant was put into a drawing for a chance to win a cooler full of fishing gear including a rod, reel, tackle and a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131542\">Minnesota Vikings</org> football.</p>\n\n<p>\"The normal contest usually attracts 60 to 70 kids, so we had a pretty positive showing,\" Le Sueur County Deputy Sheriff <person>Nick Greenig</person> said. \"The Vikings normally fish with the kids but couldn't this year because of the pandemic.\" The three raffle winners are: <person>Isabella Schultz</person>, <person>Kyler Link</person> and <person>Maverick Michels</person>.</p>\n\n<p>The entries included eight different species of fish caught on 15 different lakes. The catches included 29 sunfish, 14 large mouth bass, five northerns, four crappies, two walleyes, one perch and one white bass.</p>\n\n<p>The most fish (20) came from the East-West-Middle Jefferson chain of lakes. Next most frequent fish were 13 caught at <location>German Lake</location>. <location>Lake Washington</location> had four fish caught, Tetonka had three, Emily, <location>Lake Sakatah</location> and Sabre two each, Madison, Gorman, Volney and Lexington one each.</p>\n\n<p>Plans for next year have not been finalized, but Greenig said, \"We're hoping to go back to normal and take kids out in boats.\"</p>",
