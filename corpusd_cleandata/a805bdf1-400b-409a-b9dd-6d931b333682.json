    "text": "I started my career as a public safety dispatcher just two years after the\nRodney King riots left a gaping wound on all of America, in the same county\nthat acquitted the four officers, determined to be part of the solution. Am I\nangry that 26 years into my career, this type of treatment of my fellow human\nbeings is still going on? Hell, yes. I understand that anger.\n\nBut I am now, all these years later, more disappointed and heartbroken that we\nare still having this conversation (if you ever got the \"I'm disappointed in\nyou\" speech from a parent, you'll know that phrase, a lot of times, was worse\nthan getting yelled at). I'm disappointed that we, as a nation and as law\nenforcement, have not done better. I'm disappointed that \"we\" in law\nenforcement have not weeded out those individuals who still see colors when\nthey enforce the law. I'm disappointed that we are still having people of\ncolor unjustly dying at the hands of these evil people when the vast majority\nof us just want to make our corner of the world a little better place.\n\nI am heartbroken for the family of George Floyd and any other family that has\nhad to go through this. I am heartbroken that officers are being injured\nbecause of the actions of others like them who should have done better. I'm\nheartbroken that 26 years later, nothing has changed.\n\nI'm very close retirement and while I may have made a difference in my little\npond, the seas are rising up and threatening to drown us all because we have\nfailed. And I'm heartbroken and disappointed in that failure.\n\nStep up and be the voices for change from within our law enforcement\norganizations. Lead by example. Be part of the solution.\n\nMarlana Biesecker, Ventura",

Am I angry that 26 years into my career, this type of treatment of my fellow human beings is still going on? Hell, yes. I understand that anger.</p>\n<p>But I am now, all these years later, more disappointed and heartbroken that we are still having this conversation (if you ever got the \"I'm disappointed in you\" speech from a parent, you'll know that phrase, a lot of times, was worse than getting yelled at). I'm disappointed that we, as a nation and as law enforcement, have not done better. I'm disappointed that \"we\" in law enforcement have not weeded out those individuals who still see colors when they enforce the law. I'm disappointed that we are still having people of color unjustly dying at the hands of these evil people when the vast majority of us just want to make our corner of the world a little better place.</p>\n\n<p>I am heartbroken for the family of <person>George Floyd</person> and any other family that has had to go through this. I am heartbroken that officers are being injured because of the actions of others like them who should have done better. I'm heartbroken that 26 years later, nothing has changed.</p>\n\n<p>I'm very close retirement and while I may have made a difference in my little pond, the seas are rising up and threatening to drown us all because we have failed. And I'm heartbroken and disappointed in that failure.</p>\n\n<p>Step up and be the voices for change from within our law enforcement organizations. Lead by example. Be part of the solution.</p>\n\n<p><person>Marlana Biesecker</person>, Ventura</p>",
