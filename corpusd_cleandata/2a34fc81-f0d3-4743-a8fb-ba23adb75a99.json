    "text": "The team at IFLR is delighted to announce the winning deals, teams and law\nfirms for the 2020 Europe awards and to offer our congratulations.\n\nThis announcement caps off months of research by the team, accompanied by\nplenty of discussion along the way between the IFLR journalists and editors\nwho make up the internal judging panel.\n\nThe Europe awards recognise legal innovation in cross-border transactions\nacross Europe. To be considered, all deals must meet specific criteria that\nmake them both cross-border and European. They must also have completed in\n2019 - we do not include announced or signed deals.\n\nGiven the difficult global environment, we are unable to host a ceremony to\ncelebrate the work highlighted below. However, we believe it is as important\nas ever to recognise the achievements, the legal ingenuity and potential for\ninnovation that the market will depend on going forward.\n\n**Please also listen to our first ever awards podcast, where we discuss\nresearch highlights and some of the themes that emerged during the process.**\n\n **Please note:** we will be releasing a series of podcasts covering the IFLR\nawards for Asia-Pacific and Americas and look out for other awards-related\npodcast interviews in the pipeline. To find out about taking part in a podcast\nto explore any of your work that appears in the awards please contact:\n[liam.sharkey@iflr.com](mailto:liam.sharkey@iflr.com)\n\nCongratulations to all the winners.\n\n  \n  \n\n**DEALS OF THE YEAR**\n\n **Debt and equity-linked**\n\n **Associated British Ports Libor-to-Sonia bond switch**\n\nThe UK's biggest port operator ABP was the first sterling borrower to issue\nnew floating rate bonds tied to the Sonia [sterling overnight index average]\nrate. It was also the first company to amend legacy debt to replace Libor with\nSonia, setting a benchmark for the market. This transaction is the seminal\ndeal for migrating legacy bonds into Sonia and established an approach on\nissues such as the application of a spread adjustment and the treatment of\nconsent solicitation fees. The latter were waived, which presented a key\nprecedent. The consent solicitation was tightly timed to avoid having to\ncreate an alternative pricing methodology or an adjustment to the interpolated\nbasis. ABP made the documentation freely available.\n\n**Law firms**\n\nClifford Chance \\- NatWest Markets and Deutsche Trustee Company  \nLinklaters \\- ABP\n\n **Equity**\n\n **Huatai Securities IPO**\n\nHuatai Securities is the first Chinese company to offer global depository\nreceipts (GDRs) representing its shares in London and the first to be\nconducted under the new Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme, which directly\nlinks the Chinese and European capital markets by providing a two-way\nfungibility mechanism between securities listed in London and Shanghai. The\nStock Connect scheme represents the culmination of three years of work by the\nrelevant stock exchanges and regulators. It resulted in the creation of a new\nsegment of the LSE's main market, with Huatai Securities as its first\nadmission. The listing had to contend with a continually evolving regulatory\narchitecture and interpret and define the scope of the new rules in place.\n\n **Law firms**\n\nBaker McKenzie \\- Depositary  \nClifford Chance \\- Huatai Securities  \nFangda Partners \\- Huatai Securities  \nKing & Wood Mallesons - JP Morgan, Huatai Securities, Morgan Stanley (joint\nglobal coordinators and joint bookrunners) and Credit Suisse and HSBC (joint\nbookrunners)  \nLinklaters \\- JP Morgan, Huatai Securities, Morgan Stanley (joint global\ncoordinators and joint bookrunners) and Credit Suisse and HSBC (joint\nbookrunners)\n\n **High yield**\n\n **Kantar**\n\nThe $3 billion financing commitment for Bain Capital's acquisition of Kantar\nincluded nearly \u20ac1.5 billion of senior secured and senior notes. It was a vast\ndeal, with a long list of unique challenges deriving from it being a carveout\nfrom a public company that was operating businesses in 30 countries and\nmanaging employees in over 100. One standout innovation was the structuring of\na 'dual' single enforcement point to cater for WPP's rollover stake. This\nresulted in separate silos for the US and the rest-of-world portions of the\nbusiness, including Luxembourg partnerships, Luxembourg companies and US\ncompanies as issuers, holding vehicles and providers of third-party security\nand bespoke rules for cash management between the silos.\n\n **Law firms**\n\nAllen & Overy - WPP  \nArendt & Medernach - Bain Capital  \nAshurst (Australia) - Mandated lead arrangers  \nGilbert + Tobin - Bain Capital  \nLoyens & Loeff Luxembourg - Mandated lead arrangers  \nPaul Hastings \\- Mandated lead arrangers (including Goldman Sachs, Morgan\nStanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch)  \nWeil Gotshal & Manges - Bain Capital  \nWhite & Case - Trustee\n\n **Loan**\n\n **KIRKBY, Blackstone and CPPIB / Merlin Entertainments acquisition financing\n**\n\nThe bank debt for the acquisition of Merlin comprised euro and dollar term\nloan tranches, a dollar delayed draw tranche and a sterling RCF [revolving\ncredit facility] tranche, with a cross-border syndication process in Europe\nand the US. Merlin had two sets of existing bonds, so the lending had to cater\nfor the change of control waiver process over the existing dollar bonds and\nthe introduction of new notes, which at that point were unsecured. This\nrequired an innovative evergreen intercreditor agreement to achieve equal and\nrateable security with the bank debt. The delayed draw mechanism is a new\naddition to the European markets. The documentation also had to accommodate\nMerlin's entire global business.\n\n **Law firms**\n\nClifford Chance \\- KIRKBY Group  \nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer \\- Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB)  \nKirkland & Ellis - Blackstone  \nLatham & Watkins \\- Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Barclays\nBank, HSBC, Mizuho Bank and UniCredit Bank\n\n **M &A**\n\n **Gilead Sciences \\- Galapagos**\n\nThis is a global first for pharma-biotech: an arm's-length acquisition of a\nbusiness and its future business agreed between two listed entities (US and\nBelgium). It involves Gilead taking an equity stake in Galapagos with the\noption for a future acquisition in the share structure in the form of two\nwarrants. The structure allows Galapagos to continue developing drugs\nindependently, while giving Gilead an option agreement on any discovery that\nGalapagos makes. This highly unusual structure required complex corporate,\ngovernance, competition, healthcare, licensing and IP structuring. It had to\nbe flexible enough to accommodate Galapagos' future development and pipeline\nfor any and all products, while providing a framework for how to sell and\nmarket future projects globally.\n\n**Law firms**\n\nBaker McKenzie \\- Galapagos  \nCovington & Burling - Gilead Sciences  \nEubelius - Gilead Sciences  \nLinklaters \\- Galapagos  \nSkadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom \\- Gilead Sciences\n\n **Private equity**\n\n **Inmarsat take-private **\n\nInmarsat represents a complex public target acquired in a challenging\nenvironment. Its key assets are satellites (the deal required space law\nexpertise) and it has contracts with governments and private entities\nworldwide. Satellites and telecoms are a highly sensitive business area for\nforeign investment and attract heavy government scrutiny. Inmarsat's\nsubstantial US business required specialist Cfius [Committee on Foreign\nInvestment in the US] and Federal Communications Commission advice. As a\npublic-to-private of a UK-listed company, the PE consortium bidders' US\nfinancing needed to be UK Takeover Code-compliant. It is one of only three\ndeals to have published detailed post-offer undertakings to the UK government.\nThe deal also sets a precedent in overcoming a first-of-its-kind court\nchallenge to the scheme by hedge funds.\n\n**Law firms**\n\nAlden - Triton Bidco  \nBaker McKenzie \\- UBS  \nClifford Chance \\- Inmarsat  \nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer \\- Triton Bidco  \nGilbert + Tobin - Triton Bidco  \nKirkland & Ellis - Triton Bidco (Apax, Warburg Pincus, Canada Pension Plan\nInvestment Board and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan)  \nMishcon de Reya \\- Triton Bidco  \nWeil Gotshal & Manges - Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP)  \nWiley Rein \\- Triton Bidco\n\n **Project finance**\n\n **IFC / City of Belgrade waste management PPP **\n\nThis is the first project of its kind in Serbia, which is significant in the\ncontext of Serbia's EU accession plans. It comprises \u20ac300 million of\nnonrecourse project financing to Beo \u010cista Energija, an SPV [special purpose\nvehicle] formed by Suez Groupe, Itochu and Marguerite Waste Serbia that has a\n25-year public private partnership (PPP) agreement with the City of Belgrade\nfor the Vin\u010da landfill. The project includes a waste-to-energy power plant\nconnected to the national grid and a recycling facility, replacing the\nexisting landfill with an engineered landfill with biogas recovery. It is one\nof the most significant waste-to-energy projects in Europe, establishing a\nuseful template for other pathfinder projects.\n\n**Law firms**\n\nBDK Advokati - Lenders  \nBaker McKenzie \\- Suez-Itochu consortium (Beo Cista Energija)  \nClifford Chance \\- International Finance Corporation (IFC), the European Bank\nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the  \nDevelopment Bank of Austria (OeEB) (lenders)  \nHogan Lovells - IFC and the City of Belgrade  \nKaranovic & Partners \\- IFC and the City of Belgrade  \nWolf Theiss - Beo Cista Energija\n\n **Restructuring**\n\n **Agrokor**\n\nAgrokor's restructuring was completely unprecedented, huge in scale - there\nwere 8,000 people at the creditors meeting - and highly political. Agrokor\naccounted for 15% of Croatia's GDP and owned over 140 companies. Croatia's\ngovernment passed an emergency law to address the case and Agrokor was\nrestructured under this new framework, subsequently known as Lex Agrokor. The\nlaw is the first of its kind in Croatia, offering the market an interesting\nprecedent. Among the many novel aspects, the new money terms involved a 'roll\nup' of new money providers' existing claims, the law enabled the payment of\npre-petition claims to critical suppliers, and there were innovative\ntechnicalities to the equitisation of \u20ac7 billion of debt.\n\n**Law firms**\n\nAkin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld \\- Creditor committee  \nBogdanovi\u0107 Doli\u010dki & Partners - Agrokor  \nGGP Law Firm - Agrokor  \nHarrisons - Agrokor  \nHogan Lovells - Ad hoc bondholder committee  \nHouthoff - Creditor committee  \nKirkland & Ellis - Agrokor  \nLinklaters \\- Sberbank  \nMadirazza & Partneri - Creditor committee  \nMaric & Co - Agrokor  \nNautaDutilh - Agrokor  \nReed Smith \\- Bank of New York Mellon  \nRojs Peljhan Prelesnik & Partners \\- Agrokor  \nShearman & Sterling - Syndicated and club bank lenders  \nVeselinovic & Co - Agrokor  \nWillkie Farr & Gallagher \\- Senior creditor\n\n **Structured finance & securitisation**\n\n **Stenn trade receivables securitisation**\n\nThis is the establishment and refinancing of a trade receivables\nsecuritisation platform. The platform is backed by receivables acquired by\nStenn from suppliers and other factoring companies in over 50 jurisdictions.\nIt required analysis of receivables contracts and on-sale agreements in 16\njurisdictions, doubly complicated in refinancing due to intermediary\ninvolvement before the receivables are sold to Stenn. The deal included pre-\nfunding mechanics to boost Stenn's liquidity and accommodated daily sales and\nweekly and monthly waterfalls. It holds together multiple funding instruments\n(from senior notes to four classes of mezzanine term notes) through complex\nintercreditor and borrowing base mechanics. Certain cashflows within the SPV\nare reserved for particular investors. The structure is also credit insurance\nwrapped.\n\n**Law firms**\n\nArthur Cox \\- Issuer (Stenn Assets Funding Designated Activity Company)  \nClifford Chance \\- Natixis, NN Investment Partners and M&G Investments; TMF\n(security trustee and cash manager)  \nDentons - Originator (Stenn Assets UK)  \nLatham & Watkins \\- Originator (Stenn Assets UK)  \nNorton Rose Fulbright \\- Credit insurer (AIG)  \nPinsent Masons \\- Issuer account bank (Barclays)  \nWalkers - Performance guarantor (Stenn Holdings)  \n\n **RISING STARS OF THE YEAR**\n\n **International**\n\n **Nick Charlwood \\- Allen & Overy**\n\nNick Charlwood was admitted in 2011 and is part of Allen & Overy's impressive\nrestructuring practice. He had a key role in the team that advised the formal\ncoordinating creditors committee in the restructuring of shortlisted Steinhoff\nGroup, where, according to a client, \"he didn't bat an eyelid\". In another\nIFLR award-winning project, he helped advise the creditors' committee on the\nrestructuring of Drydocks World. His experience in China and Hong Kong SAR,\nalong with a recent secondment to Deutsche Bank, make him one to watch.\nClients say he is \"consistently very good\".\n\n**James Heller \\- Baker McKenzie **\n\nJames Heller qualified in 2013 and is part of Baker McKenzie's M&A practice.\nIn 2019 he had an involved role as lead associate on Hitachi's $11 billion\nacquisition and carveout of ABB's power grids business. He was also lead\nassociate for the team representing the selling shareholders on the $3 billion\nsale to Blackstone of dating app business MagicLab. A third notable role saw\nhim again acting as lead associate for Fiera Infrastructure on its acquisition\nof 50% of Wightlink.\n\n**Patrick Kwak \\- Latham & Watkins**\n\nPatrick Kwak is a New York-qualified high yield bond lawyer who obtained his\nJD in 2014 from Osgoode Hall Law School. He is recognised as one of the rising\nstars in Latham's award-winning London high yield practice. He garnered plenty\nof great feedback through our awards research and was part of the team that\nadvised the syndicate of banks on the Nexi's 2018 high yield bond offering,\nwhich won IFLR's 2019 high yield deal of the year. He also had roles on the\nfinancing of EQT and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority's acquisition of Nestle's\nSkin Health.\n\n**National**\n\n **Christina Del Vecchio \\- Niederer Kraft Frey**\n\nChristina Del Vecchio qualified in 2008 and is a recently appointed counsel in\nNiederer Kraft Frey, with a great deal track record. In 2019 she was\ninstrumental in the IPOs by Stadler Rail and Medacta Group, both on the SIX\nSwiss Exchange, both of which required an array of complex legal work. Before\nthat she had important roles on other landmark deals including the IPO of SIG\nCombi Block in 2018 and Johnson & Johnson's takeover of Actelion in 2017.\n\n **Zeno Grabmayr - Wolf Theiss**\n\nZeno Grabmayr has been with Wolf Theiss Austria since 2012. Among other recent\nhighlights, he took the operational lead on the acquisition and restructuring\nof Hypo Alpe Adria's SEE banking and leasing business and subsequent IPO on\nthe Vienna Stock Exchange. The matter required extensive cross-border work\nspanning Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and\nSlovenia. He also had a lead role advising Miba on its acquisition of a stake\nin the Austrian battery specialist Voltlabor and DDM Group on the purchase of\na portfolio of distressed assets in Croatia from Heta Asset Resolution.\n\n **Joel Fischer \\- Bar & Karrer**\n\nJoel Fischer qualified in 2009 and has been a key associate in Bar & Karrer's\nfinancial regulation and finreg contentious practice since 2015. He has an\nimpressive portfolio of very novel work, albeit almost entirely confidential.\nHe has been responsible for managing large cross-border cases involving all\nmanner of financial regulatory issues, internal processes and investigation\nmanagement. In one long-running case he had oversight of a 25-lawyer team, and\nhe has extensive experience working with regulators in several jurisdictions\nand has an exemplary track record.  \n\n **TEAMS OF THE YEAR**\n\n **Debt and equity-linked**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nClifford Chance takes this year's debt and equity-linked team award. It\nreflects the firm's role on ABP's winning Libor-to-Sonia bond switch, where\nits lawyers worked with ABP, the banks and other counsel to create a set of\ndocuments and conventions that established a benchmark for the market. The\nteam played a key role in delivering RBS's social bond, a first out of the UK.\nIt also sponsored a wide range of innovative structures across Europe,\nincluding UniCredit Leasing's eurobond, which was a first for Romania and\nresolved complex English, Italian and Romanian law issues, and finally DNB\nBank's AT1, a very successful Norwegian regulatory capital offering.\n\n **Equity**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nThe Clifford Chance equity team wins the award this year with a display of\nversatility across a broad range of transactions. The team provided English\nand Hong Kong law advice on the winning Huatai Securities' IPO, which entailed\na vast amount of novel legal work under an entirely new listing framework. The\nfirm also advised the banks on the DWF IPO, the first true listing of an\ninternational law firm. In a third shortlisted deal, Clifford Chance worked on\nthe German and US law aspects of the blockbuster Traton IPO, which required\nmyriad novel underwriter considerations.\n\n **High yield**\n\n **Latham & Watkins**\n\nLatham is no stranger to the high yield award and despite tough competition it\nretains the top prize. The team is on all but two shortlisted deals, which\ndemonstrates how in demand it is and its capacity for one-off deals. The\nhighlights were its work on the acquisition financing packages for Merlin\nEntertainments and Saszka Group, and the transformational Pinewood Studios\noffering. The innovation in these deals touches many markets and legal\nconsiderations. As well as depth, they required a broad pool of specialist\nexpertise, whether in real estate or in structuring under the UK Takeover\nCode, US SEC rules or the Greek public tender regime.\n\n**Loans**\n\n **Latham & Watkins**\n\nLatham & Watkins pipped other firms to the post to win the loans team award.\nAmong the highlights, Latham's lawyers advised the bank consortium on English,\nDanish, Italian, US and Luxembourg law in the financing package for the\nacquisition of Merlin Entertainments: a deal fully syndicated in the US and\nEurope that required innovative intercreditor arrangements and a delayed draw\nstructure. Latham also advised the banks on a complicated financing for\nBidFair MergeRight's acquisition of Sotheby's. Its transatlantic expertise\npaid dividends in 2019 and the team proved its mettle.\n\n**M &A**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nClifford Chance has had a great year for M&A in Europe. The firm worked on\nhalf of the shortlisted deals, with heavy involvement across its offices in\nthe region. Out of Germany, the M&A team advised Volkswagen on the potentially\ntransformative (for the industry) Gigafactory-Northvolt JV and helped Merck\nstructure an immensely complex and bespoke collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline.\nThe Dutch team guided Caceis through an innovative public offer for Kas Bank,\nwhich threaded its way through the DBN and ECB. A team also advised Emirates\nNBD on its acquisition of Turkey's Denizbank. Very few firms would have this\nsort of capacity.\n\n**Private equity**\n\n **Kirkland & Ellis**\n\nThe Kirkland & Ellis private equity team once again stood out. The firm had an\nimpressive line-up of lawyers advising a consortium of four global private\nequity firms, each with an equal voice at the table, on the public-to-private\nmove of Inmarsat, this year's winning deal. The lawyers covered new ground in\nmany respects, setting down a vital benchmark for UK foreign investments. The\nteam also put EQT in the best position to prevail in a highly competitive\nauction to buy Galderma Skin Health and advised Blackstone as consortium lead\nin the acquisition of Merlin Entertainments; both high-impact deals.\n\n**Project finance**\n\n **Hogan Lovells**\n\nThere were very fine margins in the project finance category, but Hogan\nLovells inched ahead thanks in part to its work on the winning Belgrade City\nwaste-to-energy project. The firm advised the lending banks and the City of\nBelgrade on the financing package for a first-of-its-kind PPP. As a pathfinder\nproject there were a multitude of new legal considerations. Lawyers also\nrepresented the 15 lending institutions financing the UK's Silvertown Tunnel\nPPP. The lenders were spread across the globe and collaborated in a complex\nfinancing package. The team also advised the lenders on Brookfield's\nrefinancing of a portfolio of 18 onshore windfarms.\n\n**Restructuring**\n\n **Kirkland & Ellis**\n\nKirkland & Ellis follows last year's restructuring team of the year win with\nanother. The firm played a key role in piecing together the first-of-its-kind\nrestructuring of Agrokor, which wins deal of the year. The firm was also\nglobal lead for Galapagos, advising on English, German and New York law.\nAnother team mapped out and documented the Lebara restructuring on behalf of\nthe bondholders. The firm also represented the ad hoc convertible bondholder\ncommittee in the Steinhoff restructuring, again providing English, German and\nNew York law support. This shows impressive breadth and deep capacity to find\na way through challenging situations.\n\n**Structured finance and securitisation**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nClifford Chance retains the structured finance and securitisation award. The\nteam worked on five of the shortlisted deals, including the winning Stenn\ntrade receivables securitisation. Other shortlisted deals where the firm\nplayed a critical role include two RMBS transactions in England (Syon\nSecurities) and Ireland (Mulcair Securities) and two NPL securitisations in\nSpain (Prosil Acquisition) and Greece (Eurobank Ergasias). Away from the\nshortlist, the team created bespoke transactions for LendInvest and Banco\nSantander Totta and advised on a novel electricity tariff deficit\nsecuritisation in Portugal. It was a dominant all-round performance.\n\n**Financial services regulatory**\n\n **Allen & Overy**\n\nAllen & Overy impressed throughout 2019. The practice has been in high demand\nand in response has grown from three to eight partners since 2016. Two new\npartners joined in 2019, including New York-qualified Knox McIlwain. The team\nis supported by an extensive network of lawyers. In 2019 Kate Sumpter won best\nin financial regulation at our European Women in Business Law awards. In 2019\nthe firm also launched a new global financial services regulatory group.\nBrexit has been a key area of focus both in terms of regulatory and compliance\n- where 14 banks purchased a specialised legal toolkit - and transactions.  \n\n**LAW FIRMS OF THE YEAR**\n\n **US law firm of the year**\n\n **Kirkland & Ellis**\n\nWith team wins for its private equity and restructuring practices, Kirkland &\nEllis proved its capacity for innovation across a range of complex and high-\nimpact multijurisdictional deals in Europe. While it would be hard to overlook\nthe firm in these two practices, it also stood out in high yield and had key\nroles in shortlisted equity capital markets transactions. The transatlantic\nexpertise, as well as depth in practice areas such as healthcare, stood out.\nThe firm was critical in piecing together some of the most challenging and\ngroundbreaking deals of the year, including Merlin Entertainments, Inmarsat,\nAgrokor, Steinhoff, Galderma Skin Health, Lebara.\n\n**International law firm of the year**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nClifford Chance demonstrates depth, breadth and geographical clout across the\naward categories. The firm picked up four impressive team awards, with\nespecially strong performances across the debt and equity capital markets and\nin structured finance and securitisation, M&A, private equity, and project\nfinance. Its lawyers also had key roles in structuring four of this year's\nwinning transactions. Offices across Europe, including the UK, Germany, Spain\nand Benelux took lead roles on some of the most innovative deals covered in\nthe research. The financial services regulatory practice also stands out and\ncontinues to take a lead in developing areas.  \n\n**IN-HOUSE TEAMS OF THE YEAR**\n\n **In-house debt**\n\n **NatWest Markets**\n\nThe in-house debt capital markets lawyers at NatWest Markets had their work\ncut out for them last year with the bank's hefty roles as solicitation agent\non the winning Associated British Ports Libor-to-Sonia bond switch; as\nunderwriter on the shortlisted RBS social bond; and as a one of the group of\nfive underwriting banks on the Pinewood Studios \u00a3550 million high yield\noffering. Away from the shortlist, the team also acted as a manager on an\ninnovative green hybrid bond by Engie. It was an impressive showing when\npitted against the other heavyweight shortlisted teams.\n\n**In-house equity**\n\n **JP Morgan**\n\nJP Morgan just about pips its competitors to the post with a series of key\nroles on high-impact transactions throughout the year. The in-house team\nsupported the bank as one of three leads on the Huatai Securities IPO, which\npicked up equity deal of the year. The bank also one of four joint global\ncoordinator roles on the Traton IPO, a deal that raised myriad challenging\ncross-border underwriter questions. Away from the shortlist some of its other\nkey deals included the EQT Partners IPO and the Network International IPO,\nwhere the bank acted as one of seven underwriters.  \n\n**NATIONAL FIRMS OF THE YEAR**\n\n **Austria**\n\n **Binder Gr osswang**\n\nIt was a competitive market in Austria with several of the key deals on the\nshortlists relying on complex Austrian law advice. Binder Grosswang takes the\nnational firm award this year. The firm advised Emirates NBD in relation to\nits acquisition of Turkey's DenizBank and subsidiary Austrian DenizBank AG,\nwhich operates 27 branches in Austria. The firm also provided Austrian-law\nsupport to the coordinating creditors committee (banks and funds), informal ad\nhoc creditors committee (funds), existing facility agents and the facility and\nsecurity agents in the restructuring of Steinhoff Group. Gilde Buy Out\nPartners' sale of Powerlines Group to Engie Indeo was another notable piece of\nwork.\n\n **Baltics**\n\n **Sorainen**\n\nSorainen wins Baltics firm of the year thanks to an impressive pan-Baltic\neffort. The firm was Latvian and Lithuanian counsel to the banks on Avia\nSolutions's shortlisted high yield bond. It advised JP Morgan and SEB Bank on\nairBaltic's bond, one of the first under the new Prospectus Regulation. The\ntransaction made airBaltic the first CEE airline to access the eurobond\nmarket. The firm teamed up with the EBRD to produce a foundational paper for a\npan-Baltic legal framework for covered bonds. The firm also advised on the\nfirst private placement by a public fund in Estonia (Baltic Horizon Fund).\n\n**Belgium**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nClifford Chance has a top-class Belgium-law offering across the board. The\nteam advised the coordinating committee of lenders on the restructuring of\nEuronext Brussels-listed Nyrstar. The case has set precedents for Belgian\ninsolvency law and FSMA (Belgian market regulator). The team advised the\nbuying consortium in the complex acquisition of Euroports, which also included\nan especially novel financing structure. The team worked on multiple\ninnovative deals for the market, including the sale of Brussels Airport,\nseveral PPP financings (Liege Tram and Liefkenshoek), margin loans (Cofinimmo\nand KBC Ancora) and capital markets deals (the AB InBev tender offer and\nSolvay bond issue).\n\n **Bulgaria**\n\n **Wolf Theiss**\n\nWolf Theiss tested market frameworks in several Bulgarian sectors. In\nrenewables, it advised Alcinda on the acquisition of seven PV projects across\nBulgaria. The deal had to consolidate a mix of electricity tariff regimes and\ndifferent grid access rules. It was structured under new regulations\nintroducing a mandatory sale regime on the power exchange and a framework\nenabling the Bulgaria's renewable energy fund system to compensate the\ndifference between the market price and the former tariff levels. These issues\nrequired detailed assessments linked to the financing package. In ICT, the\nteam advised ALSO Holding on its complex acquisition of Solytron Bulgaria.\n\n **Czech**\n\n **Allen & Overy**\n\nThe Czech market is always highly competitive but Allen & Overy takes the win\nthis year. The team advised the banks on the unique loan and high yield bond\nfinancing behind Sazka Group's acquisition of Greek gaming and lottery\noperator OPAP, which is a great example of cross-border coordination between\ndifferent legal regimes. The team advised the banks on a loan to Bike Fun, the\nfirst facility based on the euro short-term rate (\u20acSTR) in the Czech Republic.\nIt also helped JP Morgan structure the first subordinated tier two capital\nbond issuance by a Czech bank (Moneta Money Bank) under the new Prospectus\nRegulation.\n\n **Denmark**\n\n **Plesner**\n\nPlesner remains a class act in Denmark. Among notable work, the firm provided\nDanish law advice on Bain Capital's acquisition of Kantar from WPP. It acted\nfor EQT and its portfolio company Sivantos on Sivantos's merger with Widex, a\ndeal that spanned 125 jurisdictions and saw EQT become a co-owner of the\ncombined business. It was one of the most complex M&A transactions ever\ncarried out in Denmark. The firm also advised Zeeland Pharma, the only Danish\ncompany dual-listed in Copenhagen and New York, on the first private placement\nof shares by a dual-listed company in Denmark.\n\n **Finland**\n\n **Roschier**\n\nIn another competitive market, Roschier scoops the award. Two deals stand out.\nThe firm acted as lead counsel to Helsinki and Stockholm-listed Tieto\nCorporation on its cross-border statutory merger with Norwegian Evry. It\nrepresents the first ever statutory cross-border merger between two listed\ncompanies in Finland. Roschier also advised an Anta Sports, FountainVest\nPartners, Chip Wilson and Tencent consortium on its public offer for Amer\nSports Corporation. This is Finland's biggest cash tender offer and its first\nlarge-scale consortium deal. The structure covered novel legal issues, from\nbreak-fee escrow arrangements to Hong Kong SAR/Finnish stock exchange\ncoordination.\n\n **France**\n\n **White & Case**\n\nWhite & Case wins France's most innovative national firm partly off the back\nof two shortlisted deals. These are the Verallia IPO and the Societe Generale\nand Mariner Investment Group impact risk transfer. Both break new ground with\ntheir approaches to ESG. Verallia's IPO was the first in Europe under the new\nProspectus Regulation. The company placed ESG front and centre of the listing\nprocess and structuring and took a novel approach to cornerstone investment.\nThe Mariner deal is a landmark, notable for its size and international scope\nfor a deal entirely under French law. It is also a pathfinder for ESG.\n\n**Germany**\n\n **Hengeler Mueller**\n\nHengeler Mueller wins Germany's most innovative national firm of the year for\n2020. Among its shortlisted roles, the firm advised Northvolt on the JV with\nGigafactory and Gerry Weber's supervisory board on the company's\nrestructuring. Hengeler's M&A practice impressed, with instrumental roles\nadvising Vodafone on its acquisition of Liberty Global's CEE operations,\nInnogy on its sale by its parent (RWE) of a 76.8% stake to E.ON (an extremely\nchallenging deal) and Deutsche Borse on its complex acquisition of Axioma. The\nfinance team advised JP Morgan on the acquisition financing behind SAP's\nacquisition of Qualtrics.\n\n**Greece**\n\n **Zepos & Yannopoulos**\n\nThe pivotal role Zepos & Yannopoulos has played in reshaping Greece's\nfinancial sector through NPL resolution is undeniable. For context, Greece's\nfour systemic banks, plus one mid-sized bank, held \u20ac106.5 billion in NPEs in\nMarch 2016, and nearly \u20ac82 billion in December 2018 (against a GDP of \u20ac191\nbillion). This makes NPL resolution a key systemic issue. Zepos has been\npioneering with regards to the Greek securitisation law and has orchestrated\nnumerous firsts. 2019 was again illustrative of this, where the firm was\ninstrumental in the Piraeus Bank \\- Intrum transaction, acting for Intrum, and\nadvised Eurobank Ergasias on its NPL mortgage securitisation.\n\n **Hungary**\n\n **Dentons**\n\nIt was a competitive market for Hungary but Dentons again takes the win. Among\nits notable work, the firm advised Vascular Plazma Group on the sale of a 100%\nstake in Vascular Plazma Kft to Shire International through a competitive\nauction process. The firm also advised K&H Bank and OTP Bank on three long-\nterm project financings for solar park portfolios in Hungary. The pathfinder\nprojects are built by ReneSola. The financing entailed complex work on the\nsecurity granted to the lenders. The two K&H-financed projects became cross-\ncollateralised, resulting in a cross-guarantee agreement with over 30 parties.\n\n **Ireland**\n\n **Arthur Cox**\n\nA&L Goodbody and Arthur Cox stole the show in the Irish market, but Arthur Cox\ntakes the accolade. The team played a pivotal role in Henderson Park's\nacquisition of Green REIT, the restructurings of Ballantyne Re and Asia Pulp\nPaper Group, and the Eurobank Ergasias NPL mortgage securitisation. It also\nworked on Stenn's trade receivables securitisation, Merlin Entertainments'\nhigh yield bond and the Mulcair Securities securitisation. Other notable\ntransactions included structuring an innovative phased buyback programme by\nCRH, the Dutch auction tender offer by Johnson Controls, the restructuring of\nWeatherford Group, and the Epiris/IFG Group takeover.\n\n **Israel**\n\n **Fischer Behar Chen Well Orion & Co**\n\nThe FBC & Co team was instrumental in the landmark sale of Leumi Card, where\nit represented Bank Leumi and the Azrieli Group on its sale to Warburg Pincus\nand subsequent block trade sale of the remaining stake to Citigroup. In\nanother highly regulated field, the firm advised Centerbridge Partners and\nGallatin Point Capital on its acquisition of insurer Phoenix Holdings from the\nDelek Group. The firm played key roles on the IPO of the Tel Aviv Stock\nExchange, the bond offering by Strawberry Fields REIT, and a complex mezzanine\nsyndicated financing to Ithaca Energy.\n\n**Italy**\n\n **Latham & Watkins **\n\nLatham & Watkins Italy led on at least two landmark transactions. The team\nadvised Carlyle Group on the M&A, financing, competition and regulatory\naspects of its \u20ac1 billion acquisition of aerospace and defence company\nForgital. The deal required approval from Italian and French authorities under\nthe 'golden power' regimes and the financing bond constituted the first ever\nItalian co-issuer structure, designed to facilitate an offering into the US.\nThe firm also advised Bain Capital Credit on a first-of-its-kind distressed\ninvestment into Giuseppe Bottiglieri, in which Bain assumed all the target's\nliabilities. The deal entailed several unprecedented aspects and set a new\nmarket standard.\n\n **Luxembourg**\n\n **Arendt & Medernach**\n\nStill fresh after 30 years of practice, Arendt & Medernach worked on four\nshortlisted deals. This complements its other pioneering work in the crypto\nand funds spaces. One European landmark deal saw the firm advise the joint\nlead managers on the EIB's \u20acSTR bond. The firm helped advise Bain Capital on\nthe financing package (bond and loan) for its acquisition of Kantar and served\nas local counsel to the ad hoc group of senior unsecured notes in the\nGalapagos restructuring. Other deals saw the firm advise Finerge Group on a\ncomplex refinancing and the sellers on the sale of Euroports.\n\n**Netherlands**\n\n **NautaDutilh**\n\nNautaDutilh is no stranger to this award. In 2019 the firm provided Dutch law\nadvice on two shortlisted transactions. These were the financing of Bain\nCapital's acquisition of Kantar from WPP and the restructuring of Lebara,\nwhere the firm's expertise was critical in leading the bondholders and Dutch\ncourts through a relatively untested enforcement process. Other standout work\nsaw the firm advise De Volksbank on a debut \u20ac500 million green bonds issue. A\nteam also advised Blokker Holding on its sale to the current CEO Michiel\nWitteveen. This employed complex payment mechanics which comprised uniquely\nringfenced and strictly timetabled, tranched payments.\n\n **Norway**\n\n **Thommessen**\n\nTop-tier firm Thommessen wins the 2020 national firm award for Norway. The\nfirm worked on Var Energi's acquisition of ExxonMobil's upstream Norwegian\nassets, which entailed novel handling of the seller's secondary liability for\ndecommissioning through a guarantee between Var Energi and ExxonMobil Norge's\nDutch parents. Thomas H Lee Partners' acquisition of AutoStore include\nfeatures such as soft-stapled W&I [warranties and indemnities] insurance and\nacquisition financing, and a locked-box mechanism with no post-closing\npurchase price adjustments. The firm was also lead counsel in Kongsberg\nGruppen's acquisition of Rolls-Royce Commercial Marine; a carveout from the\nRolls-Royce Group that involved direct transfers in around 15 countries.\n\n**Poland**\n\n **Clifford Chance**\n\nThe Polish market is incredibly competitive and dynamic, but Clifford Chance\nwins the 2020 firm award. The team advised Bank Millennium on its agreement\nwith Societe Generale for the acquisition of Euro Bank. The transaction breaks\nwith standard banking sector M&A structures, which usually involve spinning\noff the target's CHF portfolio into a separate company that is kept by the\nseller post-transaction. The firm also advised OTL Group in its restructuring.\nThis included bilateral standstill-type agreements with lenders and\nbondholders, a new series of secured bonds, a first-of-its-kind rollover\nprocedure negotiated with the Polish National Depository for Securities, and a\nfirst-of-its-type intercreditor agreement the lenders.\n\n **Portugal**\n\n **Morais Leit ao Galvao Teles Soares da Silva & Associados**\n\nMorais Leitao sponsored an impressive range of deal innovations in 2019. The\nfirm advised Banco Comercial Portugues (Millennium bcp) on the first AT1 issue\nby a Portuguese private bank. It worked on the Republic of Portugal's\ninaugural panda bond issuance, making it the first eurozone sovereign to issue\nChinese law-governed debt. The firm advised Portugal-listed Inapa on its\nacquisition of Papyrus Group in Germany, which featured a novel price\nstructure, and Funda\u00e7ao Calouste Gulbenkian on the sale of Partex to PTT\nExploration and Production (PTTEP), which signs off two years of work. The\nfirm also worked with Sonae Sierra/Bankinter on establishing the first REIT in\nPortugal.\n\n **Romania**\n\n **Clifford Chance Badea**\n\nClifford Chance Badea wins Romania firm of the year. The team advised joint\nbookrunners Morgan Stanley and UniCredit on the eurobond offering by UniCredit\nLeasing Corporation. The deal resolved several complex legal issues and\nentailed tight coordination across different jurisdictions. Also in the debt\ncapital markets, the firm advised Alpha Bank Romania on the first covered bond\nprogramme established in Romania. Other notable transactions included REWE's\nacquisition of the travel agency arm of Eurolines Romania and AEW's sale of\ntwo key real estate assets, which required in-depth work on the financing\nmechanisms.\n\n**Russia**\n\n **Herbert Smith Freehills**\n\nHerbert Smith Freehills CIS put in an impressive show in 2019. One of its\nhighlights was advising Sberbank of Russia on the sale of Denizbank to\nEmirates NBD though its disposal of a 99.85% stake; a true landmark\ntransaction for the Russian and Turkish markets. The team advised VTB Bank on\nits acquisition of RTC Group (Rustranscom) and acted for Familia, Goldman\nSachs, Baring Vostok and two founders on the sale of a 25% stake in Familia to\nTJX. It is the first large US PE investment in a Russian consumer retail\nbusiness since the imposition of western sanctions and involved 275 stores in\n90 Russian cities.\n\n **Spain**\n\n **Garrigues**\n\nThere was again a competitive Spanish market, with innovative work across the\nspectrum. Garrigues provided the Spanish law piece for Bain Capital's\nacquisition of Kantar and served as Spanish advisor to the sponsor in the\ngroundbreaking Prosil Acquisition NPL securitisation. A highlight in the\nsecuritisation market saw Garrigues advise Banco de Sabadell on a consumer\nloans securitisation through a Spanish _fondo de titulizaci on_. Sabadell was\noriginator and seller and the deal marked the first securitisation in Europe\nof consumer loans in which all the tranches of the securitisation were sold\npublicly. The transaction resolved a vast number of complex legal issues.\n\n**Sweden**\n\n **Vinge**\n\nVinge advised the underwriters on Vattenfall's debut green bond, the first\nlisting of bonds under a Swedish EMTN programme on Nasdaq Stockholm. Vinge was\nalso lead counsel to EQT on its IPO, which included several innovative\nfeatures (for example, a tailored five-year lock-up). The firm advised Lendify\non the market's first variable funding notes issue, which was also the first\nSwedish securitisation under the EU Securitisation Regulation.

Among the highlights, the firm acted as\nglobal lead to Credit Suisse on its bail-inable notes and advised Ernst Gohner\nFoundation in relation to the acquisition of Panalpina Group by DSV.

It acted for a vast consortium of\nlenders on the Turkey Wealth Fund's (TWF) \u20ac1 billion term loan syndication.\nThis was a vitally significant financing for Turkey, and it had to navigate\nchallenging public laws relating to TWF's legal status, legal restraints\napplicable to TWF's debt, and a treasury guarantee.

To be considered, all deals must meet specific criteria that make them both cross-border and European. They must also have completed in 2019 - we do not include announced or signed deals.</p><p>Given the difficult global environment, we are unable to host a ceremony to celebrate the work highlighted below. However, we believe it is as important as ever to recognise the achievements, the legal ingenuity and potential for innovation that the market will depend on going forward. </p><p><b>Please also listen to our first ever awards podcast, where we discuss research highlights and some of the themes that emerged during the process.</b></p><p><b>Please note: </b>we will be releasing a series of podcasts covering the IFLR awards for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia-Pacific</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/am\">Americas</location> and look out for other awards-related podcast interviews in the pipeline.

It was also the first company to amend legacy debt to replace Libor with Sonia, setting a benchmark for the market. This transaction is the seminal deal for migrating legacy bonds into Sonia and established an approach on issues such as the application of a spread adjustment and the treatment of consent solicitation fees. The latter were waived, which presented a key precedent. The consent solicitation was tightly timed to avoid having to create an alternative pricing methodology or an adjustment to the interpolated basis. ABP made the documentation freely available. </p><p><b>Law firms</b></p><p><person>Clifford Chance</person> - <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LSE:93OT\">NatWest Markets</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4034103967\">Deutsche Trustee Company</org><br /><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1470367533\">Linklaters</org> - ABP</p><p><b>Equity</b></p><p><b>Huatai Securities IPO</b></p><p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Shanghai:601688\">Huatai Securities</org> is the first Chinese company to offer global depository receipts (GDRs) representing its shares in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> and the first to be conducted under the new Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme, which directly links the Chinese and European capital markets by providing a two-way fungibility mechanism between securities listed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..shangh\">Shanghai</location>.
