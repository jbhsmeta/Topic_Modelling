McDaniel said gross receipts to the treasury in May were <money>$923.1 million</money>, which was 14.1% or <money>$150.5 million</money> less than the same month a year ago.

Gross receipts to the treasury are all taxes paid to the state, including those collected on behalf of local governments and money subsequently returned to taxpayers as refunds and rebates. \"The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ok\">Oklahoma</location> economy, as reflected in state revenue collections, was significantly impacted by the pandemic during the month,\" McDaniel said in a news release.
