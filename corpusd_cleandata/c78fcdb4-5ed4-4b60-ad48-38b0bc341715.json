    "text": "ATLANTA \u0096 Two Atlanta police officers who were captured on video forcibly\npulling a pair of college students out of their car and placing them under\narrest during protests Saturday night, May 30 have been fired, Mayor Keisha\nLance Bottoms announced Sunday, May 31.\n\nThe two students were in downtown Atlanta during during the second night of\nprotests in the city over the death of George Floyd. In the incident, the two\nstudents were pulled from the car, stunned and arrested. FOX 5 learned one of\nthe students is enrolled at Spelman College and the other is enrolled at\nMorehouse College. Both were released from police custody Sunday.\n\nAddressing the events from that night, the mayor called the video\n\"disturbing.\"\n\n\"There clearly was an excessive use of force. We understand that our officers\nare working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress, but we also\nunderstand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable,\" Bottoms said\nduring a news conference Sunday evening.\n\nFive officers were involved in the incident. The three remaining officers have\nbeen assigned to desk duty pending an investigation, the mayor said. Mayor\nBottoms said police body camera video from the incident would be released to\nthe media.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Erika Shields specifically addressed the incident with\nthe two college students, stating that her officers had a responsibility not\nto escalate any incident.\n\n\"These folks are going out everyday, they are getting pelted with rocks,\nknives thrown at them, ongoing gun shots, it really is an unpleasent space to\nbe in. But that does not relieve us of our repsonsibilities. And we have a\nresponsibility, when we handle any incident, not to escalate the incident and\nnot to cause further harm or injury,\" Shields said.\n\nThe mayor extended a 9 p.m. curfew for the city of Atlanta through Sunday\nnight. Bottoms had previously signed an order establishing a curfew for the\ncity through Saturday night, which ended at sunrise on Sunday. The mayor\ncalled the curfew a \"very unusual and extreme step.\"\n\nMARTA announced it would be suspending all rail, bus, and paratransit services\nat 9 p.m. Sunday as a result of the curfew.\n\nSaturday night's protests began peacefully, but slowly escalated as\ndemonstrators went home and rioters remained behind. City officials had\nalreayd stated there would be a zero-tolerance policy in regards to violence\nafter the peaceful protests.\n\nDuring the violence, an APD officer was struck by someone riding an ATV. The\nofficer was take to Grady Memorial hospital and was being treated in the ICU.\nChief Shields said they are hoping he will have the ability to walk again.\n\nThe governor authorized up to 3,000 members of the National Guard to assist in\ncontrolling protests in cities across the state.\n\nAs of Sunday, Atlanta police had arrested more than 150 people related to the\nprotests.\n\nThe demonstrations are in response to the death of George Floyd, who was\nkllled while in police custody in Minneapolis.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the white police officer who worked for the Minneapolis Police\nDepartment, is charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter\nin Floyd's death.\n\nFloyd died after the 44-year-old Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for\nseveral minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n33.748995 -84.387982",
