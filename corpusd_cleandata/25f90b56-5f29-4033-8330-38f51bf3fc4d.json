    "text": "My name is Dave Stauffer and I'm running for District 1 Mitchell County\nsupervisor. I have lived, worked and raised a family in Mitchell County for 42\nyears. During this time, I have taught school and coached; worked as an\nelection official, hail adjuster, house painter, umpire and referee, and for a\nlocal farmer. From my time as a paper boy to retiring after 40 years in\neducation, I have worked and communicated with people.\n\nBeing concerned about county spending and establishing priorities to make the\nbest use of tax payer funds prompted me to become interested in the County\nSupervisor position. For example, I support programs for our youth, senior\ncitizens, health care, conservation, good roads, quality housing, parks and\ncamping areas, law enforcement, and hometown businesses. We need to improve\nthe county's ability to attract new employers and jobs without putting the\nfinancial burden on the tax payer.\n\nTIF (Tax Increment Financing) is a big issue in our county. Supervisors have a\nresponsibility of educating themselves and others of its implications (pros\nand cons) so that wise decisions are made.\n\nIt's always easier to spend someone else's money. Needs must come before\nwants. It is time to reduce our county's debt. Five supervisors allows for\nadded voices to solve problems and make good decisions. I plan to work hard to\nsee that our county moves forward using common sense and fiscal\nresponsibility. The job of county supervisor is a challenge that I am willing\nto take. I will be a strong voice for Osage and all of Mitchell County. I\nwould appreciate your support.\n\nDavid Stauffer, Osage",

    "html": "<p>My name is <person>Dave Stauffer</person> and I'm running for District 1 Mitchell County supervisor. I have lived, worked and raised a family in Mitchell County for 42 years. During this time, I have taught school and coached; worked as an election official, hail adjuster, house painter, umpire and referee, and for a local farmer. From my time as a paper boy to retiring after 40 years in education, I have worked and communicated with people.</p>\n<p>Being concerned about county spending and establishing priorities to make the best use of tax payer funds prompted me to become interested in the County Supervisor position. For example, I support programs for our youth, senior citizens, health care, conservation, good roads, quality housing, parks and camping areas, law enforcement, and hometown businesses. We need to improve the county's ability to attract new employers and jobs without putting the financial burden on the tax payer.</p>\n\n<p>TIF (Tax Increment Financing) is a big issue in our county. Supervisors have a responsibility of educating themselves and others of its implications (pros and cons) so that wise decisions are made.</p>\n\n<p>It's always easier to spend someone else's money. Needs must come before wants. It is time to reduce our county's debt. Five supervisors allows for added voices to solve problems and make good decisions. I plan to work hard to see that our county moves forward using common sense and fiscal responsibility. The job of county supervisor is a challenge that I am willing to take. I will be a strong voice for Osage and all of Mitchell County. I would appreciate your support.</p>\n\n<p><person>David Stauffer</person>, Osage</p>",
