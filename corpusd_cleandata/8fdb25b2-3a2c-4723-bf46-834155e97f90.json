    "text": "Understand that the president of the United States is not a person like the\nrest of us. POTUS is a national asset that belongs to and exists for the U.S.\nTrump's handlers can (legally) and should treat him as such.\n\nUnderstand that, until researchers complete the full study, we can only go\nwith what we know about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19. Trump taking a\npotentially deadly drug poses a clear and present threat to U.S. national\nsecurity. We have to wonder what those closest to our president - the folks\nsupplying him with hydroxychloroquine - are thinking.\n\nA significant pilot study on the drug President Donald Trump is taking has\nalready been completed and published. Researchers looked at medical records\nfrom 15,000-plus cases of COVID-19 patients at more than 600 facilities who\nwere given chloroquine drugs. They also looked at 80,000 COVID-19 patients\nworldwide who were not given the drugs.\n\nIn every case, patients who took the drug were more likely to die or develop\nheart problems than those who did not take the drug.\n\nWe all know that pilot studies are designed to simply and efficiently\nestablish justification for further study; they don't generalize or draw\nconclusions. Yet, we also know that it's exceedingly rare for a pilot study\nwith this level of significance to end up totally bogus.\n\nBeing a pilot study is not a reason to ignore the information; quite the\nopposite. It should also be noted that neither of these drugs have been tested\nor piloted and shown to function as a preventative for COVID-19; the\nresearchers only looked at patients with verified positive cases.\n\nSo, why would anyone encourage and enable a \"healthy\" person to use a\npotentially deadly drug for something it wasn't intended and for which it\nhasn't been tested? Are they so afraid of COVID-19 that they're willing to\nrisk national security by allowing a reckless POTUS to take a dangerous and\npotentially deadly drug? Or are they not scared of COVID-19 at all and, yet,\nstill willing to supply the president with a dangerous and potentially deadly\ndrug?\n\nIs this ignorance or something worse?\n\nMichael J.

POTUS is a national asset that belongs to and exists for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Trump's handlers can (legally) and should treat him as such.</p>\n<p>Understand that, until researchers complete the full study, we can only go with what we know about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19. Trump taking a potentially deadly drug poses a clear and present threat to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> national security. We have to wonder what those closest to our president - the folks supplying him with hydroxychloroquine - are thinking.</p>\n\n<p>A significant pilot study on the drug President <person>Donald Trump</person> is taking has already been completed and published. Researchers looked at medical records from 15,000-plus cases of COVID-19 patients at more than 600 facilities who were given chloroquine drugs. They also looked at 80,000 COVID-19 patients worldwide who were not given the drugs.</p>\n\n<p>In every case, patients who took the drug were more likely to die or develop heart problems than those who did not take the drug.</p>\n\n<p>We all know that pilot studies are designed to simply and efficiently establish justification for further study; they don't generalize or draw conclusions. Yet, we also know that it's exceedingly rare for a pilot study with this level of significance to end up totally bogus.</p>\n\n<p>Being a pilot study is not a reason to ignore the information; quite the opposite. It should also be noted that neither of these drugs have been tested or piloted and shown to function as a preventative for COVID-19; the researchers only looked at patients with verified positive cases.</p>\n\n<p>So, why would anyone encourage and enable a \"healthy\" person to use a potentially deadly drug for something it wasn't intended and for which it hasn't been tested? Are they so afraid of COVID-19 that they're willing to risk national security by allowing a reckless POTUS to take a dangerous and potentially deadly drug? Or are they not scared of COVID-19 at all and, yet, still willing to supply the president with a dangerous and potentially deadly drug?</p>\n\n<p>Is this ignorance or something worse?</p>\n\n<p><person>Michael J.
