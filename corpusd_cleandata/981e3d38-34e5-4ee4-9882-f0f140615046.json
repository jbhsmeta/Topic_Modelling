    "text": "JUNE 1, 2020 \u0096 Foresight and hustle. On the basketball court, Katie Lewis was\nalways thinking about the next game, the next possession, the next play, and\nat the same time she was right in the action giving her all. She needed those\nqualities to complete her degree in health sciences at Greensboro College. She\nneeded them to face some personal crises. She needed them to weather a global\npandemic.\n\nCoach Randy Tuggle was a big reason the Southeast Guilford High School\ngraduate chose Greensboro College. \"Coach Tuggle came to talk to me. He lived\nin Greensboro too, so he knew I didn't want to leave my family and all the\nsupport I had here. He gave me that little push to want more and made me\ninterested,\" Lewis says. Still it seemed like a stretch. \"Say Yes helped me a\nlot. Greensboro College is a private school, so it has definitely helped me\nmanage that and make it more affordable; and it gave me the option to play\nbasketball too.\"\n\nLewis enrolled at Greensboro College in the fall of 2016 as one of the first\nSay Yes Guilford Scholars. She played for Tuggle all four years, scoring more\nthan 1000 points for the Pride. The team was her second family. Lewis\nremembers Coach Tuggle sharing with them that he had been diagnosed with\npancreatic cancer; her mother had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\"This past year has been really hard for basketball and my family, but our\nentire team has been more connected, more of a family because of that. We're\nstronger because of the whole situation.\"\n\nAs graduation approached, both Mom and Coach were doing well. Lewis was\nkeeping up with her studies, working at a local restaurant and interning at a\nphysical therapy practice. She could see her dreams right in front of her.\nThen COVID-19 brought everything to a halt. In-person classes were canceled,\nso she set herself up to work at home. The restaurant where she worked closed,\nshe took a job as a personal shopper at Walmart. Her internship ended, but the\npracticed offered her a position as a physical therapy tech when they reopen.\n\n\"I have a lot of opportunities,\" Lewis says. \"This college has definitely\ngiven me a lot of connections.\" When basketball returns you might see her back\non the court. Not as a player, but as a referee. \"Coach Tuggle has offered to\nhelp me.\" Family sticks together. Foresight and hustle. Lewis learned those\nqualities on the court, but the whole college experience showed her another\nquality she had \u0096 heart, and she plans to follow hers. \"I'm really blessed.\"\n\nGreensboro College is one of more than 100 private colleges and universities\nin the Say Yes Guilford Higher Education Compact. Compact schools agree to\nensure that students whose annual family income is at or below $75,000 are\ntypically eligible, at a minimum, to attend tuition and fee-free, provided\nthey successfully navigate the institution's regular admission process.\n\nSay Yes Guilford encourages every GCS senior to register for the scholarships.\nToday is the last day to register at\n[sayyesguilford.org/scholarshipregistration](http://sayyesguilford.org/scholarshipregistration).\nSeniors should also indicate their 2020-21 school enrollment today.\n\nSince its inception, Say Yes Guilford has awarded over $8.6 million to GCS\ngraduates, and our partnership with over 100 private colleges and universities\nprovided another $11.3 million for a total impact of over $20 million.\n\nSay Yes Guilford is committed to providing access to support services and\nscholarships designed to prepare Guilford County Schools' students for success\nin college, career and life.",

    "html": "<p><chron>JUNE 1, 2020</chron> &#150; Foresight and hustle. On the basketball court, <person>Katie Lewis</person> was always thinking about the next game, the next possession, the next play, and at the same time she was right in the action giving her all. She needed those qualities to complete her degree in health sciences at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4169589376\">Greensboro College</org>. She needed them to face some personal crises. She needed them to weather a global pandemic.</p>\n<p>Coach <person>Randy Tuggle</person> was a big reason the <org>Southeast Guilford High School</org> graduate chose <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4169589376\">Greensboro College</org>. \"<person>Coach Tuggle</person> came to talk to me. He lived in Greensboro too, so he knew I didn't want to leave my family and all the support I had here. He gave me that little push to want more and made me interested,\" Lewis says. Still it seemed like a stretch. \"Say Yes helped me a lot. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4169589376\">Greensboro College</org> is a private school, so it has definitely helped me manage that and make it more affordable; and it gave me the option to play basketball too.\"</p>\n\n<p>Lewis enrolled at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4169589376\">Greensboro College</org> in the fall of 2016 as one of the first Say Yes Guilford Scholars. She played for Tuggle all four years, scoring more than 1000 points for the Pride. The team was her second family. Lewis remembers <person>Coach Tuggle</person> sharing with them that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; her mother had just been diagnosed with breast cancer. \"This past year has been really hard for basketball and my family, but our entire team has been more connected, more of a family because of that. We're stronger because of the whole situation.\"</p>\n\n<p>As graduation approached, both Mom and Coach were doing well. Lewis was keeping up with her studies, working at a local restaurant and interning at a physical therapy practice. She could see her dreams right in front of her. Then COVID-19 brought everything to a halt. In-person classes were canceled, so she set herself up to work at home. The restaurant where she worked closed, she took a job as a personal shopper at Walmart. Her internship ended, but the practiced offered her a position as a physical therapy tech when they reopen.</p>\n\n<p>\"I have a lot of opportunities,\" Lewis says. \"This college has definitely given me a lot of connections.\" When basketball returns you might see her back on the court. Not as a player, but as a referee. \"<person>Coach Tuggle</person> has offered to help me.\" Family sticks together. Foresight and hustle. Lewis learned those qualities on the court, but the whole college experience showed her another quality she had &#150; heart, and she plans to follow hers. \"I'm really blessed.\"</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4169589376\">Greensboro College</org> is one of more than 100 private colleges and universities in the Say Yes Guilford Higher Education Compact. Compact schools agree to ensure that students whose annual family income is at or below <money>$75,000</money> are typically eligible, at a minimum, to attend tuition and fee-free, provided they successfully navigate the institution's regular admission process.</p>\n\n<p>Say Yes Guilford encourages every GCS senior to register for the scholarships. Today is the last day to register at <a href=\"http://sayyesguilford.org/scholarshipregistration\">sayyesguilford.org/scholarshipregistration</a>. Seniors should also indicate their 2020-21 school enrollment today.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, Say Yes Guilford has awarded over <money>$8.6 million</money> to GCS graduates, and our partnership with over 100 private colleges and universities provided another <money>$11.3 million</money> for a total impact of over <money>$20 million</money>.</p>\n\n<p>Say Yes Guilford is committed to providing access to support services and scholarships designed to prepare <org>Guilford County Schools'</org> students for success in college, career and life.</p>",
