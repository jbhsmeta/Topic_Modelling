    "text": "SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. \\- Local plant-based cooking and nutrition instructor\nDeb Czech is teaming up with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine\nto bring online classes to Capital Region residents.\n\nThe Food for Life classes help people improve their health through a plant-\nbased diet.\n\nDesigned by physicians, nurses, and registered dietitians, Food for Life is an\naward-winning nutrition education and cooking class program that provides an\ninnovative approach to diet-related chronic diseases.\n\nSince 2001, Food for Life has been a pioneer in delivering hands-on\ninformation about the direct role of plant-based nutrition in health and\ndisease prevention to communities around the world.\n\nCzech is the owner of Planted Platter of Saratoga Springs, a business\nproviding plant-based programs to individuals, workplaces, and food service\noperations. She became a licensed Food for Life instructor with the Physicians\nCommittee in 2019 and has been a plant-based eater and cook since 2012.\n\nDue to COVID-19, Food for Life classes are now being offered online for the\nfirst time. Czech and her fellow Food for Life instructors across the United\nStates and abroad will teach participants how plant-based diets can help\nachieve weight loss and prevent and sometimes reverse chronic diseases,\nincluding heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nPlanted Platter's summer class schedule will include both day and evening\nsessions. In June, a one-hour \"lunch and learn\" series will occur from noon to\n1 p.m. on Tuesdays June 2, 9, 16 and 23.\n\nIn both June and July, from 6 to 8 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday evenings,\nclasses will cover topics such as boosting immunity and fighting cancer (June\n1-2 or July 6-7), healthy heart and blood pressure (June 8-9 or July 13-14),\nand diabetes and weight control (June 15-16 or July 20-21).\n\n\"These Food for Life classes will not only teach people the benefits of plant-\nbased eating, but also show them how to put together simple, affordable meals.\nWe will discuss strategies to shift to eating more plant foods, while\nrespecting everyone's need to make changes at their own pace,\" Czech said in a\npress release. \"With the current issues surrounding the country's meat supply\nand interest in reducing COVID-19 risks associated with underlying health\nconditions, people are especially curious right now about plant-based meal\noptions.\"\n\nEach class covers important nutrition topics with short videos from the\nPhysicians Committee's medical team followed by Czech teaching students how\nthey can put this information into practice in delicious and easy-to-prepare\nrecipes.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with\nunderlying health conditions - such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity -\nmake up the majority of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. Plant-based\ndiets are scientifically proven to prevent and even reverse many of those\ndiseases.\n\n\"We're all looking for ways to stay as healthy as we can during this\nunprecedented time,\" Susan Levin, MS, RD, director of nutrition education for\nthe Physicians Committee, said in the release. \"Food for Life classes give\npeople the tools they need to stay healthy. From the comfort of their homes,\nparticipants will learn about topics including foods that support the immune\nsystem, diabetes prevention and reversal, heart health, and maintaining a\nhealthy weight, as well as tips on planning a budget-friendly menu with pantry\nstaples.\"\n\nMore information is available online at\n[plantedplatter.com](http://plantedplatter.com) or by calling 518-350-4080.",

Czech and her fellow Food for Life instructors across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> and abroad will teach participants how plant-based diets can help achieve weight loss and prevent and sometimes reverse chronic diseases, including heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.</p>\n\n<p>Planted Platter's summer class schedule will include both day and evening sessions. In June, a one-hour \"lunch and learn\" series will occur from <chron>noon to 1 p.m. on Tuesdays</chron> <chron>June 2</chron>, 9, 16 and 23.</p>\n\n<p>In both June and July, from <chron>6 to 8 p.m. on Monday</chron> and Tuesday evenings, classes will cover topics such as boosting immunity and fighting cancer (<chron>June 1-2</chron> or <chron>July 6-7</chron>), healthy heart and blood pressure (<chron>June 8-9</chron> or <chron>July 13-14</chron>), and diabetes and weight control (<chron>June 15-16</chron> or July 20-21).</p>\n\n<p>\"These Food for Life classes will not only teach people the benefits of plant-based eating, but also show them how to put together simple, affordable meals. We will discuss strategies to shift to eating more plant foods, while respecting everyone's need to make changes at their own pace,\" Czech said in a press release. \"With the current issues surrounding the country's meat supply and interest in reducing COVID-19 risks associated with underlying health conditions, people are especially curious right now about plant-based meal options.\"</p>\n\n<p>Each class covers important nutrition topics with short videos from the Physicians Committee's medical team followed by Czech teaching students how they can put this information into practice in delicious and easy-to-prepare recipes.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</org>, people with underlying health conditions - such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity - make up the majority of COVID-19 deaths in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. Plant-based diets are scientifically proven to prevent and even reverse many of those diseases.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're all looking for ways to stay as healthy as we can during this unprecedented time,\" <person>Susan Levin</person>, MS, RD, director of nutrition education for the Physicians Committee, said in the release. \"Food for Life classes give people the tools they need to stay healthy. From the comfort of their homes, participants will learn about topics including foods that support the immune system, diabetes prevention and reversal, heart health, and maintaining a healthy weight, as well as tips on planning a budget-friendly menu with pantry staples.\"</p>\n\n<p>More information is available online at <a href=\"http://plantedplatter.com\">plantedplatter.com</a> or by calling 518-350-4080.</p>",
