    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. \\-- Richmond Police officers who sprayed tear gas on protesters\naround the Robert E. Lee monument have been pulled from the field and will be\ndisciplined for their actions, Police Chief William Smith said Monday evening.\n\n\"Chief Smith just reviewed video of gas being deployed by RPD officers near\nthe Lee Monument and apologizes for this unwarranted action,\" Richmond Police\ntweeted. \"These officers have been pulled from the field. They will be\ndisciplined because their actions were outside dept protocols and directions\ngiven.\"\n\nAs thousands of peaceful protesters marched from downtown Richmond to Monument\nAvenue on Monday night, many ended up near the Lee monument.\n\nAt about 7 :30 p.m., tear gas was fired from an area where Richmond Police\nwere stationed, toward the protestors. Many of the protestors scrambled for\ncover.\n\nRichmond Police Officers mace protestors at close range\n\n\"The police escorted the peaceful protest from the Capitol all the way down to\nthe monument. Once the other units arrived shortly after the crowd was\nteargassed without warning,\" protestor Anthony Garcia explained.\n\n\"To our peaceful protestors: We are sorry we had to deploy gas near the Lee\nMonument,\" Richmond Police tweeted. \"Some RPD officers in that area were cut\noff by violent protestors. The gas was necessary to get them to safety.\"\n\nAround 9:45 p.m. Monday evening, Richmond Police tweeted that some officers\ninvolved in Monday's tear gas incident have been pulled from the field.\n\nRichmond Mayor Levar Stoney responded on Twitter.\n\n\"To the peaceful protesters who were gassed tonight, please come. I want to\napologize in person,\" he tweeted.\n\nState Seantor Jennifer McClellan (D - Richmond) demanded more answers.\n\n\"Tear gassing peaceful protestors without warning is unacceptable,\" she wrote.\n\"We need more answers on why this happened. Witness accounts and video on the\nscene suggest this was unprovoked.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.",
