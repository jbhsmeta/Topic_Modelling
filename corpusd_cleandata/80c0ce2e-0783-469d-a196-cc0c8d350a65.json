    "text": "COAL TOWNSHIP - There is no place like home, and for many across the nation in\nthe last two months, there hasn't been any other place.\n\nWith businesses slowly beginning to mold exit strategies for the decisions\nmade relating to the coronavirus pandemic, Rock-n-Block Materials, located at\n123 Quarry Road, isn't expecting much trouble finding its own.\n\nBolstered by an increase in demand, likely due to more people staying at home\nand, in turn, wanting to improve their properties, business owner Linda\nMorgante said Rock-n-Block is currently holding a strong list of orders to\nfulfill and she doesn't expect things to change as the construction season\nkicks into full swing.\n\nCelebrating its 15th year in business, Morgante said her operation prides\nitself on superior customer service and offering convenient hours - open seven\ndays a week from April through September.\n\nThe business hosts one of the largest displays of outdoor products in the\narea, spanning more than 7,000 square feet of pavers and walls in different\ntextures, sizes and colors.\n\nMorgante said one of Rock-n-Block's biggest calling cards is its ability to\nhelp homeowners from start to finish with their landscaping projects.\n\nMickey Moroz, head salesman at the business, said the operation boasts\nrelationships with many area contractors, which it uses to pair customers with\nconstruction companies to complete landscaping projects.\n\nHe said about 60% of Rock-n-Block's business comes from homeowners, while the\nremainder is related to supplying area contractors with materials. Morgante\nsaid that business model has helped the business succeed through the COVID-19\ncrisis, which has put a strain on nearly every business in the country.\n\n\"For a few months, contractors weren't permitted to do work,\" she said. \"But\nwe still had customers calling for mulch and topsoil to do their yard work and\nthat really helped us through these times.\"\n\nMorgante said aside from the business' temporary closure due to the pandemic,\nwhich is now in the past, the company has retained all of its employees.\n\n\"I'm very thankful we've been able to do well through this,\" she said.\n\nHer experience locally with the family-owned and operated business seems to\nfollow the national trend, with media reports last month indicating sales of\nhome improvement items had skyrocketed amid stay-at-home orders taking effect.\n\nMorgante said Rock-n-Block builds relationships one block at a time by\noffering materials to enhance the exterior of area homes. The business sells\nan assortment of products to bolster the landscaping of properties, including\nmulch, stone, topsoil and fire pits.\n\nRock-n-Block is a distributor of Cambridge Pavingstones with ArmorTec, which\ncarries a transferable lifetime warranty along with Belgard with True Color,\nVersa_Lok, Hanover and Libertystone wall block and pavers.\n\nThe business is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday\nfrom 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Other hours are available\nthrough appointment, which can be set up by calling the business at\n570-644-1548.\n\nMore information on Rock-n-Block can be found on its website,\n[www.rocknblock.com](http://www.rocknblock.com), or on Facebook.",

    "html": "<p>COAL TOWNSHIP - There is no place like home, and for many across the nation in the last two months, there hasn't been any other place.</p>\n<p>With businesses slowly beginning to mold exit strategies for the decisions made relating to the coronavirus pandemic, Rock-n-Block Materials, located at <location>123 Quarry Road</location>, isn't expecting much trouble finding its own.</p>\n\n<p>Bolstered by an increase in demand, likely due to more people staying at home and, in turn, wanting to improve their properties, business owner <person>Linda Morgante</person> said Rock-n-Block is currently holding a strong list of orders to fulfill and she doesn't expect things to change as the construction season kicks into full swing.</p>\n\n<p>Celebrating its 15th year in business, Morgante said her operation prides itself on superior customer service and offering convenient hours - open seven days a week from April through September.</p>\n\n<p>The business hosts one of the largest displays of outdoor products in the area, spanning more than 7,000 square feet of pavers and walls in different textures, sizes and colors.</p>\n\n<p>Morgante said one of Rock-n-Block's biggest calling cards is its ability to help homeowners from start to finish with their landscaping projects.</p>\n\n<p><person>Mickey Moroz</person>, head salesman at the business, said the operation boasts relationships with many area contractors, which it uses to pair customers with construction companies to complete landscaping projects.</p>\n\n<p>He said about 60% of Rock-n-Block's business comes from homeowners, while the remainder is related to supplying area contractors with materials. Morgante said that business model has helped the business succeed through the COVID-19 crisis, which has put a strain on nearly every business in the country.</p>\n\n<p>\"For a few months, contractors weren't permitted to do work,\" she said. \"But we still had customers calling for mulch and topsoil to do their yard work and that really helped us through these times.\"</p>\n\n<p>Morgante said aside from the business' temporary closure due to the pandemic, which is now in the past, the company has retained all of its employees.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm very thankful we've been able to do well through this,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Her experience locally with the family-owned and operated business seems to follow the national trend, with media reports last month indicating sales of home improvement items had skyrocketed amid stay-at-home orders taking effect.</p>\n\n<p>Morgante said Rock-n-Block builds relationships one block at a time by offering materials to enhance the exterior of area homes. The business sells an assortment of products to bolster the landscaping of properties, including mulch, stone, topsoil and fire pits.</p>\n\n<p>Rock-n-Block is a distributor of Cambridge Pavingstones with ArmorTec, which carries a transferable lifetime warranty along with Belgard with True Color, Versa_Lok, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..hanver\">Hanover</location> and Libertystone wall block and pavers.</p>\n\n<p>The business is open Monday through Friday from <chron>8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</chron>, Saturday from <chron>9 a.m. to 2 p.m.</chron> and Sunday <chron>9 a.m. to 1 p.m.</chron> Other hours are available through appointment, which can be set up by calling the business at 570-644-1548.</p>\n\n<p>More information on Rock-n-Block can be found on its website, <a href=\"http://www.rocknblock.com\">www.rocknblock.com</a>, or on Facebook.</p>",
