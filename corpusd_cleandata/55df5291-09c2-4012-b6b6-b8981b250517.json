With this new approach, counties will have more flexibility to demonstrate they can safely allow additional economic activity based on targeted metrics.</p>\n<p>We are able to do this thanks to millions of Washingtonians pulling together, in the face of sacrifice and suffering, and doing their part by staying home, Inslee said during a press conference Friday. But this does not mean that we are returning to normal. It means that after three months, we are successfully moving forward.</p>\n<p>Starting on <chron>June 1</chron>, any county can apply to <person>John Wiesman</person>, secretary of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1902252002\">Washington State Department of Health</org> to move to the next phase from the phase that they are currently in. The application process will include target metrics set by the secretary and must be submitted by the county executive for review.?</p>",
