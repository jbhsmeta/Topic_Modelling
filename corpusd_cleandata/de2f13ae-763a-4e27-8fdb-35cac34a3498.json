    "text": "By BBC Monitoring\n\nBritish-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyer has expressed\nhope that the Islamic Republic's judiciary will include her in the list of\nthose to be granted state pardon, ILNA news agency reported on 5 June.\n\n\"The Judiciary has recently issued instructions based on which those with\nfive-year sentences who have already served one-third of their terms will be\npardoned. I hope this will also apply to Ms Zaghari,\" Mahmoud Behzadirad told\nILNA.\n\nOn 23 May, news agencies reported that Ayatollah Khamenei has approved a\nrequest from the Judiciary to pardon 3,721 prisoners, including a number of\nthose imprisoned for \"security\" reasons. Details of the pardon, such as the\nnames of political prisoners who might be on the list, have yet to be\npublished.\n\nBehzadirad said while the court has extended Nazanin's leave, \"nothing new has\nbeen discussed with regards to her case and the situation remains unchanged\".\n\n\"Fortunately, her leave has been extended and she is on leave wearing an ankle\ntag; we will just have to wait and see what happens next,\" the lawyer added.\n\nNazanin has been on prison leave at her parents' Tehran residence since mid-\nMarch. She was due to return to jail last week but she was informed by the\nauthorities that her temporary release had been extended until 27 May and\nduring this time a decision will be made on clemency.\n\nNazanin's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said this week that she had called the\nprosecutors' office on 30 May for an update, but \"she was told again that\nthere is still no news, and to call back again next Saturday [6 June]\".\n\nSource: BBC Monitoring 5 Jun 20",

I hope this will also apply to <person>Ms Zaghari</person>,\" Mahmoud Behzadirad told ILNA.</p>\n<p>On 23 May, news agencies reported that <person>Ayatollah Khamenei</person> has approved a request from the Judiciary to pardon 3,721 prisoners, including a number of those imprisoned for \"security\" reasons. Details of the pardon, such as the names of political prisoners who might be on the list, have yet to be published.</p>\n<p>Behzadirad said while the court has extended Nazanin's leave, \"nothing new has been discussed with regards to her case and the situation remains unchanged\".</p>\n<p>\"Fortunately, her leave has been extended and she is on leave wearing an ankle tag; we will just have to wait and see what happens next,\" the lawyer added.</p>\n<p>Nazanin has been on prison leave at her parents' <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ir..tehran\">Tehran</location> residence since mid-March. She was due to return to jail last week but she was informed by the authorities that her temporary release had been extended until 27 May and during this time a decision will be made on clemency.</p>\n<p>Nazanin's husband, <person>Richard Ratcliffe</person>, said this week that she had called the prosecutors' office on 30 May for an update, but \"she was told again that there is still no news, and to call back again next Saturday [6 June]\".</p>\n\n\n<p>\nSource: BBC Monitoring <chron>5 Jun 20</chron></p>\n</block>",
