You may hear or see profanity/offensive\nlanguage**\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (WJW) - Columbus police have identified a man who they called a\n\"person of interest\" seen at protests on Saturday.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the Ohio Statehouse and through downtown Columbus\nSaturday, demonstrating against police brutality after the death of 46-year-\nold George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody on Monday.\n\nAuthorities say that the majority of demonstrators remained peaceful, however,\nsome chose to act violently. Some individuals threw objects at police, break\nand vandalize city property, set fires to buildings and vehicles, and broke\ninto businesses.\n\n**See the video above for a look at the protest**\n\nOn Sunday, the Columbus Division of Police shared a photo on their Facebook\npage asking for the community's help in identifying a \"person of interest.\"\n\nA short time later, they said the man had been identified.\n\nTaylor Waters, an attorney who says she represents the man in the photo,\nreleased a statement to our sister station WCMH and says the version of the\nphoto and video shared by Columbus police was misleading and from an\nunreliable source.\n\nThe photos and videos CPD previously shared regarding a person of interest\nwere inaccurate and reckless. CPD shared an edited video from an unreliable\nand heavily biased source. The poster removed the portion of the video which\nclearly demonstrates a request for supplies. My client was not inciting\nviolence, my client was seeking supplies to help people who had been injured\nby police officers. He did not pay anyone to cause property damage, break any\nlaw, or otherwise cause civil unrest. He is now the target of threats and\nfears for his and his family's safety. If CPD would like to discuss this\nfurther and view the whole video, they may contact me. I have already\nattempted to reach out.\n\nTAYLOR WATERS, WATERS LEGAL LLC\n\nColumbus police report that 59 people were arrested after Saturday's protests\nand a city-wide curfew has been enacted from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m. It will\nremain in effect until Mayor Andrew Ginther chooses to rescind it.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine also activated the National Guard Saturday to assist\nColumbus police with the violence.\n\nAdditionally, all downtown streets are closed indefinitely and anyone who\nneeds to go downtown for work will be required to show ID. Anyone outside\nwithout authorization during the curfew window can be arrested.\n\nContinuing coverage, here.\n\nContinuing Coverage",

You may hear or see profanity/offensive language**</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.colbus\">COLUMBUS, Ohio</location> (WJW) - Columbus police have identified a man who they called a \"person of interest\" seen at protests on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>Protesters gathered outside the Ohio Statehouse and through downtown <person>Columbus Saturday</person>, demonstrating against police brutality after the death of 46-year-old <person>George Floyd</person>, who died in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police custody on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>Authorities say that the majority of demonstrators remained peaceful, however, some chose to act violently. Some individuals threw objects at police, break and vandalize city property, set fires to buildings and vehicles, and broke into businesses.</p>\n\n<p>**See the video above for a look at the protest**</p>\n\n<p>On Sunday, the <org>Columbus Division of Police</org> shared a photo on their Facebook page asking for the community's help in identifying a \"person of interest.\"</p>\n\n<p>A short time later, they said the man had been identified.</p>\n\n<p><person>Taylor Waters</person>, an attorney who says she represents the man in the photo, released a statement to our sister station WCMH and says the version of the photo and video shared by Columbus police was misleading and from an unreliable source.</p>\n\n<p>The photos and videos CPD previously shared regarding a person of interest were inaccurate and reckless. CPD shared an edited video from an unreliable and heavily biased source. The poster removed the portion of the video which clearly demonstrates a request for supplies. My client was not inciting violence, my client was seeking supplies to help people who had been injured by police officers. He did not pay anyone to cause property damage, break any law, or otherwise cause civil unrest. He is now the target of threats and fears for his and his family's safety. If CPD would like to discuss this further and view the whole video, they may contact me. I have already attempted to reach out.</p>\n\n<p><person>TAYLOR WATERS</person>, <org>WATERS LEGAL LLC</org></p>\n\n<p>Columbus police report that 59 people were arrested after Saturday's protests and a city-wide curfew has been enacted from <chron>10 p.m. until 6 a.m.</chron> It will remain in effect until Mayor <person>Andrew Ginther</person> chooses to rescind it.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> Governor <person>Mike DeWine</person> also activated the <org>National Guard</org>  Saturday to assist Columbus police with the violence.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, all downtown streets are closed indefinitely and anyone who needs to go downtown for work will be required to show ID.
