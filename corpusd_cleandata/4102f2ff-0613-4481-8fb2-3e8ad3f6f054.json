    "text": "Gov. Andy Beshear announced 319 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, one\nof the highest numbers the state has seen in weeks.\n\n\"The virus is still out there. I know we're tired. I know we all just want to\nhave a normal summer,\" Beshear said in a news release. \"But we've already\nsaved so many lives as Team Kentucky and we can't let up now.\"\n\nThat was the closest he came in his news release to addressing the rising\ntrend.\n\nThe last day that more than 319 cases were reported was May 5, when Beshear\nannounced 625 new cases, with 309 of them from a Western Kentucky prison and\n316 from the general public. Before that, the highest daily number of cases\nwas April 19, at 322.\n\nAfter two weeks of general decline, the state began seeing rises in cases May\n29, when 283 were reported. Including that day, seven of the last nine days\nhave had case numbers higher than 213.\n\nIt will be important to watch these numbers as the state continues to reopen\nits economy, and in the wake of protests of police violence and racial\ninjustice.\n\nMother's Day was May 10, a date that likely increased contacts among people\nwho hadn't seen each other in some time, and it was also the first Sunday that\nKentucky churches were authorized to hold in-person services. Kentucky began\nreopening its economy on May 11; that was 18 days before the numbers started\njumping, and the incubation period for the virus can be two weeks or more.\n\nBeshear has incrementally allowed new openings every few days since May 11.\nEducational and cultural activities, horse shows and some in-home childcare\nare scheduled to re-open Monday, June 8. Nightly protests in Louisville and\nLexington are into their second week.\n\nA graph created by the Lexington Herald-Leader shows that this week's total\nnumber of cases is 1,583, up from 1,133 the week ending May 30th; and 833 the\nweek ending May 23; and 1,248 the week ending May 16. Beshear displayed a\nweek-by week chart on May 28, the day before the uptick began.\n\nThe state's daily update shows that 207 of the new cases are in Kentucky's\nmost densely populated county, Jefferson, which had 65 percent of Saturday's\ntotal. The county has reported high numbers for several days, reporting 149\nnew cases on Friday and 88 new cases Saturday.\n\nThe 319 cases added Saturday brought the state's adjusted total to 11,287,\nwith at least 3,344 of them having recovered. The daily report shows that 495\npeople are in the hospital and 75 are in intensive care.\n\nBeshear announced four more covid-19 deaths: a 73-year-old man from Clay\nCounty, 73- and 90-year old men from Jefferson County, and a 70-year-old woman\nfrom Logan County. Kentucky's death toll from covid-19 is 470.\n\nThe long-term care facility update was last updated Friday, June 5. It showed\nthat 1,405 residents and 645 staff members had ever tested positive for the\nvirus, and 288 residents and three employees have died from it.\n\nKentucky Health News is an independent news service of the Institute for Rural\nJournalism and Community Issues, based in the School of Journalism and Media\nat the University of Kentucky, with support from the Foundation for a Healthy\nKentucky.",

I know we all just want to have a normal summer,\" Beshear said in a news release. \"But we've already saved so many lives as Team Kentucky and we can't let up now.\"</p>\n\n<p>That was the closest he came in his news release to addressing the rising trend.</p>\n\n<p>The last day that more than 319 cases were reported was <chron>May 5</chron>, when Beshear announced 625 new cases, with 309 of them from a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Western Kentucky</location> prison and 316 from the general public. Before that, the highest daily number of cases was <chron>April 19</chron>, at 322.</p>\n\n<p>After two weeks of general decline, the state began seeing rises in cases <chron>May 29</chron>, when 283 were reported. Including that day, seven of the last nine days have had case numbers higher than 213.</p>\n\n<p>It will be important to watch these numbers as the state continues to reopen its economy, and in the wake of protests of police violence and racial injustice.</p>\n\n<p><chron>Mother's Day</chron> was <chron>May 10</chron>, a date that likely increased contacts among people who hadn't seen each other in some time, and it was also the first Sunday that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Kentucky</location> churches were authorized to hold in-person services. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Kentucky</location> began reopening its economy on <chron>May 11</chron>; that was 18 days before the numbers started jumping, and the incubation period for the virus can be two weeks or more.</p>\n\n<p>Beshear has incrementally allowed new openings every few days since <chron>May 11</chron>. Educational and cultural activities, horse shows and some in-home childcare are scheduled to re-open <chron>Monday, June 8</chron>. Nightly protests in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.louisv\">Louisville</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.lexton\">Lexington</location> are into their second week.</p>\n\n<p>A graph created by the <org>Lexington Herald-Leader</org> shows that this week's total number of cases is 1,583, up from 1,133 the week ending <chron>May 30th</chron>; and 833 the week ending <chron>May 23</chron>; and 1,248 the week ending <chron>May 16</chron>. Beshear displayed a week-by week chart on <chron>May 28</chron>, the day before the uptick began.</p>\n\n<p>The state's daily update shows that 207 of the new cases are in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ky\">Kentucky's</location> most densely populated county, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.jefson\">Jefferson</location>, which had 65 percent of Saturday's total. The county has reported high numbers for several days, reporting 149 new cases on Friday and 88 new cases Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>The 319 cases added Saturday brought the state's adjusted total to 11,287, with at least 3,344 of them having recovered. The daily report shows that 495 people are in the hospital and 75 are in intensive care.</p>\n\n<p>Beshear announced four more covid-19 deaths: a 73-year-old man from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.clay\">Clay County</location>, 73- and 90-year old men from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.jefson\">Jefferson County</location>, and a 70-year-old woman from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ky.logan\">Logan County. Kentucky's</location> death toll from covid-19 is 470.</p>\n\n<p>The long-term care facility update was last updated <chron>Friday, June 5</chron>. It showed that 1,405 residents and 645 staff members had ever tested positive for the virus, and 288 residents and three employees have died from it.</p>\n\n<p><org>Kentucky Health News</org> is an independent news service of the <org>Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues</org>, based in the <org>School of Journalism and Media</org> at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2698931945\">University of Kentucky</org>, with support from the <org>Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky</org>.</p>",
