    "text": "PHOENIX\\--(BUSINESS WIRE)--#SecondChanceHiring--Televerde, the first and only\nfully integrated sales and marketing technology organization with a proven\nexecution model for generating demand and accelerating sales, today announced\nthat Eric Johnson, a former senior leader at Adobe-Marketo, Blackberry, Qlik\nand SAP, has been appointed to Televerde's board of directors. The appointment\nof Johnson brings Televerde's board to seven members.\n\n\"Eric is a highly respected and talented sales leader who has intimate\nunderstanding of our industry and customers. He knows how business gets done\nand his success in leading brands to meet and exceed their revenue goals is\nwell-established,\" said Morag Lucey, CEO of Televerde.\n\nJohnson retired from his position as Chief Sales Officer at Marketo where he\nled Marketo's global sales operations. Before joining Marketo, Johnson held\nseveral sales leadership positions including President of the Americas at Qlik\nTechnologies, EVP of Global Enterprise Sales at BlackBerry, SVP/General\nManager of Global Database & Technology at SAP, and SVP/General Manager of\nNorth America at Sybase. He speaks fluent German and is currently a member of\nThe New York Pops board of directors.\n\n\"As board members play a significant role in the success of a business, we\ntook our time to find the right person who would further strengthen our\nboard's talent and capabilities. We are delighted to have identified such an\noutstanding individual in Eric,\" added Lucey. \"We have no doubt that Eric's\nunique insights and experience will have an important and positive impact on\nthe growth and success of our company.\"\n\n\"I have known Televerde from the client side for more than 15 years and have\nacquired a love and appreciation for the business. The company's 25-year\nhistory of providing career opportunity and training to incarcerated women is\na world-class example of business as a force for good,\" said Johnson. \"I have\ntremendous respect for the Televerde leadership team and the other board\nmembers and I look forward to working with them.\"\n\nAbout Televerde\n\nPhoenix-based Televerde is the first and only fully integrated sales and\nmarketing technology organization with a proven execution model for generating\ndemand and accelerating sales. The company combines end-to-end sales and\nmarketing solutions to drive engagement, pipeline and revenue for the world's\nleading B2B companies including SAP, Adobe-Marketo and Pulse Secure. Since the\ncompany began in 1995, Televerde has generated $8B in revenue for its clients.\n\nA purpose-built company, Televerde believes in second chance employment and\nstrives to help disempowered people find their voice and reach their human\npotential. Seven of Televerde's 10 engagement centers are staffed by\nincarcerated women, representing 70 percent of the company's 600+ global\nworkforce. The success of this model was documented in a recent study by the\nArizona State University Seidman Research Institute. The results reveal that\nparticipants of Televerde's program go on to attain employment, earnings, and\neducation at higher rates and reoffend at significantly lower rates than other\nformerly incarcerated females in the United States.
