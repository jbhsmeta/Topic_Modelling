    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life\nScience Daily \\-- A new study on energy is now available. According to news\nreporting originating from Chengdu, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx\ncorrespondents, research stated, \"Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO [ [2] ]\n) jet fracturing is a promising alternative for shale gas fracturing instead\nof water. However, most studies pay more attention to the fracture generation\nand ignore the flow characteristic of SC-CO [ [2] ] jet fracturing in limited\nperforation scenarios.\"\n\nFunders for this research include National Key Basic Research Program For\nYouth.\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from Southwest Petroleum\nUniversity: \"To accurately explore the flow field in a limited perforation\ntunnel, a numerical model of a SC-CO [ [2] ] jet in a limited perforation\ntunnel before fracture initiation is established based on the corresponding\nengineering background. The comparison between the numerical simulation and\nexperiments has proved that the model is viable for this type of analysis. By\nusing the numerical method, the flow field of the SC-CO [ [2] ] jet fracturing\nis analyzed, and influencing factors are discussed later. The verification and\nvalidation show that the numerical model is both reliable and accurate. With\nthe dramatic fluctuating of turbulent mixing in a fully developed region,\nthere is an apparent increase in the CO [ [2] ] density and total pressure\nduring limited perforation. When the z increases from 10 times * * r* * [ [0]\n] to 145 times * * r* * [ [0] ] , the velocity on the perforation wall surface\nwould decrease below 0 m/s, resulting in backflow in the perforation tunnel.\nThe structure of the nozzle, including the outlet length and outlet diameters,\nsignificantly affects the axial velocity and boosting pressure in the\nperforation tunnel. The highest total pressure exists when the nozzle length-\nto-radius ratio is 2. The maximum velocity of the jet core drops from 138.7 to\n78 m/s, and the 'hydraulic isolating ring' starts disappearing when the radius\nchanges from 1 to 1.5 mm. It is necessary to increase the aperture ratio as\nmuch as possible to ensure pressurization but not over 1.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Based on a similar\ntheory high-speed photography results clearly show that the SC-CO [ [2] ]\ndevelops to fully jetting in only 0.07 s and a strong mixing exists in the\nannular region between the jet core and the surroundings, according with the\nnumerical simulation. This study should be helpful for scholars to\ncomprehensively understand the interaction between the SC-CO [ [2] ] jet and\nperforation, which is beneficial for studying SC-CO [ [2] ] fracturing.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: The Flow Characteristics of\nSupercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO [ [2] ] ) Jet Fracturing in Limited\nPerforation Scenarios. _Energies_ , 2020,13(2627):2627.

    "title": "Southwest Petroleum University Researchers Report Recent Findings in Energy [The Flow Characteristics of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO [ [2] ] ) Jet Fracturing in Limited Perforation Scenarios]: Energy",
    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>NewsRx Life Science Daily</org> -- A new study on energy is now available. According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..chengd\">Chengdu</location>, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO [ [2] ] ) jet fracturing is a promising alternative for shale gas fracturing instead of water. However, most studies pay more attention to the fracture generation and ignore the flow characteristic of SC-CO [ [2] ] jet fracturing in limited perforation scenarios.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Funders for this research include National Key Basic Research Program For Youth.</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from <org>Southwest Petroleum University</org>: &#8220;To accurately explore the flow field in a limited perforation tunnel, a numerical model of a SC-CO [ [2] ] jet in a limited perforation tunnel before fracture initiation is established based on the corresponding engineering background. The comparison between the numerical simulation and experiments has proved that the model is viable for this type of analysis. By using the numerical method, the flow field of the SC-CO [ [2] ] jet fracturing is analyzed, and influencing factors are discussed later. The verification and validation show that the numerical model is both reliable and accurate. With the dramatic fluctuating of turbulent mixing in a fully developed region, there is an apparent increase in the CO [ [2] ] density and total pressure during limited perforation. When the z increases from 10 times * * r* * [ [0] ] to 145 times * * r* * [ [0] ] , the velocity on the perforation wall surface would decrease below 0 m/s, resulting in backflow in the perforation tunnel. The structure of the nozzle, including the outlet length and outlet diameters, significantly affects the axial velocity and boosting pressure in the perforation tunnel. The highest total pressure exists when the nozzle length-to-radius ratio is 2. The maximum velocity of the jet core drops from 138.7 to 78 m/s, and the &#8216;hydraulic isolating ring&#8217; starts disappearing when the radius changes from 1 to 1.5 mm. It is necessary to increase the aperture ratio as much as possible to ensure pressurization but not over 1.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Based on a similar theory high-speed photography results clearly show that the SC-CO [ [2] ] develops to fully jetting in only 0.07 s and a strong mixing exists in the annular region between the jet core and the surroundings, according with the numerical simulation. This study should be helpful for scholars to comprehensively understand the interaction between the SC-CO [ [2] ] jet and perforation, which is beneficial for studying SC-CO [ [2] ] fracturing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: The Flow Characteristics of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO [ [2] ] ) Jet Fracturing in Limited Perforation Scenarios. <em>Energies</em>, 2020,13(2627):2627.
