Officers of\nthe Elkin Police Department arrived on scene as the incident was unfolding and\nMr. Boles was quickly arrested. The victim of the incident did not report any\ninjuries but there was damage to Mr. Boles' vehicle from the collision.\"\n\nBoles was driving a vehicle with Alaska plates and was originally identified\nby Elkin Police Department as being an Alaska resident. On Monday, Elkin\nPolice Chief Monroe Wagoner confirmed that Boles resides on Austin-Traphill\nRoad,\n\nA large crowd of protesters had previously gathered at the corner of Market\nand Bridge Street, starting in the vacant lot diagonally across the street\nfrom the Elkin Farmers Market, beginning about 10 a.m.\n\nThe protest soon spread to all four corners of the intersection, and at around\n11 a.m. a portion of the protesters began to march through Elkin's downtown,\ndown East Market Street to East Main Street, and turning west on Main Street.\n\nMarchers were crossing Bridge Street when Boles pulled out of the backed-up\nsouthbound traffic on Bridge Street, went into the northbound lane and\nproceeded through the intersection filled with pedestrians, according to Elkin\nPolice Chief Monroe Wagoner.\n\n\"Then he jumped out of the car with a gun,\" said Wagoner.\n\nProtest organizer West Caudle was struck by the car's mirror as it went trough\nthe intersection, according to several people at the scene.\n\nBoles was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill (NCGS\n\u00a714-32, a class E felony), going armed to the terror of the public (NCGS\n\u00a714-35.5, a misdemeanor), failure to yield to pedestrian (NCGS \u00a720-155 (c), an\ninfraction). Boles was taken before a Surry County Magistrate and given a\n$60,000 secured bond and transported to the Surry County Jail.\n\n\"Please remain peaceful. Let's finish what we came here to do,\" said Caudle to\nthe crowd after the incident. \"Dry your tears. Clean your mind of anger. We\nhave just witnessed the problems we have in this world.\"\n\nAs Boles was placed in an Elkin Police cruiser and driven away. the crowd\nchanted support for the Elkin Police Department, Caudle thanked the Elkin\ncops, Elkin Fire Department and Surry Sheriff's Department.\n\nElkin Police Department was assisted by Elkin Fire Department, the Surry\nCounty Sheriff's Office, the Jonesville Police Department and Surry County\nEmergency Services.",

Let&#8217;s finish what we came here to do,&#8221; said Caudle to the crowd after the incident. &#8220;Dry your tears. Clean your mind of anger. We have just witnessed the problems we have in this world.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>As Boles was placed in an <org>Elkin Police</org> cruiser and driven away. the crowd chanted support for the <org>Elkin Police Department</org>, Caudle thanked the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.elkin\">Elkin</location> cops, <org>Elkin Fire Department</org> and Surry Sheriff&#8217;s Department.</p>\n\n<p><org>Elkin Police Department</org> was assisted by <org>Elkin Fire Department</org>, the Surry County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, the <org>Jonesville Police Department</org> and <org>Surry County Emergency Services</org>.</p>",
