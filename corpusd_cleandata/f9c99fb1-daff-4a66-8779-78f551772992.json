    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. \\-- A new Richmond restaurant is asking for help. Subconscious\nCafe, located in the Fan, was forced to close days before its planned Grand\nOpening.\n\nWhile the cafe has reopened for carryout, its owners said it may not be open\nfor long.\n\nCo-owner Randyl Walter said the restaurant had its soft opening on March 14.\nBut before the March 17 Grand Opening, the cafe was forced to close due to the\ncoronavirus.\n\nFor a seven-week period, Walter said he paid his staff half-salary and fed\nthem with food that was supposed to be for the restaurant.\n\nShortly after, Walter learned he would not be able to get federal assistance\nsince the restaurant wasn't open prior to January 31.\n\nWalter said they decided to open for carryout, and are doing the best they\ncan. But he estimated they could only survive at the current rate for another\ncouple of weeks.\n\n\"We used our life savings to open this,\" said Walter. \"Literally. Pretty much\nall the money we had. And we're trying to get through it. That's all. We're\ngoing to have to make it.\"\n\nWalter said they even considered closing permanently last week.\n\n\"Last week I said, you know Leslie, we have to close the restaurant\npermanently. It's not working. And she agreed. And then when I came to work to\nbreak the news to everybody, she calls me on the phone. Says, 'Randy, keep the\nrestaurant. Just keep it. Keep going,'\" said Walter. \"So that's what I do.\"\n\nWalter said they started a GoFundMe, and have qualified for the small business\nrelief initiative, where GoFundMe will match $500 to qualifying businesses\nthat raise at least $500 on GoFundMe.\n\nWalter also said Subconscious Cafe is offering free coffee and masks to anyone\nwho stops by right now.\n\nLearn more about the people and places that make Richmond restaurants great.\nListen to \"Eat It, Virginia!\"",

But before the <chron>March 17</chron> Grand Opening, the cafe was forced to close due to the coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>For a seven-week period, Walter said he paid his staff half-salary and fed them with food that was supposed to be for the restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after, Walter learned he would not be able to get federal assistance since the restaurant wasn't open prior to <chron>January 31</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Walter said they decided to open for carryout, and are doing the best they can. But he estimated they could only survive at the current rate for another couple of weeks.</p>\n\n<p>\"We used our life savings to open this,\" said Walter. \"Literally. Pretty much all the money we had. And we're trying to get through it. That's all. We're going to have to make it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Walter said they even considered closing permanently last week.</p>\n\n<p>\"Last week I said, you know Leslie, we have to close the restaurant permanently. It's not working. And she agreed. And then when I came to work to break the news to everybody, she calls me on the phone. Says, 'Randy, keep the restaurant. Just keep it. Keep going,'\" said Walter. \"So that's what I do.\"</p>\n\n<p>Walter said they started a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4098318050\">GoFundMe</org>, and have qualified for the small business relief initiative, where <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4098318050\">GoFundMe</org> will match <money>$500</money> to qualifying businesses that raise at least <money>$500</money> on <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4098318050\">GoFundMe</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Walter also said <org>Subconscious Cafe</org> is offering free coffee and masks to anyone who stops by right now.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the people and places that make <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.rchmnd\">Richmond</location> restaurants great.
