    "text": "The Brookhaven Police Department has added vehicular homicide to its list of\ncharges filed against a drunk driver accused of hitting an elderly woman\nwalking on the sidewalk in a hit-and-run crash after she died at a local\nhospital.\n\nAccording to a news release, May 21 at about 6:03 p.m. in front of 3833\nPeachtree Road, Sima Pevzner, 89, of Brookhaven, was walking properly on the\nsidewalk, northbound along Peachtree, when she was hit by a car leaving the\nAtler at Brookhaven Apartment homes.\n\nFollowing an investigation, officers determined Patricia Warrington Long, 53,\nof Brookhaven, hit Pevzner with her car, a 2012 Toyota Camry.\n\n\"Ms. Long failed to maintain lane and drove onto the sidewalk, striking Ms.\nPevzner,\" the release stated. \"The crash caused serious injuries to Ms.\nPevzner, and she was transported to an area hospital. After the crash, Ms.\nLong failed to stop at the scene of the crash, failed to render aid, failed to\ncontact emergency medical services or law enforcement, and instead fled from\nthe scene.\"\n\nPevzner died at the hospital May 31 due to the injuries sustained in the\ncrash, the police said in a June 2 news release. Witnesses to the wreck\nremained at the scene and provided the police with a description of Long and\nher vehicle. Shortly after that she was located and arrested by officers.\n\nLong was taken the DeKalb County Sheriff's Office Jail. Following Pevzner's\ndeath, Long was also charged with homicide by vehicle in the first degree, a\nfelony, on top of the four felonies and three misdemeanors she was already\ncharged with.\n\nThe crash remains under investigation, and anyone who witnessed it is asked to\ncall the police's traffic safety unit at 404-637-0748.",
