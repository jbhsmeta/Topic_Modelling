    "text": "THE HOPE OF GLORY\n\nHow wonderfully blessed we are to have one of Americas preeminent, popular\nhistorians share with us his faith and interpretation of the words Jesus spoke\nfrom the cross. Jon Meacham is a former member of the vestries of St. Thomas\nChurch Fifth Avenue and Trinity Church Wall Street in New York City. In this\nage of grand celebrity confession of personal problems, Meacham admits to\nbeing a sinner but does not dwell on that.\n\nInstead, he focuses on the redemption we are all promised given the events\nthat unfolded on Good Friday and on Easter Sunday. Using his historians eye\nand writers gift of verve, in 128 pages Meacham plumbs the depths of Scripture\nfrom the Old and New Testaments to explain how the seven last words of Christ\nare the centerpiece of what it means to be a serious and committed Christian.\n\nWe live in a time marked by hate, division, polarization, and tribalism. The\nwords of Jesus are the antithesis of this paradigm. Love, forgiveness,\ncompassion, and gentleness should be the guiding principles for genuine\nbelievers.\n\nWhat makes this book so singular and different from the other books published\nby Meacham is the intimacy and personal feeling he imparts to readers. This is\nmore than just mere preaching to the choir. Rather, Meachams humility, grace,\ngravitas, and stature in American culture take a back seat to his admission of\nfaith. Risky? Maybe. But arent all Christians called to take the ultimate risk\nas Jesus did and put their total trust in the divine power of a compassionate\nGod?\n\nEach of the seven words, or phrases, spoken from the cross by Christ are\ndissected by the author within the context of the old order, particularly in\nthe Psalms, and of the new order in the Pauline letters. Each examination\nprovides an in-depth analysis of the particular word, the meaning that Jesus\nwanted to convey, and how his words had been presaged and then used to build\nthe new Christian faith.\n\nAlong the way, readers come to understand just how the Man-God revolutionized\nhumanity and created a way of life that calls us to subscribe to what Abraham\nLincoln would intone centuries later, the better angels of our nature.\n\nReviewed by James A. Percoco, a nationally recognized history educator with\nover 35 years of teaching experience.\n\n\"The work of discerning-or depending on your point of view, assigning-meaning\nto Good Friday and to the story of the empty tomb is a historical as well as a\ntheological process, as was the construction of the faith that has shaped, and\nis shaping, the lives of billions of believers.\"",

In this age of grand celebrity confession of personal problems, Meacham admits to being a sinner but does not dwell on that.</p>\n<p>Instead, he focuses on the redemption we are all promised given the events that unfolded on <chron>Good Friday</chron> and on Easter Sunday. Using his historians eye and writers gift of verve, in 128 pages Meacham plumbs the depths of Scripture from the Old and New Testaments to explain how the seven last words of Christ are the centerpiece of what it means to be a serious and committed Christian.</p>\n<p>We live in a time marked by hate, division, polarization, and tribalism. The words of Jesus are the antithesis of this paradigm. Love, forgiveness, compassion, and gentleness should be the guiding principles for genuine believers.</p>\n<p>What makes this book so singular and different from the other books published by Meacham is the intimacy and personal feeling he imparts to readers. This is more than just mere preaching to the choir. Rather, Meachams humility, grace, gravitas, and stature in American culture take a back seat to his admission of faith. Risky? Maybe. But arent all Christians called to take the ultimate risk as Jesus did and put their total trust in the divine power of a compassionate God?</p>\n<p>Each of the seven words, or phrases, spoken from the cross by Christ are dissected by the author within the context of the old order, particularly in the Psalms, and of the new order in the Pauline letters. Each examination provides an in-depth analysis of the particular word, the meaning that Jesus wanted to convey, and how his words had been presaged and then used to build the new Christian faith.</p>\n<p>Along the way, readers come to understand just how the Man-God revolutionized humanity and created a way of life that calls us to subscribe to what <person>Abraham Lincoln</person> would intone centuries later, the better angels of our nature.</p>\n<p>Reviewed by <person>James A. Percoco</person>, a nationally recognized history educator with over 35 years of teaching experience.</p>\n\n<object class=\"mstar_text_entity\"><param name=\"mstar_entity_type\" value=\"Sidebar\" /><param name=\"mstar_entity_inline\" value=\"Y\" /><div class=\"Sidebar_content\">\n<p>\"The work of discerning-or depending on your point of view, assigning-meaning to <chron>Good Friday</chron> and to the story of the empty tomb is a historical as well as a theological process, as was the construction of the faith that has shaped, and is shaping, the lives of billions of believers.\"</p>\n</div></object>",
