    "text": "Editor's note: Dr. Phillips High School has 13 valedictorians. We have\nfeatured passages from a few of their speeches here. The rest of the speeches\ncan be found on [OrangeObserver.com](http://OrangeObserver.com).\n\nFELIX AGUILAR LUGO Today, the world is giving us great lessons about life and\nhumanity, but don't be afraid! Everything we learn from these experiences will\nserve us to continue this journey that has just begun. At the end, we will be\nproud to say: It has been long but worthwhile doing it. Classmates and\nfriends: We have made it.\n\nNANCY ALAYOUBI\n\nIt went by as fast as our family always said it would. This chapter that we\nwill never go back to. But at least the memories will live with us. Every\nmovie, every book, and every song has to end. High school is no different.\nBut, this is a new beginning for all of us. Today, we say thank you to our\nfamilies; today, we say goodbye to our teachers; and today, we say hello to\nthe rest of our lives.\n\nSOPHIA CASTELLANOS This is a time to be grateful for the good times and\nexcited for the next big steps in our life. The world is changing, and it is\nour time to step up to the plate. We are the future, and I'm so excited to see\nwhat we do with it. Follow your dreams, and you'll never know what you can\nachieve. STEPHANIE CERVINO These past four years have finally led up this day,\nand we should feel very proud of ourselves for this achievement. However, we\nshould remember that this is only the beginning. Our diplomas open a\nremarkable range of opportunities just waiting for us to encounter them.\n\nAARSH CHOKSHI\n\nI've noticed that people sometimes define us based on the memories they have\nof us. Some of us are defined by others as nerds, some as athletes and a\nselect few of us are deemed winners. The truth is, other people's labels don't\nmatter unless we believe them. Ultimately, we are the ones who define\nourselves as winners, losers, good, bad, nerds or athletes. Class of 2020, we\nhave the opportunity to define ourselves in the coming years. So, define\nyourself as whoever you want to be; define yourself as the best version of you\nbecause your perception of yourself is a thousand times more important and\nmeaningful than anyone else's version of you.\n\nLUCIA GAYNOR\n\nSocial distancing. Quarantine. Six Feet Apart. Pandemic. These are pretty\nstrange terms. It's honestly the stuff of movies. However, it's our grim\nreality right now. Dr. Phillips High School has proved itself to be an\nunexpected safe haven from the harsh realities. Events such as the spirit\nweeks, dances such as homecoming and prom, Black History Month, the showcases,\namong others have provided each student fun memories on campus and most\nimportantly, together. We realize now that normalcy is a fragile illusion, but\nour memories are strong enough to help us through difficult times and help us\nmove forward into our futures.\n\nSYDNEY KAUFMAN\n\nAfter 13 years of school, most of us are ready for today. Ready to take with\nus the good memories and leave the bad ones behind. But rearview mirrors exist\nfor a reason. Without looking back, it's not safe to say where we can go in\nour futures. So while it may seem a tall order, I ask that you not only\nremember the spirit weeks, the school dances and the senior skip days.\nRemember also the anxiety over where to sit, the nerves before your first\nvarsity game, and the racing hearts as you open your exam booklet. Remember\nhow you've grown, alongside friends and teachers, and despite our current\ndifficult distance.\n\nMICHELLE MCGRATH Each and every one of you have made significant\naccomplishments and contributions at Dr. Phillips High School, engraving your\nown paw print into the halls of the school. But, now, it is time to make the\ndaring leap into your future. The future is intimidating. But it is also\ncalling your name.\n\nKAITLYN MONTAGUE We as a class are still navigating through an uncertain time\nthat no other graduating class has ever had to face. Yet through adversity we\ncan still find opportunity.\n\nOpportunity to get out of our comfort zone.\n\nOpportunity to learn more about ourselves.\n\nOpportunity to help others. And finally, opportunity to re-imagine our future.\n\nWe must embrace these opportunities and remain determined to overcome this\ntogether.\n\nRAFAEL MORENO SALVATIERRA\n\nThe events we are living today are just little examples of what is going to\nhappen to each one of us in the future. Life always takes dramatic turns, and\nmost of the time, they are not in our favor. However, the situation itself is\nnot as important as one might think; what we do with it is what really\nmatters.\n\nSARINA ZHOU\n\nWhat can you accomplish in four years? That was the question that all of us,\nas the Class of 2020, faced as we gingerly stepped into the waters of the vast\nsea of experiences that high school would offer. For some of us, we felt\naccomplishment as we finally mastered a new skill or instrument or became\nleaders in what we loved doing. For many of us, we felt achievement as we\nsmiled from ear to ear with friends. But, I know that for all of us, we feel a\nsense of pride and wonder for how much we've grown over the past four years.",

    "html": "<p>Editor's note: <org>Dr. Phillips High School</org> has 13 valedictorians. We have featured passages from a few of their speeches here. The rest of the speeches can be found on <a href=\"http://OrangeObserver.com\">OrangeObserver.com</a>.</p>\n<p>FELIX AGUILAR <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/es.lu\">LUGO</location> Today, the world is giving us great lessons about life and humanity, but don't be afraid! Everything we learn from these experiences will serve us to continue this journey that has just begun. At the end, we will be proud to say: It has been long but worthwhile doing it. Classmates and friends: We have made it.</p>\n\n<p><person>NANCY ALAYOUBI</person></p>\n\n<p>It went by as fast as our family always said it would. This chapter that we will never go back to. But at least the memories will live with us. Every movie, every book, and every song has to end. High school is no different. But, this is a new beginning for all of us. Today, we say thank you to our families; today, we say goodbye to our teachers; and today, we say hello to the rest of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>SOPHIA CASTELLANOS This is a time to be grateful for the good times and excited for the next big steps in our life. The world is changing, and it is our time to step up to the plate. We are the future, and I'm so excited to see what we do with it. Follow your dreams, and you'll never know what you can achieve. STEPHANIE CERVINO These past four years have finally led up this day, and we should feel very proud of ourselves for this achievement. However, we should remember that this is only the beginning. Our diplomas open a remarkable range of opportunities just waiting for us to encounter them.</p>\n\n<p>AARSH CHOKSHI</p>\n\n<p>I've noticed that people sometimes define us based on the memories they have of us. Some of us are defined by others as nerds, some as athletes and a select few of us are deemed winners. The truth is, other people's labels don't matter unless we believe them. Ultimately, we are the ones who define ourselves as winners, losers, good, bad, nerds or athletes. Class of 2020, we have the opportunity to define ourselves in the coming years. So, define yourself as whoever you want to be; define yourself as the best version of you because your perception of yourself is a thousand times more important and meaningful than anyone else's version of you.</p>\n\n<p><person>LUCIA GAYNOR</person></p>\n\n<p>Social distancing. Quarantine. Six Feet Apart. Pandemic. These are pretty strange terms. It's honestly the stuff of movies. However, it's our grim reality right now. <org>Dr. Phillips High School</org> has proved itself to be an unexpected safe haven from the harsh realities. Events such as the spirit weeks, dances such as homecoming and prom, Black History Month, the showcases, among others have provided each student fun memories on campus and most importantly, together. We realize now that normalcy is a fragile illusion, but our memories are strong enough to help us through difficult times and help us move forward into our futures.</p>\n\n<p><person>SYDNEY KAUFMAN</person></p>\n\n<p>After 13 years of school, most of us are ready for today. Ready to take with us the good memories and leave the bad ones behind. But rearview mirrors exist for a reason. Without looking back, it's not safe to say where we can go in our futures. So while it may seem a tall order, I ask that you not only remember the spirit weeks, the school dances and the senior skip days. Remember also the anxiety over where to sit, the nerves before your first varsity game, and the racing hearts as you open your exam booklet. Remember how you've grown, alongside friends and teachers, and despite our current difficult distance.</p>\n\n<p>MICHELLE MCGRATH Each and every one of you have made significant accomplishments and contributions at <org>Dr. Phillips High School</org>, engraving your own paw print into the halls of the school. But, now, it is time to make the daring leap into your future. The future is intimidating. But it is also calling your name.</p>\n\n<p>KAITLYN MONTAGUE We as a class are still navigating through an uncertain time that no other graduating class has ever had to face. Yet through adversity we can still find opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Opportunity to get out of our comfort zone.</p>\n\n<p>Opportunity to learn more about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Opportunity to help others. And finally, opportunity to re-imagine our future.</p>\n\n<p>We must embrace these opportunities and remain determined to overcome this together.</p>\n\n<p><person>RAFAEL MORENO SALVATIERRA</person></p>\n\n<p>The events we are living today are just little examples of what is going to happen to each one of us in the future. Life always takes dramatic turns, and most of the time, they are not in our favor. However, the situation itself is not as important as one might think; what we do with it is what really matters.</p>\n\n<p><person>SARINA ZHOU</person></p>\n\n<p>What can you accomplish in four years? That was the question that all of us, as the Class of 2020, faced as we gingerly stepped into the waters of the vast sea of experiences that high school would offer. For some of us, we felt accomplishment as we finally mastered a new skill or instrument or became leaders in what we loved doing. For many of us, we felt achievement as we smiled from ear to ear with friends. But, I know that for all of us, we feel a sense of pride and wonder for how much we've grown over the past four years.</p>",
