    "text": "4-H Agent\n\nEven though school is out for the summer, it's important that children\ncontinue to learn and grow during their time away from school. This summer,\nRowan County 4-H is still offering 4-H Summer Fun workshops and classes, but\ndue to COVID-19 restrictions, they will look a little different. Any youths\nages 5-18 (as of Jan. 1) are invited to participate in these activities,\nregardless if they are currently in 4-H or not. We will be covering lots of\ntopics, including agriculture, sewing, crafts, outdoor exploration, STEM and\nmuch more.\n\nBecause of COVID-19, more collaboration has happened among 4-H agents across\nNorth Carolina to make 4-H Summer Fun as hands-on, interactive and fun as\npossible, even though we cannot meet in person. There are tons of cross-county\n4-H Summer Fun opportunities available; these programs will also allow youth\nto interact with other 4-H youth from across our state.\n\nRowan County 4-H has also planned programs just for Rowan County youths. We\ncurrently have three hands-on kits available that youth can be registered to\nreceive. These kits are free and include a majority of the materials needed to\ncomplete the tasks. Pre-registration is required and is open until June 30.\nOnce registration has been completed, parents will be contacted and will\nreceive a scheduled pick up time to come by the Extension office to receive\nthe kits.\n\nSew Much Fun: This kit, open to youths ages 9-18 (as of Jan. 1), will allow\nyouths to learn how to hand stitch four different stitches and learn how to\nsew on a button. Families will need access to an iron and ironing board; all\nother materials provided. Pre-recorded demonstration videos will be provided\nto assist youth in this activity. Free. Twenty kits available.\n\nLet's Get Crafty: This kit is designed for youths ages 5-8 (as of Jan. 1).\nThis kit will provide supplies and instructions for five different crafts.\nThese crafts can be done at home at your own pace. Items required by the\nparticipant include: scissors, glue, hot glue, tape, pen/pencil, markers\n(washable and permanent). Free. Twenty kits available.\n\nUp, Up & Away: This kit, available to youths ages 7-13 (as of Jan. 1),\nprovides supplies and instructions for four different airplane and rocket\nactivities. Items required by the participant include: scissors; tape;\npen/pencil; crayons, markers or colored pencils; tape measure (optional).\nFree. Twenty kits available.\n\nThere are also non-kit, virtual Summer Fun opportunities available to Rowan\nCounty youth and one is coming up very soon.\n\nVirtual Poultry Camp: This free, virtual camp will be held online on Zoom from\n10-11 a.m. on June 8-12 daily and will be taught by the Rowan County\nCooperative Extension 4-H agent and livestock agent. Youths will learn about\npoultry terminology & purposes, breed origins, egg color, breeds, types of\noperations, exterior parts of the bird, and the digestive system. Youths will\ndissect an egg, candle eggs, enjoy a virtual tour of a poultry farm and more.\nEach day will consist of a lesson, activity, and short, easy homework task.\nLimit to 20. Registration due by June 1.\n\nTo register for these programs, visit <https://rowan.ces.ncsu.edu/rowan-\ncounty-4-h-summer-fun/>. All registration links are provided. Check back to\nthis site often for updates as Rowan County 4-H will continue to plan and\ncreate additional 4-H Summer Fun programs for July and August. This website\nalso includes registration links to additional virtual 4-H programs from\nacross the state that Rowan County youths are eligible to attend.\n\nI want to highlight a few of the 4-H Summer Fun opportunities offered to\nyouths all across the state. Even though these are not being orchestrated by\nRowan County 4-H, do not neglect them. They will be amazing opportunities for\nyour children.\n\n* Since overnight camps are closed, N.C. 4-H is offering a virtual camping experience on June 22-26. Families have an a la carte menu of organized camp activities to choose from. Register soon, as it's filling up fast. <https://nc4h.ces.ncsu.edu/camps-centers/>\n\n* North Carolina 4-H is offering lots of free programs, with registration opening on June 1. For details, check out: <https://nc4h.ces.ncsu.edu/4-h-curriculum-at-a-glance/nc-4-h-virtual-summer-programs/>.\n\n* 4-H Agents across the South Central 4-H District (a 19-county area that includes Rowan) are planning district 4-H SPIN Clubs. These special interest clubs will meet several times throughout the summer and focus on various topics. They will include learning, at-home challenges, and more! Details listed here: <https://rowan.ces.ncsu.edu/rowan-county-4-h-summer-fun/>\n\nWe will miss our in-person interactions this summer, but we are excited about\nthe opportunity to continue educating youth by providing at-home and virtual\nopportunities. If you have questions about any of the summer opportunities\navailable, please contact [laura_allen@ncsu.edu](mailto:laura_allen@ncsu.edu)\nor 704-216-8970.

    "html": "<p>4-<person>H Agent</person></p>\n<p>Even though school is out for the summer, it's important that children continue to learn and grow during their time away from school. This summer, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> 4-H is still offering 4-<person>H Summer Fun</person> workshops and classes, but due to COVID-19 restrictions, they will look a little different. Any youths ages 5-18 (as of <chron>Jan. 1</chron>) are invited to participate in these activities, regardless if they are currently in <org>4-H</org> or not. We will be covering lots of topics, including agriculture, sewing, crafts, outdoor exploration, STEM and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Because of COVID-19, more collaboration has happened among <org>4-H</org> agents across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location> to make 4-<person>H Summer Fun</person> as hands-on, interactive and fun as possible, even though we cannot meet in person. There are tons of cross-county 4-<person>H Summer Fun</person> opportunities available; these programs will also allow youth to interact with other <org>4-H</org> youth from across our state.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> 4-H has also planned programs just for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> youths. We currently have three hands-on kits available that youth can be registered to receive. These kits are free and include a majority of the materials needed to complete the tasks. Pre-registration is required and is open until <chron>June 30</chron>. Once registration has been completed, parents will be contacted and will receive a scheduled pick up time to come by the Extension office to receive the kits.</p>\n\n<p><person>Sew Much Fun</person>: This kit, open to youths ages 9-18 (as of <chron>Jan. 1</chron>), will allow youths to learn how to hand stitch four different stitches and learn how to sew on a button. Families will need access to an iron and ironing board; all other materials provided. Pre-recorded demonstration videos will be provided to assist youth in this activity. Free. Twenty kits available.</p>\n\n<p>Let's Get Crafty: This kit is designed for youths ages 5-8 (as of <chron>Jan. 1</chron>). This kit will provide supplies and instructions for five different crafts. These crafts can be done at home at your own pace. Items required by the participant include: scissors, glue, hot glue, tape, pen/pencil, markers (washable and permanent). Free. Twenty kits available.</p>\n\n<p>Up, Up &amp; Away: This kit, available to youths ages 7-13 (as of <chron>Jan. 1</chron>), provides supplies and instructions for four different airplane and rocket activities. Items required by the participant include: scissors; tape; pen/pencil; crayons, markers or colored pencils; tape measure (optional). Free. Twenty kits available.</p>\n\n<p>There are also non-kit, virtual <person>Summer Fun</person> opportunities available to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> youth and one is coming up very soon.</p>\n\n<p>Virtual Poultry Camp: This free, virtual camp will be held online on Zoom from <chron>10-11 a.m.</chron> on <chron>June 8-12</chron> daily and will be taught by the <org>Rowan County Cooperative Extension</org> 4-H agent and livestock agent. Youths will learn about poultry terminology &amp; purposes, breed origins, egg color, breeds, types of operations, exterior parts of the bird, and the digestive system. Youths will dissect an egg, candle eggs, enjoy a virtual tour of a poultry farm and more. Each day will consist of a lesson, activity, and short, easy homework task. Limit to 20. Registration due by <chron>June 1</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>To register for these programs, visit <a href=\"https://rowan.ces.ncsu.edu/rowan-county-4-h-summer-fun/\">https://rowan.ces.ncsu.edu/rowan-county-4-h-summer-fun/</a>.

Check back to this site often for updates as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> 4-H will continue to plan and create additional 4-<person>H Summer Fun</person> programs for July and August. This website also includes registration links to additional virtual <org>4-H</org> programs from across the state that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> youths are eligible to attend.</p>\n\n<p>I want to highlight a few of the 4-<person>H Summer Fun</person> opportunities offered to youths all across the state. Even though these are not being orchestrated by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.rowan\">Rowan County</location> 4-H, do not neglect them. They will be amazing opportunities for your children.</p>\n\n<p>*  Since overnight camps are closed, N.C. <org>4-H</org> is offering a virtual camping experience on <chron>June 22-26</chron>. Families have an a la carte menu of organized camp activities to choose from. Register soon, as it's filling up fast. <a href=\"https://nc4h.ces.ncsu.edu/camps-centers/\">https://nc4h.ces.ncsu.edu/camps-centers/</a></p>\n\n<p>*  <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nc\">North Carolina</location> 4-H is offering lots of free programs, with registration opening on <chron>June 1</chron>.
