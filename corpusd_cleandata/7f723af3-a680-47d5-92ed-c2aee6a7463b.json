Now, as Web User reaches its landmark 500th issue, we're in the midst of a nationwide lockdown, which has somewhat muted our celebration - leaving us not so much blowing our own trumpet as sounding a resigned parp!</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we decided to mark our big 500 with a special cover feature about one of the things we do best: rounding up great software you can download for free. We're helping you, our loyal readers, save money on full, premium, paid-for programs with a value of more than &#163;500 (that's a 'monkey' in Cockney slang). Some of the offers are time-limited, so grab them before they go.</p>\n<p>I'd like to thank everyone who has bought, subscribed to and read Web User over the past 500 issues - we couldn't have made it this far without you! We'd love to hear your memories of the magazine.</p>\n<p><person>Robert Irvine</person>, Editor</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:editor@webuser.co.uk\">editor@webuser.co.uk</a></p>\n<p>#webuser</p>",
