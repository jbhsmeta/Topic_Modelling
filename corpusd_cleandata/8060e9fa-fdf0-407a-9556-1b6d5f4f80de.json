    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information\nTechnology Business Daily \\-- International Business Machines Corporation\n(Armonk, New York, United States) has been issued patent number 10,665,715,\naccording to news reporting originating out of Alexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx\neditors.\n\nThe patent's inventors are Joseph, Praveen (Albany, NY); Seshadri, Indira\n(Niskayuna, NY); De Silva, Ekmini A. (Slingerlands, NY); Sieg, Stuart A.\n(Albany, NY).\n\nThis patent was filed on August 28, 2018 and was published online on June 8,\n2020.\n\nFrom the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents\nobtained the following quote: \"The present invention relates in general to\nfabrication methods and resulting structures for semiconductor devices. More\nspecifically, the present invention relates to fabrication methods and\nresulting structures for forming gate structures of vertical transistors.\n\n\"Semiconductor devices are typically formed using active regions of a wafer.\nIn an integrated circuit (IC) having a plurality of metal oxide semiconductor\nfield effect transistors (MOSFETs), each MOSFET has a source and a drain that\nare formed in an active region of a semiconductor layer by implanting n-type\nor p-type impurities in the layer of semiconductor material. A conventional\ngeometry for MOSFETs is known as a planar device geometry in which the various\nparts of the MOSFET device are laid down as planes or layers.\n\n\"One type of MOSFET is a non-planar FET known generally as a vertical FET\n(VFET). VFETs employ semiconductor fins and surround-gates that can be\ncontacted outside the active region, resulting in increased device density and\nincreased performance over lateral devices. In VFETs, the source to drain\ncurrent flows in a direction that is perpendicular to a major surface of the\nsubstrate. For example, in a known VFET configuration a major substrate\nsurface is horizontal and a vertical fin extends upward from the substrate\nsurface. The fin forms the channel region of the transistor. A source region\nand a drain region are situated in electrical contact with the top and bottom\nends of the channel region, while a gate is disposed on one or more of the fin\nsidewalls.\"\n\nSupplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also\nobtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"Embodiments of\nthe invention are directed to a method of fabricating a semiconductor device.\nThe method comprises forming a fin hardmask on an upper surface of a\nsemiconductor substrate, and forming a semiconductor fin below the fin hard\nmask on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate. The method further\ncomprises selectively depositing at least one dielectric material on the fin\nhardmask such that at least one extension portion extends below the upper fin\nsurface to define the length of a channel region of the semiconductor fin that\nextends between the at least one dielectric material and the semiconductor\nsubstrate. The method further comprises forming a gate structure on the\nchannel region.\n\n\"Embodiment of the invention are also direct to a method of controlling a gate\nlength of a vertical field effect transistor (VFET). The method comprises\nforming a plurality of semiconductor fins on a semiconductor substrate. Each\nsemiconductor fin includes a lower portion on an upper surface of the\nsemiconductor substrate. The method further comprises forming a bottom\nsource/drain region on the semiconductor substrate. The bottom source/drain\nregion contacts the lower portion of the semiconductor fins. The method\nfurther comprises forming a bottom spacer on an upper surface of the bottom\nsource/drain region, and selectively depositing at least one dielectric\nmaterial on each fin hardmask. The method further comprises forming a gate\nstructure on the exposed channel region to define a gate length of the gate\nstructure.\n\n\"Embodiments of the invention are further directed to a semiconductor device\nthat includes a semiconductor fin extending from a first source/drain to an\nopposing second source/drain. The semiconductor fin includes a channel region\nbetween the first and second source/drains. The semiconductor device further\nincludes a spacer having an upper surface having the second source/drain\nformed thereon, and a gate structure a gate structure wrapping around the\nchannel region.

(<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.slinds\">Slingerlands, NY</location>); Sieg, Stuart A. (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.albany\">Albany, NY</location>).</p>\n<p>This patent was filed on <chron>August 28, 2018</chron> and was published online on <chron>June 8, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>From the background information supplied by the inventors, news correspondents obtained the following quote: &#8220;The present invention relates in general to fabrication methods and resulting structures for semiconductor devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to fabrication methods and resulting structures for forming gate structures of vertical transistors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Semiconductor devices are typically formed using active regions of a wafer. In an integrated circuit (IC) having a plurality of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), each MOSFET has a source and a drain that are formed in an active region of a semiconductor layer by implanting n-type or p-type impurities in the layer of semiconductor material. A conventional geometry for MOSFETs is known as a planar device geometry in which the various parts of the MOSFET device are laid down as planes or layers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One type of MOSFET is a non-planar FET known generally as a vertical FET (VFET). VFETs employ semiconductor fins and surround-gates that can be contacted outside the active region, resulting in increased device density and increased performance over lateral devices. In VFETs, the source to drain current flows in a direction that is perpendicular to a major surface of the substrate. For example, in a known VFET configuration a major substrate surface is horizontal and a vertical fin extends upward from the substrate surface. The fin forms the channel region of the transistor. A source region and a drain region are situated in electrical contact with the top and bottom ends of the channel region, while a gate is disposed on one or more of the fin sidewalls.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Supplementing the background information on this patent, NewsRx reporters also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;Embodiments of the invention are directed to a method of fabricating a semiconductor device. The method comprises forming a fin hardmask on an upper surface of a semiconductor substrate, and forming a semiconductor fin below the fin hard mask on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate. The method further comprises selectively depositing at least one dielectric material on the fin hardmask such that at least one extension portion extends below the upper fin surface to define the length of a channel region of the semiconductor fin that extends between the at least one dielectric material and the semiconductor substrate. The method further comprises forming a gate structure on the channel region.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Embodiment of the invention are also direct to a method of controlling a gate length of a vertical field effect transistor (VFET). The method comprises forming a plurality of semiconductor fins on a semiconductor substrate. Each semiconductor fin includes a lower portion on an upper surface of the semiconductor substrate. The method further comprises forming a bottom source/drain region on the semiconductor substrate. The bottom source/drain region contacts the lower portion of the semiconductor fins. The method further comprises forming a bottom spacer on an upper surface of the bottom source/drain region, and selectively depositing at least one dielectric material on each fin hardmask. The method further comprises forming a gate structure on the exposed channel region to define a gate length of the gate structure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Embodiments of the invention are further directed to a semiconductor device that includes a semiconductor fin extending from a first source/drain to an opposing second source/drain. The semiconductor fin includes a channel region between the first and second source/drains. The semiconductor device further includes a spacer having an upper surface having the second source/drain formed thereon, and a gate structure a gate structure wrapping around the channel region.
