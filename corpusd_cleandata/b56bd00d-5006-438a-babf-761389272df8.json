    "text": "SOUTH HAVEN \\- Ron Wise has been putting out fires, responding to ambulance\ncalls and leading one of Van Buren County's largest fire departments for most\nof his adult life. But after 31 years of being part of South Haven Area\nEmergency Services, Wise will be putting away his gear in exchange for\nretirement.\n\nEarlier this week in a changing-of-the-guard ceremony of sorts, Wise welcomed\nBrandon Hinz as the new fire chief and director of SHAES. Hinz has been with\nSHAES since 1999, starting as a paid on-call responder. He became a full-time\nfirefighter in 2005 and later served as an interim captain. He will now\noversee 16 full-time employees in addition to 30 paid-on-call firefighters, a\ncommunication staff and seasonal beach safety interns, while Wise will serve\nin an advisory role until his retirement officially begins at the end of\nSeptember. Then, he and his wife, Kim, plan to take a vacation.\n\n\"I'm going to Hawaii with my wife to celebrate our 24-year marriage\nanniversary and my retirement,\" Wise said.\n\nWise comes from a long line of firefighters and first responders.\n\n\"My grandfather was fire chief for Niles Township and my father was a\nfirefighter for Niles Township, along with my twin brother, who is a fire\ncaptain with Niles city and older brother a police officer in Indiana,\" Wise\nsaid.\n\nWise first began his career with SHAES as a firefighter 31 years ago when the\ndepartment was much smaller, and simply known as the South Haven Fire\nDepartment. He moved up the ranks to become captain, and 12 years ago was\nchosen to lead the department, which by then had become known as SHAES \u0096 an\nentity funded by and serving the city and townships of South Haven, Geneva and\nCasco.\n\nThe department operates out of three stations, utilizing nearly 20 different\ntypes of rolling stock, ranging from ambulances to a fire boat to a 93-foot\nladder tower. In 2019 the department responded to more than 2,000 calls for\nassistance.\n\nSHAES has come to be looked upon as a model for other communities to follow.\n\n\"I have traveled throughout the state of Michigan talking to other communities\nexplaining how SHAES is funded and how costs are shared,\" Wise said. \"The\nbiggest hurdle that I see for those communities is trusting one another and\nthe willingness to work together. I am very proud to tell other communities\nhow great our communities work together on so many levels.\"\n\nWhen Wise isn't wearing his administrative hat for SHAES, he can often be\nfound working alongside firefighters and paramedics during emergency\nsituations.\n\n\"He gets involved in actual fire-fighting when appropriate,\" said Tom Renner,\na former longtime on-call firefighter who now serves as the publicist for\nSHAES. \"He has retained his certifications to be able to be part of the\nmedical response team when needed. He'll even drive a fire truck to a scene if\nthe situation warrants.\"\n\nThis past summer, Wise was credited with playing a key role in saving the life\nof an exhausted swimmer who had become caught in high waves in Lake Michigan.\nWise jumped into the water with a rope and wrapped it around the man, who then\nwas pulled to safety by two other firefighters who were on the South Pier.\n\n\"Doing the job to the best of my ability has always been the goal,\" said Wise\nin response to why he thinks it's important to stay directly involved with his\nstaff. \"Both of my parents stressed the importance of serving our communities\nand helping others. ... My mother taught 4- H, Sunday school, Cub Scouts and\nwas Berrien County Youth Fair volunteer for many years. My father taught\nlifeguarding, firefighter training and still is active on the Niles Township\nfire department at the age of 84. He is still a volunteer at Berrien County\nYouth Fair each year, along with myself and twin brother.\"\n\nFirefighting has changed quite a bit over the past three decades, according to\nWise.\n\n\"The amount of training hours that is needed to get the initial training to\nbecome a firefighter or EMT has increased greatly,\" he said. \"Our fires burn\nso much hotter and faster in homes today as compared to older days.\"\n\nSome aspects of the job haven't changed much, such as dealing with tragic\nsituations.\n\n\"Any call that deals with children is the hardest to deal with,\" he said.\n\nBut helping people is what keeps firefighters and paramedics motivated.\n\n\"The ability to help someone in their deepest of times is very rewarding,\" he\nsaid.",

    "title": "Changing of the guard at SH-area fire department",
    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.souven\">SOUTH HAVEN</location> - <person>Ron Wise</person> has been putting out fires, responding to ambulance calls and leading one of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.vanren\">Van Buren County's</location> largest fire departments for most of his adult life. But after 31 years of being part of <org>South Haven Area Emergency Services</org>, Wise will be putting away his gear in exchange for retirement.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week in a changing-of-the-guard ceremony of sorts, Wise welcomed <person>Brandon Hinz</person> as the new fire chief and director of SHAES. Hinz has been with SHAES since 1999, starting as a paid on-call responder. He became a full-time firefighter in 2005 and later served as an interim captain. He will now oversee 16 full-time employees in addition to 30 paid-on-call firefighters, a communication staff and seasonal beach safety interns, while Wise will serve in an advisory role until his retirement officially begins at the end of September. Then, he and his wife, Kim, plan to take a vacation.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm going to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.hi\">Hawaii</location> with my wife to celebrate our 24-year marriage anniversary and my retirement,\" Wise said.</p>\n\n<p>Wise comes from a long line of firefighters and first responders.</p>\n\n<p>\"My grandfather was fire chief for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.niles\">Niles Township</location> and my father was a firefighter for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.niles\">Niles Township</location>, along with my twin brother, who is a fire captain with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.niles\">Niles</location> city and older brother a police officer in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.in\">Indiana</location>,\" Wise said.</p>\n\n<p>Wise first began his career with SHAES as a firefighter 31 years ago when the department was much smaller, and simply known as the <org>South Haven Fire Department</org>. He moved up the ranks to become captain, and 12 years ago was chosen to lead the department, which by then had become known as SHAES &#150; an entity funded by and serving the city and townships of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.souven\">South Haven</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.in.geneva\">Geneva</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.casco\">Casco</location>.</p>\n\n<p>The department operates out of three stations, utilizing nearly 20 different types of rolling stock, ranging from ambulances to a fire boat to a 93-foot ladder tower. In 2019 the department responded to more than 2,000 calls for assistance.</p>\n\n<p>SHAES has come to be looked upon as a model for other communities to follow.</p>\n\n<p>\"I have traveled throughout the state of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location> talking to other communities explaining how SHAES is funded and how costs are shared,\" Wise said. \"The biggest hurdle that I see for those communities is trusting one another and the willingness to work together. I am very proud to tell other communities how great our communities work together on so many levels.\"</p>\n\n<p>When Wise isn't wearing his administrative hat for SHAES, he can often be found working alongside firefighters and paramedics during emergency situations.</p>\n\n<p>\"He gets involved in actual fire-fighting when appropriate,\" said <person>Tom Renner</person>, a former longtime on-call firefighter who now serves as the publicist for SHAES. \"He has retained his certifications to be able to be part of the medical response team when needed. He'll even drive a fire truck to a scene if the situation warrants.\"</p>\n\n<p>This past summer, Wise was credited with playing a key role in saving the life of an exhausted swimmer who had become caught in high waves in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">Lake Michigan</location>. Wise jumped into the water with a rope and wrapped it around the man, who then was pulled to safety by two other firefighters who were on the <location>South Pier</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Doing the job to the best of my ability has always been the goal,\" said Wise in response to why he thinks it's important to stay directly involved with his staff. \"Both of my parents stressed the importance of serving our communities and helping others. ... My mother taught <org>4- H</org>, Sunday school, Cub Scouts and was Berrien County Youth Fair volunteer for many years. My father taught lifeguarding, firefighter training and still is active on the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.nilhip\">Niles Township</location> fire department at the age of 84. He is still a volunteer at Berrien County Youth Fair each year, along with myself and twin brother.\"</p>\n\n<p>Firefighting has changed quite a bit over the past three decades, according to Wise.</p>\n\n<p>\"The amount of training hours that is needed to get the initial training to become a firefighter or EMT has increased greatly,\" he said. \"Our fires burn so much hotter and faster in homes today as compared to older days.\"</p>\n\n<p>Some aspects of the job haven't changed much, such as dealing with tragic situations.</p>\n\n<p>\"Any call that deals with children is the hardest to deal with,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>But helping people is what keeps firefighters and paramedics motivated.</p>\n\n<p>\"The ability to help someone in their deepest of times is very rewarding,\" he said.</p>",
