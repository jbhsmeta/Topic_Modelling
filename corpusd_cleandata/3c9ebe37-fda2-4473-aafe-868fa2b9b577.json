    "text": "Three of Texas' top Republican leaders are vigorously fighting efforts to\nexpand mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing it will lead to\nincreased voter fraud, yet all three have themselves cast absentee ballots at\nleast once in past elections.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick \\- then a state senator - voted by mail in 2007 for a May\nHouston municipal election and an ensuing runoff, though Harris County records\nshow his first mail-in ballot was rejected because of a signature verification\nissue. Patrick is a regular voter in both local and state elections and favors\ncasting his ballot during the early voting period. He's been voting in\nMontgomery County since 2017.\n\nAlthough he's a regular in-person voter in Collin County, Texas Attorney\nGeneral Ken Paxton used the voting-by-mail option to cast a ballot in a 2011\nmunicipal election, according to county records. In recent elections, he's\nopted for voting early.\n\nTravis County election records show Gov. Greg Abbott cast a mail-in ballot in\na 1997 special election when he was a justice on the Texas Supreme Court.\nAbbott consistently votes in local and state elections.\n\nPaxton's office has been locked in legal fights on multiple fronts in state\nand federal courts to block an expansion of voting by mail during the\ncoronavirus pandemic, and thus far his office has successfully convinced\nappellate courts to close the legal door on allowing more voters to qualify\nfor mail-in ballots.\n\nPatrick recently referred to those expansion efforts as a \"scam by Democrats\nto steal the election,\" saying there was no reason anyone under 65 should be\n\"able to say I am afraid to go vote\" during the pandemic. Texas allows all\nvoters who are 65 and older to qualify for ballots they can fill out at home\nand mail in. (Patrick was not 65 when he voted by mail.)\n\nThose younger than 65 can vote by mail only if they meet a narrow set of\nrestrictions: if they'll be out of the county during the voting period, if\nthey're confined in jail but otherwise eligible, or if they have an illness or\ndisability.\n\n\"Lt. Governor Patrick has repeatedly said that those who are eligible under\nTexas law to vote by mail should continue to do so - including those over 65,\nthe disabled and anyone not in the county or city during the election,\" Sherry\nSylvester, a spokesperson for Patrick, said in a statement. \"What he opposes\nis expanding vote by mail to everyone on the premise that the fear of\ncontracting coronavirus is a disability.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Abbott and Paxton did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDemocrats, civic organizations and multiple voters have filed several lawsuits\nagainst the state, saying it's dangerous to require people to wait in lines\nand cast ballots on machines shared with other voters while the virus remains\nin circulation. Their arguments have focused not on the fear of contracting\nthe virus, but whether a lack of immunity qualifies as a disability under the\nstate's election code. GOP state officials have opposed the effort, arguing in\npart that mail-in voting should remain limited because it is vulnerable to\nfraud.\n\nThere are documented cases of fraud in mail-in voting in Texas. But like voter\nfraud overall, it remains rare.\n\nStill, the Texas Legislature has taken action to address weaknesses in the\nsystem in the recent past. State lawmakers passed a measure in 2017 to widen\nthe definition of mail-in ballot fraud, boost penalties for certain offenses\nand strengthen rules for signature verification on mail-in ballots. The\nlegislation, which Abbott signed into law, also requires local election\nofficials to notify voters when their ballots are rejected and limits who can\nassist voters using the vote-by-mail option.",

    "html": "<p>Three of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas'</location> top Republican leaders are vigorously fighting efforts to expand mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing it will lead to increased voter fraud, yet all three have themselves cast absentee ballots at least once in past elections.</p>\n<p>Lt. Gov. <person>Dan Patrick</person> - then a state senator - voted by mail in 2007 for a <person>May Houston</person> municipal election and an ensuing runoff, though <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.harris\">Harris County</location> records show his first mail-in ballot was rejected because of a signature verification issue. Patrick is a regular voter in both local and state elections and favors casting his ballot during the early voting period. He's been voting in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.monery\">Montgomery County</location> since 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Although he's a regular in-person voter in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.collin\">Collin County, Texas</location> Attorney General <person>Ken Paxton</person> used the voting-by-mail option to cast a ballot in a 2011 municipal election, according to county records. In recent elections, he's opted for voting early.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.travis\">Travis County</location> election records show Gov. <person>Greg Abbott</person> cast a mail-in ballot in a 1997 special election when he was a justice on the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0580537411\">Texas Supreme Court</org>. Abbott consistently votes in local and state elections.</p>\n\n<p>Paxton's office has been locked in legal fights on multiple fronts in state and federal courts to block an expansion of voting by mail during the coronavirus pandemic, and thus far his office has successfully convinced appellate courts to close the legal door on allowing more voters to qualify for mail-in ballots.</p>\n\n<p>Patrick recently referred to those expansion efforts as a \"scam by <org>Democrats</org> to steal the election,\" saying there was no reason anyone under 65 should be \"able to say I am afraid to go vote\" during the pandemic. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> allows all voters who are 65 and older to qualify for ballots they can fill out at home and mail in. (Patrick was not 65 when he voted by mail.)</p>\n\n<p>Those younger than 65 can vote by mail only if they meet a narrow set of restrictions: if they'll be out of the county during the voting period, if they're confined in jail but otherwise eligible, or if they have an illness or disability.</p>\n\n<p>\"Lt. <person>Governor Patrick</person> has repeatedly said that those who are eligible under <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> law to vote by mail should continue to do so - including those over 65, the disabled and anyone not in the county or city during the election,\" <person>Sherry Sylvester</person>, a spokesperson for Patrick, said in a statement. \"What he opposes is expanding vote by mail to everyone on the premise that the fear of contracting coronavirus is a disability.\"</p>\n\n<p>Representatives for Abbott and Paxton did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p><org>Democrats</org>, civic organizations and multiple voters have filed several lawsuits against the state, saying it's dangerous to require people to wait in lines and cast ballots on machines shared with other voters while the virus remains in circulation. Their arguments have focused not on the fear of contracting the virus, but whether a lack of immunity qualifies as a disability under the state's election code. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3974939109\">GOP</org> state officials have opposed the effort, arguing in part that mail-in voting should remain limited because it is vulnerable to fraud.</p>\n\n<p>There are documented cases of fraud in mail-in voting in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>. But like voter fraud overall, it remains rare.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the <org>Texas Legislature</org> has taken action to address weaknesses in the system in the recent past. State lawmakers passed a measure in 2017 to widen the definition of mail-in ballot fraud, boost penalties for certain offenses and strengthen rules for signature verification on mail-in ballots. The legislation, which Abbott signed into law, also requires local election officials to notify voters when their ballots are rejected and limits who can assist voters using the vote-by-mail option.</p>",
