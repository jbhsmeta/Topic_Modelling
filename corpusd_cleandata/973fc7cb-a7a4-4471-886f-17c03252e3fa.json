    "text": "Hundreds of people protesting the police treatment of Black people spilled\nonto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia on Monday afternoon\njust before a curfew took effect, leading law enforcement to fire nonlethal\nbullets and tear gas and halting traffic during the evening rush hour.\n\nThe crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin\nBridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs. Some\nclimbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted.\n\nMore than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to\nblock the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand thoroughfare leading from\ndowntown to the city's imposing art museum.\n\nThe confrontation came after the National Guard stationed vehicles outside\nCity Hall and other downtown buildings, officials curtailed public transit,\nand city leaders put a curfew in effect for a third day Monday after a weekend\nof destruction that led to over 400 arrests.\n\nA few hundred protesters were forced down Benjamin Franklin Parkway toward\nCity Hall after the interstate demonstration. Many went to the Police\nDepartment headquarters known as the Round House on Arch Street, where a line\nof National Guard members and police officers stood watch on the stairs.\n\nShortly before 7 p.m., a little more than half decided to take a knee as a\nsign to protesters. Many cheered and video taped the officers on one knee at\nthe top of the stairs. Afterward, many of the protesters left, but others\nunsure of what to do, slowly milled about outside the station.\n\nThe Monday curfew was 6 p.m., the same as the day before and two hours earlier\nthan Saturday. The city closed most services and business in the Center City,\nincluding a noon shutdown of all downtown bus, trolley and subway stops.\n\nProtesters - like others across the country, inspired by the death last week\nof George Floyd, a black man who was pinned by a Minneapolis officer who put\nhis knee on the handcuffed man's neck - chanted \"Let him go\" after an arrest\nthat was captured in videos posted online as relations between a crowd and\npolice near Philadelphia's convention center grew tense.\n\nOn a call with governors Monday before the confrontation on the interstate,\nPresident Donald Trump singled out Philadelphia, where as of Monday morning\ndestruction had been on par with that in some other major cities.\n\n\"Philadelphia is a mess. Philadelphia, what happened there is horrible. And\nthat was on television. They're breaking into stores and nobody showed up to\neven stop them,\" Trump said.\n\nMayor Jim Kenney responded, saying Trump has not been helpful during the\nprotests. Kenney also said he wasn't prepared to speculate on whether the\nprotests and their aftermath would change the city's plan to ease restrictions\non businesses and other stay-at-home-orders by entering into the state's\n\"yellow phase\" of coronavirus recovery Friday.\n\n\"I'm not saying no, but I'm not saying yes either,\" Kenney said.\n\nAbout 50 National Guard members arrived in the city early Monday, and about 50\nmore were expected soon, U.S. Attorney William McSwain said.\n\nProtests also erupted across the state, including in Lancaster, Erie, Reading,\nChambersburg and Bethlehem.\n\nLancaster officials said Monday that they had evidence white nationalists had\ninstigated the violence at a weekend rally there that had a few instances of\nbottles of cayenne pepper and other projectiles thrown at police.\n\nMcSwain's office is investigating whether any crimes would fall under his\nfederal jurisdiction, he and U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, said at a\nnews conference.\n\n\"We are looking into who are the real agitators,\" McSwain said.\n\nPolice in Erie charged eight people after attacks on police and attempts to\nset fires at three downtown businesses Saturday.\n\nThe Erie Times-News reported that assaults or attempted assaults on police\ninvolved bricks, frozen water bottles, fireworks and a Molotov cocktail.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a fire late Sunday that appeared to have started at a Rent-A-\nCenter in the Kensington neighborhood caused parts of several stores and\napartment buildings to collapse, Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said.\n\nNearly two dozen police officers were injured over two nights, including one\nwho was hit by a fleeing vehicle and is hospitalized with broken ribs and a\nbroken arm, said John McNesby, president of a Philadelphia police union.\n\nPolice Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said police made 429 arrests from Saturday\nto early Monday, a number expected to grow. The city normally gets about 3,000\ncalls for police service, Kenney said, but got about 18,000 on Sunday.\n\n\"We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,\" Outlaw\nsaid.",

    "html": "<p>Hundreds of people protesting the police treatment of Black people spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> on Monday afternoon just before a curfew took effect, leading law enforcement to fire nonlethal bullets and tear gas and halting traffic during the evening rush hour.</p>\n<p>The crowds on <location>Interstate 676</location> also led to the closure of the <location>Benjamin Franklin Bridge</location>, the main link from downtown <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> suburbs. Some climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted.</p>\n\n<p>More than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to block the <location>Benjamin Franklin Parkway</location>, a grand thoroughfare leading from downtown to the city's imposing art museum.</p>\n\n<p>The confrontation came after the <org>National Guard</org> stationed vehicles outside <location>City Hall</location> and other downtown buildings, officials curtailed public transit, and city leaders put a curfew in effect for a third day Monday after a weekend of destruction that led to over 400 arrests.</p>\n\n<p>A few hundred protesters were forced down <location>Benjamin Franklin Parkway</location> toward <location>City Hall</location> after the interstate demonstration. Many went to the <org>Police Department</org> headquarters known as the Round House on <location>Arch Street</location>, where a line of <org>National Guard</org> members and police officers stood watch on the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly before <chron>7 p.m.</chron>, a little more than half decided to take a knee as a sign to protesters. Many cheered and video taped the officers on one knee at the top of the stairs. Afterward, many of the protesters left, but others unsure of what to do, slowly milled about outside the station.</p>\n\n<p>The Monday curfew was <chron>6 p.m.</chron>, the same as the day before and two hours earlier than Saturday. The city closed most services and business in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.cenity\">Center City</location>, including a noon shutdown of all downtown bus, trolley and subway stops.</p>\n\n<p>Protesters - like others across the country, inspired by the death last week of <person>George Floyd</person>, a black man who was pinned by a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck - chanted \"Let him go\" after an arrest that was captured in videos posted online as relations between a crowd and police near <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia's</location> convention center grew tense.</p>\n\n<p>On a call with governors Monday before the confrontation on the interstate, President <person>Donald Trump</person> singled out <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>, where as of Monday morning destruction had been on par with that in some other major cities.</p>\n\n<p>\"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> is a mess. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>, what happened there is horrible. And that was on television. They're breaking into stores and nobody showed up to even stop them,\" Trump said.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor <person>Jim Kenney</person> responded, saying Trump has not been helpful during the protests. Kenney also said he wasn't prepared to speculate on whether the protests and their aftermath would change the city's plan to ease restrictions on businesses and other stay-at-home-orders by entering into the state's \"yellow phase\" of coronavirus recovery Friday.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm not saying no, but I'm not saying yes either,\" Kenney said.</p>\n\n<p>About 50 <org>National Guard</org> members arrived in the city early Monday, and about 50 more were expected soon, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Attorney <person>William McSwain</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>Protests also erupted across the state, including in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lancas\">Lancaster</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.erie\">Erie</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.readin\">Reading</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.chaurg\">Chambersburg</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.bethem\">Bethlehem</location>.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.lancas\">Lancaster</location> officials said Monday that they had evidence white nationalists had instigated the violence at a weekend rally there that had a few instances of bottles of cayenne pepper and other projectiles thrown at police.</p>\n\n<p>McSwain's office is investigating whether any crimes would fall under his federal jurisdiction, he and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Sen. <person>Pat Toomey</person>, a Republican, said at a news conference.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are looking into who are the real agitators,\" McSwain said.</p>\n\n<p>Police in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.erie\">Erie</location> charged eight people after attacks on police and attempts to set fires at three downtown businesses Saturday.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Erie Times-News</org> reported that assaults or attempted assaults on police involved bricks, frozen water bottles, fireworks and a Molotov cocktail.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>, a fire late Sunday that appeared to have started at a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:RCII\">Rent-A-Center</org> in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.kenton\">Kensington</location> neighborhood caused parts of several stores and apartment buildings to collapse, Fire Commissioner <person>Adam Thiel</person> said.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly two dozen police officers were injured over two nights, including one who was hit by a fleeing vehicle and is hospitalized with broken ribs and a broken arm, said <person>John McNesby</person>, president of a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> police union.</p>\n\n<p>Police Commissioner <person>Danielle Outlaw</person> said police made 429 arrests from Saturday to early Monday, a number expected to grow. The city normally gets about 3,000 calls for police service, Kenney said, but got about 18,000 on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,\" Outlaw said.</p>",
