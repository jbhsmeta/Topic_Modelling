    "text": "AdvertisementJerusalem PostWORLD NEWSScientists find link between COVID-19\nseverity and geneticsPatients with blood type A were linked to a 50% increase\nin the likelihood in needing to get oxygen or go on a ventilatorByJERUSALEM\nPOST STAFFJUNE 5, 2020 07:17The secret to healing what ails you lies within\nyour own DNA(photo credit: DREAMSTIME)Genetic variations may be what causes\ndifferent people to suffer from different symptoms of the coronavirus,\naccording to a new study by European scientists,The New York TimesThe study,\nwhich has not been peer-reviewed yet, is the first to find a strong\nstatistical link between genetic variations and COVID-19, the illness caused\nby theVariations at two spots in the human genome are associated with an\nincreased risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, according to the\nstudy. Patients with Type A blood were linked to a 50% increase in the\nlikelihood in needing to get oxygen or go on a ventilator, reported theOddly\nenough, variations in ACE2, the protein to which the virus attaches itself on\nthe surface of human cells, did not seem to make a difference in the severity\nof the virus.\"There are new kids on the block now,\" said Andre Franke, a\nmolecular geneticist at the University of Kiel in Germany and a co-author of\nthe new study, according to theWhile age and preexisting conditions have\nalready been found to increase the risk of severe cases of COVID-19,\ngeneticists are hoping that DNA tests could help identify at-risk patients as\nwell.The study was conducted by taking blood samples from 1,610 patients who\nneeded an oxygen supply or were put on a ventilator and 2,205 blood donors\nwith no evidence of COVID-19. DNA was extracted from the samples and scanned\nwith genotyping.The scientists found two spots in the genome, known as loci,\nshared by an unusually high number of severely ill patients compared with\nthose who were not ill, including one locus which determines our blood\ntype.Chinese scientists also found that patients with blood type A were more\nlikely to develop a severe case of COVID-19, according to theWhile the Chinese\nstudy does support the new study, questions remain on why blood type affects\nthe severity of the illness. \"That is haunting me, quite honestly,\" said\nFranke.The locus where the blood-type gene is located also contains DNA that\nacts an on-off switch for a gene producing a protein that triggers strong\nimmune responses.The novel coronavirus triggers an overreaction of the immune\nsystem in some people, leading to inflammation and lung damage. It could be\nthat genetic variations influence that response.The second locus found in the\nstudy, on Chromosome 3, has an even stronger statistical link to COVID-19, but\nthe spot houses six genes so it's still unclear which one influences the\nseverity of the illness, according to theOne of the six genes encodes a\nprotein known to interact with ACE2, but another nearby gene encodes a potent\nimmune-signaling molecule. It could be that this gene triggers an overreaction\nas well.A thousand researchers in 46 countries, including the European\nscientists involved in the new study, are collecting DNA samples from people\nwith COVID-19 and sharing the data on the website of the COVID-19 Host\nGenetics Initiative.Andrea Ganna, a genetic epidemiologist at the University\nof Helsinki, said that the collected data of the initiative were beginning to\npoint to a single spot on Chromosome 3 as a potentially important factor,\naccording to theTimes.Jonathan Sebat, a geneticist at the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego, told the\"We were all hoping optimistically this was one\nof those situations,\" said Sebat, who is running a study in California to see\nif the two loci are as important as they seem.Sebat stressed that the study\nfocused on patients with respiratory issues.Scientists conducting further\nstudies may be able to zero in on exactly which gene in each locus affects the\ndisease and may likely find many other genes with subtler influences on the\ncourse of the illness.The variation in severity between patients has been\nattributed to other factors, including different strains of the virus, as\nwell.Over 30Li 's team infected cells with COVID-19 strains carrying different\nmutations, of which the most aggressive strains were found to generate as much\nas 270 times as much viral load as the weakest strains. The aggressive strains\nalso killed the human cells the fastest.The results indicated \"that the true\ndiversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated,\" Li\nwrote.\"Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of\nthese accumulating mutations into account to avoid potential pitfalls,\" the\nscientists said.Alex Winston contributed to this report.TagsCoronavirusvar\ncont = 'Help Provide Emergency ReliefProvide elderly widows and Holocaust\nsurvivors with food during the coronavirus pandemicLearn More >Subscribe for\nour daily newsletterBy subscribing I accept theterms of useHot OpinionTrump's\npeace plan offers Israel an opportunity not to be missedJPOST EDITORIALA\nwindow of opportunityYAAKOV KATZThe government's response to coronavirus is a\nnational embarrassmentEHUD OLMERTMy Word: Return to sender - Advice from a\nyounger selfLIAT COLLINSRight from Wrong: Ellen DeGeneres, George Floyd and\nIyad al-HalakRUTHIE BLUMMost ReadIran, Russia, China, Turkey celebrate\n'collapse' of USTrump signs the Never Again Education Act into lawDNA analysis\nof Dead Sea Scrolls unveils their once secret originWhite supremacists, Soros,\n'Russians,' and Antifa blamed for US protestsKosher stores, synagogues,\nvandalized and looted in LA protests",

Patients with Type A blood were linked to a 50% increase in the likelihood in needing to get oxygen or go on a ventilator, reported theOddly enough, variations in ACE2, the protein to which the virus attaches itself on the surface of human cells, did not seem to make a difference in the severity of the virus.\"There are new kids on the block now,&#8221; said <person>Andre Franke</person>, a molecular geneticist at the <org>University of Kiel</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location> and a co-author of the new study, according to theWhile age and preexisting conditions have already been found to increase the risk of severe cases of COVID-19, geneticists are hoping that DNA tests could help identify at-risk patients as well.The study was conducted by taking blood samples from 1,610 patients who needed an oxygen supply or were put on a ventilator and 2,205 blood donors with no evidence of COVID-19. DNA was extracted from the samples and scanned with genotyping.The scientists found two spots in the genome, known as loci, shared by an unusually high number of severely ill patients compared with those who were not ill, including one locus which determines our blood type.Chinese scientists also found that patients with blood type A were more likely to develop a severe case of COVID-19, according to theWhile the Chinese study does support the new study, questions remain on why blood type affects the severity of the illness. \"That is haunting me, quite honestly,\" said Franke.The locus where the blood-type gene is located also contains DNA that acts an on-off switch for a gene producing a protein that triggers strong immune responses.The novel coronavirus triggers an overreaction of the immune system in some people, leading to inflammation and lung damage. It could be that genetic variations influence that response.The second locus found in the study, on Chromosome 3, has an even stronger statistical link to COVID-19, but the spot houses six genes so it's still unclear which one influences the severity of the illness, according to theOne of the six genes encodes a protein known to interact with ACE2, but another nearby gene encodes a potent immune-signaling molecule. It could be that this gene triggers an overreaction as well.A thousand researchers in 46 countries, including the European scientists involved in the new study, are collecting DNA samples from people with COVID-19 and sharing the data on the website of the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative.<person>Andrea Ganna</person>, a genetic epidemiologist at the <org>University of Helsinki</org>, said that the collected data of the initiative were beginning to point to a single spot on Chromosome 3 as a potentially important factor, according to theTimes.Jonathan Sebat, a geneticist at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3804785564\">University of California, San Diego</org>, told the&#8220;We were all hoping optimistically this was one of those situations,&#8221; said Sebat, who is running a study in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> to see if the two loci are as important as they seem.Sebat stressed that the study focused on patients with respiratory issues.Scientists conducting further studies may be able to zero in on exactly which gene in each locus affects the disease and may likely find many other genes with subtler influences on the course of the illness.The variation in severity between patients has been attributed to other factors, including different strains of the virus, as well.Over 30Li 's team infected cells with COVID-19 strains carrying different mutations, of which the most aggressive strains were found to generate as much as 270 times as much viral load as the weakest strains. The aggressive strains also killed the human cells the fastest.The results indicated \"that the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated,&#8221; Li wrote.&#8220;Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations into account to avoid potential pitfalls,&#8221; the scientists said.<person>Alex Winston</person> contributed to this report.TagsCoronavirusvar cont = 'Help Provide Emergency ReliefProvide elderly widows and Holocaust survivors with food during the coronavirus pandemicLearn More &gt;Subscribe for our daily newsletterBy subscribing I accept theterms of useHot OpinionTrump's peace plan offers <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/il\">Israel</location> an opportunity not to be missedJPOST EDITORIALA window of opportunityYAAKOV KATZThe government's response to coronavirus is a national embarrassmentEHUD OLMERTMy Word: Return to sender - Advice from a younger selfLIAT COLLINSRight from Wrong: <person>Ellen DeGeneres</person>, <person>George Floyd</person> and Iyad al-HalakRUTHIE BLUMMost ReadIran, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tr\">Turkey</location> celebrate 'collapse' of USTrump signs the Never Again Education Act into lawDNA analysis of Dead Sea Scrolls unveils their once secret originWhite supremacists, Soros, 'Russians,' and Antifa blamed for US protestsKosher stores, synagogues, vandalized and looted in LA protests</p>",
