    "text": "By CHINO S. LEYCO\n\nFormer Secretaries of finance and socioeconomic planning along with government\nbankers, eminent economists and industrialists are seeking the immediate\ncongressional passage of the repacked second tax reform bill.\n\nIn a joint statement released by the Department of Finance (DOF), its 17\nsignatories threw their support behind the Corporate Recovery and Tax\nIncentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act now pending in the Senate.\n\nAccording to the DOF, among the \"initial\" signatories include former Bangko\nSentral ng Pilipinas Governor (BSP) Amando Tetangco Jr., former Finance\nSecretaries Roberto de Ocampo, Margarito Teves, Jose Camacho and Jose Pardo\nand former Prime Minister Cesar Virata.\n\n\"The signatories expressed their full 'support for the immediate passage of\nthe CREATE Act, formerly known as the Corporate Income Tax and Incentives\nRationalization Act (CITIRA), as a much-needed boost to the recovery of the\nPhilippine economy,\" the DOF said.\n\nThe bill is \"a necessary policy tool for retaining and creating jobs that will\nhelp our people secure their livelihoods against the adverse impacts of\nCOVID-19,\" it added.\n\nOther signatories include BSP Monetary Board Member and former Socioeconomic\nPlanning Secretary Felipe Medalla as well as former Socioeconomic Planning\nSecretary and Ateneo professor Cielito Habito.\n\nIf passed into law, the CREATE bill will immediate cut by five percentage\npoints the present 30 percent corporate income tax, which they said \"will\nbenefit all businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises.\"\n\nThe bill will also extend the net operating loss carryover (NOLCO) by two\nyears, which the formers officials said will \"provide businesses more\nresources to pay for their expenses and keep their employees\" amid the\ncoronavirus pandemic's economic fallout.\n\nBSP Monetary Board Member Bruce Tolentino, former DOF Undersecretary and\nFoundation for Economic Freedom Vice Chairman Romeo Bernardo, former UP Los\nBanos Vice Chancellor and current Asian Development Bank Institute Board\nMember Fermin Adriano also supported the CREATE bill.\n\nOther signatories are Dean Joel Tan-Torres, tax and incentives policy experts\nprofessor emeritus Epictetus Patalinghug of the UP Virata School of Business\nand professor Renato Reside of UP School of Economics.\n\nUPSE Alumni Association President Jeffrey Ng, former Philippine Institute of\nDevelopment Studies President Gilberto Llanto, and Action for Economic Reforms\ncoordinator Filomeno Sta. Ana III also signed the joint statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the group warned of the consequences should the passage of the\nreform is delayed, saying that \"during crisis periods, inaction on crucial\nreforms leads to even greater cost to society.\"\n\nCAPTION(S):",
