    "text": "According to the recent statements from the Society of London Theatre/UK\nTheatre, our sector must lobby government for support through the pandemic\nbecause it is neither practical nor economical to reopen our theatres while\nimposing strict social distancing . ( Our place in the world is at risk. It s\nas grave as that , Julian Bird interview, May 28, p12) I would argue there has\nnever been a worse time for theatre, as an industry, to go dark.\n\nNot only is this a surprisingly myopic key message for a leading industry body\nto take, important mistakes are being made by pushing this one-size-fits-all\nline so vehemently. Whether or not theatre can take place socially distanced\ndepends on the venue and the business model behind the production. The theatre\nI work at (London s Cockpit Theatre) could present a safe, viable production\nof The Vagina Monologues at an affordable price and pay the cast Equity rates\ntomorrow, if we were allowed to.\n\nSuggesting that venues - all venues - can only open once social distancing is\nno longer strict risks painting the industry into a corner. Things don t need\nto get back to normal before returning. No one can say when, if ever, the old\nnormal will return.\n\nThe SOLT/UK Theatre statement is presented as a unified front , but it only\nrepresents the large theatres. Some members are as threatened by staying shut\nas others are by opening. Would it not be better to galvanize our sector s\nability to help each other through, for example, programme sharing and\nconsortium building between large and small venues or generating inter-\nregional links?\n\nViability on a marginal cost/benefit basis per production doesn t factor in\nstrategic business planning or, crucially, start-up costs following closure.\nFor mixed programming venues with multiple income streams (classes, courses,\nbars, studio hires) the situation is entirely different. The costs of ramping\nup complex productivity following closure increase for every month closed. At\nour venue, closing meant taking 30 titles, plus an off-site jazz festival, off\nsale. As an estimate, I d say every month closed lengthens our subsequent\nstart-up time by four months before we reach anything like the same level of\nbusiness we were doing before.\n\nThe situation we find ourselves in is dire. Many will judge it unwise to open\nuntil, hopefully, things brighten up. That s fine. But for others, continued\nclosure means slow death as their constituency and business complexity - not\njust their market - erodes. Open, they can adapt and survive. Closed, they can\ndo nothing, not even help sustain the industry for the closed theatres to\nreturn to.\n\nDave Wybrow\n\nDirector of London s Cockpit Theatre",

    "html": "<p>According to the recent statements from the <org>Society of London Theatre/UK Theatre</org>, our sector must lobby government for support through the pandemic because it is neither practical nor economical to reopen our theatres while imposing strict social distancing . ( Our place in the world is at risk. It s as grave as that , <person>Julian Bird</person> interview, <chron>May 28</chron>, p12) I would argue there has never been a worse time for theatre, as an industry, to go dark.</p>\n<p>Not only is this a surprisingly myopic key message for a leading industry body to take, important mistakes are being made by pushing this one-size-fits-all line so vehemently. Whether or not theatre can take place socially distanced depends on the venue and the business model behind the production. The theatre I work at (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> s <org>Cockpit Theatre</org>) could present a safe, viable production of The Vagina Monologues at an affordable price and pay the cast Equity rates tomorrow, if we were allowed to.</p>\n<p>Suggesting that venues - all venues - can only open once social distancing is no longer strict risks painting the industry into a corner. Things don t need to get back to normal before returning. No one can say when, if ever, the old normal will return.</p>\n<p><org>The SOLT/UK Theatre</org> statement is presented as a unified front , but it only represents the large theatres. Some members are as threatened by staying shut as others are by opening. Would it not be better to galvanize our sector s ability to help each other through, for example, programme sharing and consortium building between large and small venues or generating inter-regional links?</p>\n<p>Viability on a marginal cost/benefit basis per production doesn t factor in strategic business planning or, crucially, start-up costs following closure. For mixed programming venues with multiple income streams (classes, courses, bars, studio hires) the situation is entirely different. The costs of ramping up complex productivity following closure increase for every month closed. At our venue, closing meant taking 30 titles, plus an off-site jazz festival, off sale. As an estimate, I d say every month closed lengthens our subsequent start-up time by four months before we reach anything like the same level of business we were doing before.</p>\n<p>The situation we find ourselves in is dire. Many will judge it unwise to open until, hopefully, things brighten up. That s fine. But for others, continued closure means slow death as their constituency and business complexity - not just their market - erodes. Open, they can adapt and survive. Closed, they can do nothing, not even help sustain the industry for the closed theatres to return to.</p>\n<p><person>Dave Wybrow</person></p>\n<p>Director of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location> s <org>Cockpit Theatre</org></p>",
