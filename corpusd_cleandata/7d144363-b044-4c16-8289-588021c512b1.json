    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy\nand Law Daily \\-- Investigators publish new report on Pediatrics. According to\nnews originating from London, United Kingdom, by NewsRx correspondents,\nresearch stated, \"There have been rising concerns in the UK about the levels\nof serious violence between young people, especially serious physical violence\nand knife crime. Interactions with young people in the emergency department\n(ED) at the time of injury provide an opportunity for screening and\nintervention in order to reduce the risk of repeat attendances.\"\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Imperial College\nLondon, \"However, paediatricians and other healthcare workers can feel unsure\nabout the best way to intervene. Embedding youth workers in EDs has started in\nsome UK hospitals, making use of a potential 'teachable moment' in the\nimmediate aftermath of an event to help change behaviour. Based on a rapid\nreview of the literature, we summarise the evidence for these types of\ninterventions and present two practice examples.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Finally, we discuss\nhow EDs could approach the embedding of youth workers within their department\nand considerations required for this.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Young victims of youth violence:\nusing youth workers in the emergency department to facilitate 'teachable\nmoments' and to improve access to services. _Archives of Disease In Childhood\nEducation and Practice Edition_ , 2020;():edpract-2019-318251.\n\nThe news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained\nfrom E.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Health Policy and Law Daily</org> -- Investigators publish new report on Pediatrics. According to news originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London, United Kingdom</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;There have been rising concerns in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> about the levels of serious violence between young people, especially serious physical violence and knife crime. Interactions with young people in the emergency department (ED) at the time of injury provide an opportunity for screening and intervention in order to reduce the risk of repeat attendances.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1786502929\">Imperial College London</org>, &#8220;However, paediatricians and other healthcare workers can feel unsure about the best way to intervene. Embedding youth workers in EDs has started in some <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> hospitals, making use of a potential &#8216;teachable moment&#8217; in the immediate aftermath of an event to help change behaviour. Based on a rapid review of the literature, we summarise the evidence for these types of interventions and present two practice examples.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Finally, we discuss how EDs could approach the embedding of youth workers within their department and considerations required for this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Young victims of youth violence: using youth workers in the emergency department to facilitate &#8216;teachable moments&#8217; and to improve access to services. <em>Archives of Disease In Childhood Education and Practice Edition</em>, 2020;():edpract-2019-318251.</p>\n<p>The news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained from <person>E.
