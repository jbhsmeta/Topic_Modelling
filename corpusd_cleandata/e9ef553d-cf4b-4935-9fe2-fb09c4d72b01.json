The testing is done from your\nvehicle.\n\nThe testing site in the Metro East is the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Center on\nArgonne Drive in East St. Louis. Hours are 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. This site\ncan also test people with no car.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health recommends people get tested five to\nseven days after participating in a mass gathering, including rallies and\nprotests, or immediately if symptoms develop.\n\n\"As people gather in large crowds with varying degrees of social distancing,\nthere is cause for concern about COVID-19 spread and outbreaks, especially if\nmasks were not worn universally,\" said IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike. \"If\nthere are known cases, we can make sure those people are quarantined and not\nexposing other individuals.\"\n\nA list of all public and private testing sites can be found on the IDPH\nwebsite at [dph.illinois.gov/testing](http://dph.illinois.gov/testing).\n\n___\n\n(c)2020 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",
