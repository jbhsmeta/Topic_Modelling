It will\nfocus on preparing businesses and organization of all sizes and types to\ndetermine their risk of transmission of COVID-19.\n\nLed by Lucia Mullen, an public health analyst at the Johns Hopkins Center for\nHealth Security and a research associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School\nof Public Health, the webinar will introduce participants to a toolkit that\nenables them to identify their business' area of risk, with suggested\nmodifications to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.\n\n\"With this toolkit, employers can work through a four-stage process to not\nonly calculate and understand their risk, but also receive examples of\nmitigation measures to increase the safety of their employees and customers,\"\nsaid Mullen in a press release about the webinar.\n\nThe webinar is free and will be hosted by county Commissioners Marian\nMoskowitz, Josh Maxwell and Michelle Kichline. It is supported by the county's\nnine Chambers of Commerce, and other economic, education and government\nleaders - all members of the Business Task Force.\n\nIn addition to developing and scheduling a series of webinars, the Chester\nCounty COVID-19 Business Task Force, formed earlier this month, is preparing a\nweb-based resource with practical and downloadable information specifically\ndesigned for county businesses and organizations, and for local residents.\n\nUnder the banner of \"Restore Chester County\" the website will help Chester\nCounty businesses, organizations and residents confidently and easily navigate\ntheir way through the re-opening process, providing both overall and industry-\nspecific guidance relating to COVID-19.\n\nTo join the webinar, go to <https://chesco.org/4496/Johns-Hopkins>.",
