    "text": "The Port Arthur Independent School District is moving forward with an all-\nvirtual learning summer school program starting on June 8.\n\nDistrict officials approved the program at this week's virtual board meeting\ndespite the Texas Education Agency's announcement earlier this month that\nclass may resume face-to-face on June 1.\n\nDr. Melvin Getwood, Dr. Kim Vine and Carmen Hudson answered questions on the\ndistrict's decision in unison.\n\n\"In the interest of the safety and well-being of our students and staff\nmembers, Port Arthur ISD chose to hold summer school virtually rather than in-\nperson,\" the trio responded. \"District officials carefully reviewed the\nguidance documents provided by the governor, TEA and the Center for Disease\nControl in order to determine the most effective and safest way to provide\nsummer learning opportunities.\"\n\nPort Arthur ISD will offer summer school, at no cost, to elementary and\nsecondary students required to attend to meet district requirements.\n\nThe Extended School Year Program and Bilingual PreK-Kindergarten Enrichment\nProgram will also be held virtually.\n\nEach Port Arthur ISD campus will host its own virtual summer school program\nfrom June 8 to July 2 Monday-Thursday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nEach school will have a Lead Remote Learning Team with virtual summer school\nteachers available during virtual office hours to provide targeted instruction\nand personalized academic assistance with assignments.\n\nHudson, PAISD's at-risk supervisor said, \"with our training, technical\nassistance, and teamwork, we anticipate significant academic growth.\"\n\nThe academic consultants recommended tips for staying on track during online\ninstruction:\n\n* Check your learning platform each day to learn about the expectations for classwork.\n\n* Follow the Honor Code at all times.\n\n* Follow the norms of communication set by teachers.\n\n* Find a comfortable, distraction-free place in your home to work and study.\n\n* Prepare your work area for live teacher-led instruction in advance.\n\n* Complete all assignments by the due date.\n\n* Put forth your best effort and communicate with teacher when needed.\n\nPort Arthur ISD's decision follows Nederland Independent School District and\nLamar State College Port Arthur's decisions to continue education online for\nsummer courses.\n\nSafety protocols stated for in-person classes include limiting the number of\npeople in classrooms, checking students' body temperature daily, keeping desks\n6 feet apart and limiting the enclosed classrooms to 11, including the\nteacher.\n\nTexas State Teachers Association, or TSTA, shared its opinion on the June 1\nreopening: \"It's too early.\"\n\nTSTA President Noel Candelaria said in press release May 20 that Texas Gov.\nGreg Abbott is creating an illusion that the worst of this health crisis is\nbehind us.\n\n\"It is not,\" he stated. \"People are still getting sick and dying in large\nnumbers and reopening school buildings too soon will increase the peril.\"\n\nThe post Port Arthur ISD outlines virtual summer program dates, school\nconcepts appeared first on Port Arthur News.",
