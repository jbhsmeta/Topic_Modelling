    "text": "The Patriots' practice facility may still be closed to players due to the\ncoronavirus pandemic, but that hasn't stopped two of the team's key playmakers\nfrom getting together to work on their chemistry.\n\nQuarterback Jarrett Stidham and wide receiver Julian Edelman are both in\nMassachusetts and have been \"seeing each other almost every day,\" according to\nESPN's Mike Reiss (on Twitter).\n\nStidham, who looks likely to replace Tom Brady as New England's starting\nquarterback in the fall, broke the news of his workouts with Edelman on\nTwitter. Responding to an Instagram post by former Red Sox (and current\nBrewers) infielder Brock Holt, Stidham hinted at the fact he had been working\nout with Edelman.\n\n\"We've been at it... where you at bro?!!\" Stidham wrote.\n\nThis season will be the first of Edelman's 10-year career in which he will be\nwithout Brady, so it will likely take some time to get used to working with a\nnew quarterback. After a delayed start to the offseason due to strict social\ndistancing guidelines, players -- including Brady and a few of his Buccaneers\nteammates -- are starting to get together for informal workouts.\n\nEdelman has not spoken to reporters since Brady left for the Buccaneers in\nMarch. But other members of the Patriots' organization (including head coach\nBill Belichick and defensive back Devin McCourty) have praised the young\nAuburn product in recent months.\n\n\"(Stidham) worked really hard last year, was our backup quarterback the entire\nseason,\" Belichick said shortly after the draft. \"I know he's working hard in\nthe offseason. He's made a lot of progress in terms of understanding our\noffense and understanding opponent defenses like all players do from year one\nto year two. I'm sure he'll get out there and be ready to go, be prepared,\ncompete hard, and we'll see where it takes us.\"\n\n\"I think he's a young guy who's eager to learn. That quarterback position is\nalways a hard position,\" McCourty said. \"Right away, he worked extremely\nhard.\"\n\n\"I'm excited for that quarterback room. I think they're itching,\" McCourty\nadded. \"You get an opportunity to go out there and compete, that's what we all\nwant. I think for us as players at other positions, we need to focus on what\nwe have to do. Not fall into the trap of the media, like everybody worried\nabout the quarterback room. We just control what we can control and the rest\nwill take care of itself.\"\n\nRelated links:\n\nBill Belichick: Jarrett Stidham has 'made a lot of progress' from year 1 to\nyear 2 with Patriots\n\nJarrett Stidham, Patriots quarterbacks itching to compete, says Devin McCourty\n\nTom Brady's replacement? Patriots QB Jarrett Stidham 'has a lot of great\nqualities,' says Matthew Slater\n\n___\n\n(c)2020 MassLive.com, Springfield, Mass.\n\nVisit MassLive.com, Springfield, Mass. at www.masslive.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "html": "<p>The Patriots&#8217; practice facility may still be closed to players due to the coronavirus pandemic, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped two of the team&#8217;s key playmakers from getting together to work on their chemistry.</p>\n<p>Quarterback <person>Jarrett Stidham</person> and wide receiver <person>Julian Edelman</person> are both in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ma\">Massachusetts</location> and have been &#8220;seeing each other almost every day,\" according to ESPN&#8217;s <person>Mike Reiss</person> (on Twitter).</p>\n<p>Stidham, who looks likely to replace <person>Tom Brady</person> as New England&#8217;s starting quarterback in the fall, broke the news of his workouts with Edelman on Twitter. Responding to an Instagram post by former Red Sox (and current Brewers) infielder <person>Brock Holt</person>, Stidham hinted at the fact he had been working out with Edelman.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been at it... where you at bro?!!\" Stidham wrote.</p>\n<p>This season will be the first of Edelman&#8217;s 10-year career in which he will be without Brady, so it will likely take some time to get used to working with a new quarterback. After a delayed start to the offseason due to strict social distancing guidelines, players -- including Brady and a few of his Buccaneers teammates -- are starting to get together for informal workouts.</p>\n<p>Edelman has not spoken to reporters since Brady left for the Buccaneers in March. But other members of the Patriots&#8217; organization (including head coach <person>Bill Belichick</person> and defensive back <person>Devin McCourty</person>) have praised the young Auburn product in recent months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;(Stidham) worked really hard last year, was our backup quarterback the entire season,\" Belichick said shortly after the draft. \"I know he&#8217;s working hard in the offseason. He&#8217;s made a lot of progress in terms of understanding our offense and understanding opponent defenses like all players do from year one to year two. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll get out there and be ready to go, be prepared, compete hard, and we&#8217;ll see where it takes us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s a young guy who&#8217;s eager to learn. That quarterback position is always a hard position,&#8221; McCourty said. &#8220;Right away, he worked extremely hard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for that quarterback room. I think they&#8217;re itching,\" McCourty added. \"You get an opportunity to go out there and compete, that&#8217;s what we all want. I think for us as players at other positions, we need to focus on what we have to do. Not fall into the trap of the media, like everybody worried about the quarterback room. We just control what we can control and the rest will take care of itself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Related links:</p>\n<p><person>Bill Belichick</person>: <person>Jarrett Stidham</person> has &#8216;made a lot of progress&#8217; from year 1 to year 2 with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131519\">Patriots</org></p>\n<p><person>Jarrett Stidham</person>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131519\">Patriots</org> quarterbacks itching to compete, says <person>Devin McCourty</person></p>\n<p>Tom Brady&#8217;s replacement? <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131519\">Patriots</org> QB <person>Jarrett Stidham</person> &#8216;has a lot of great qualities,' says <person>Matthew Slater</person></p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">___</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">(c)2020 MassLive.com, Springfield, Mass.</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">Visit MassLive.com, Springfield, Mass. at www.masslive.com</p>\n<p class=\"shirttail\">Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>",
