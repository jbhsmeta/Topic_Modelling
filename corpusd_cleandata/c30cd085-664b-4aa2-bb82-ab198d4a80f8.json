    "text": "A NEW state-of-the-art cinema for will no longer be built after the approved\ncouncil application was refused in the Planning and Environment Court.In\nFebruary, Regional Council \u00adapproved the material change of use to allow for a\nnew cinema at Yaralla s Club, which would have included two Gold Room lounges,\nsix standard cinemas, a games room, candy bar and outdoor seating and a water\nfeature.In March, the Place Design Group as agent for the Alceon Group No.56\nPty Ltd ATF Retail Trust, the group that runs Central Centre, lodged a notice\nof \u00adappeal with the Planning and Environment Court in Brisbane against\nRegional Council and Yaralla s Club Incorporated.Represented by Connor O'Meara\nSolicitors, the appeal stated the proposed development was inconsistent with\nthe Planning Scheme for land within the sport and recreation zone and there\nwas insufficient demand to support the existing cinema and the proposed\ndevelopment, so if the development was built there was a \"real prospect\" the\nexisting complex would shut.In the co-respondent's grounds for approval,\nrepresented by McCarthy Durie Lawyers, it was argued the lot in question\nalready had approval for indoor entertainment, food, gaming and licensed\npremises, sports and recreation, short-term accommodation and a \u00adfitness\ncentre so the development of the cinema was logical and complementary to the\n\u00adapproved uses of the land.They also stated if the proposal did not succeed,\nthe current cinema operator had concern about the viability of the current\nlocation as Central had an approximate 40 per cent vacancy rate, was \"poorly\nmaintained\" and was \"no longer an attractive venue\" for the cinema, with no\nability to upgrade the facility.On May 18, Judge Nicole Kefford ordered that\nthe appeal was allowed and the development was refused. Cinemas, Yaralla s\nClub and Central Centre have been contacted for comment.",

Cinemas, Yaralla s Club and  Central  Centre have been contacted for comment.</p>",
