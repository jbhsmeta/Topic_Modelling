    "text": "Lowestoft Railway Station has received a colourful boost with 20 hanging\nbaskets being installed courtesy of volunteers from Lowestoft in Bloom.\n\nThe station baskets contain an array of flowers in shades of blue, purple and\nwhite, complementing two boats converted last year into planters, and other\ndisplays under the care of the volunteer station adopter and Lowestoft Central\nProject team.\n\nThe Wherry Lines Community Rail Partnership has also funded specialist pumping\nequipment to enable the baskets and containers to be watered regularly\nthroughout the summer.\n\nWith restrictions in place due to the continuing Coronavirus crisis, some\nactivities originally planned by Lowestoft in Bloom for 2020 have been\ncurtailed, with their popular annual competition restructured.\n\nJenny Hearth, on behalf of Lowestoft In Bloom, said: \"Lowestoft in Bloom is\nproud to be working with the station again and we continue to work behind the\nscenes to ensure that Lowestoft does indeed bloom again this year.\n\n\"Observing social distancing guidelines, our small team of volunteers set up a\nrota for planting and watering the baskets at the Hollies Nurseries in\nBlundeston, headquarters of our community project.\"\n\n\"Due to restrictions, this year's annual Lowestoft in Bloom competition will\ntake a different format.\n\n\"As many people have sought solace in their gardens, a revised competition has\nbeen devised to reflect this, with full details and application forms now\navailable on our Facebook page.\"\n\nThis year's Lowestoft in Bloom online gardening competition is open to\neveryone in the NR32 and NR33 postcodes and runs until August 31.\n\nChairman of the Wherry Lines Community Rail Partnership, Roger Foulger, added:\n\"We are delighted that Lowestoft In Bloom has been able to support the efforts\nof the Partnership and the Lowestoft Central Project to once again provide\nsome beautiful displays at Lowestoft Railway Station.\n\nAlan Neville, Greater Anglia's Community and Customer Engagement manager,\nsaid: \"We are grateful to Lowestoft In Bloom, the Wherry Lines Community Rail\nPartnership, Jacqui our station adopter and the Lowestoft Central Project for\ntheir continued efforts to enhance Lowestoft Station.\"",
