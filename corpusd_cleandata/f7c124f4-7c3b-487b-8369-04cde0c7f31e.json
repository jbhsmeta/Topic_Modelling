    "text": "\"You mowed the officer down. It was both cowardly and callous,\" Judge Leanne\nClare told the Brisbane District Court on Friday while sentencing Townshend to\na decade behind bars.\"The car was your weapon.\"\"You deliberately forced the\nvehicle onto flesh and bone.\"Judge Clare said it was a serious and violent\nassault on an officer who was acting within the law to protect the\ncommunity.\"It was kind of offence that has the potential to deter good men and\nwomen from the service,\" she said.\"It also has the potential to encourage\neither inaction or heavy-handedness and the abuse of power with terrible\nconsequences.\"Recent overseas events are a tragic reminder of the importance\nof well-trained officers who act with restraint and integrity.\"Senior\nConstable Izzard had been attempting to hail down Townshend in the north\nBrisbane suburb of Chermside in September 2018 when he was struck.Instead of\nstopping, Townshend accelerated and ploughed into the officer.The impact threw\nSenior Constable Izzard onto the bonnet, shattering the windscreen. He was\nthen flung onto the roof of the car as Townshend sped from the scene.The car\ntravelled 30 metres before Townshend deliberately swerved, throwing Senior\nConstable Izzard onto the road.A dash-cam video from a police vehicle showed\nhim lying motionless after the incident.\"The impact broke Officer Izzard's\nprotective gear and his gun. It also shattered his body,\" Judge Clare\nsaid.\"You left Senior Constable Izzard broken and bleeding on the\nfootpath.\"Doctors fought to save his life but they were not hopeful.They told\nthe father-of-two's family and colleagues to prepare for his death.\"I will\nnever forget the sight of all the blood and the intermittent yelling and\nhorrified screaming coming from Aaron as we treated him,\" a fellow police\nofficer, who asked not to be named, told the court in a victim impact\nstatement.Townshend fled the scene and was later found hiding in his father's\nbackyard shed.\"You gave a fanciful story,\" Judge Clare said.\"Any remorse\nexpressed was belated and not very convincing.\"He later pleaded guilty to a\nmalicious act with intent.Townshend was also convicted of unlawfully using a\nmotor vehicle and driving under the influence of methylamphetamine.Senior\nConstable Izzard made a \"miracle\" recovery following brain surgery but he\ncontinues to suffer from numerous life-changing injuries, including relearning\nhow to walk and talk.The officer sobbed as Judge Clare told the court he was\nalso no longer able to remember the birth of his children.Townshend will have\nto serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence before being eligible for\nparole.AAPMost Viewed in Loading",

    "html": "<p>\"You mowed the officer down. It was both cowardly and callous,\" Judge <person>Leanne Clare</person> told the <org>Brisbane District Court</org> on Friday while sentencing Townshend to a decade behind bars.\"The car was your weapon.\"\"You deliberately forced the vehicle onto flesh and bone.\"<person>Judge Clare</person> said it was a serious and violent assault on an officer who was acting within the law to protect the community.\"It was kind of offence that has the potential to deter good men and women from the service,\" she said.\"It also has the potential to encourage either inaction or heavy-handedness and the abuse of power with terrible consequences.\"Recent overseas events are a tragic reminder of the importance of well-trained officers who act with restraint and integrity.\"Senior <person>Constable Izzard</person> had been attempting to hail down Townshend in the north <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/au..brisbn\">Brisbane</location> suburb of Chermside in <chron>September 2018</chron> when he was struck.Instead of stopping, Townshend accelerated and ploughed into the officer.The impact threw Senior <person>Constable Izzard</person> onto the bonnet, shattering the windscreen. He was then flung onto the roof of the car as Townshend sped from the scene.The car travelled 30 metres before Townshend deliberately swerved, throwing Senior <person>Constable Izzard</person> onto the road.A dash-cam video from a police vehicle showed him lying motionless after the incident.\"The impact broke Officer Izzard's protective gear and his gun. It also shattered his body,\" <person>Judge Clare</person> said.\"You left Senior <person>Constable Izzard</person> broken and bleeding on the footpath.\"Doctors fought to save his life but they were not hopeful.They told the father-of-two's family and colleagues to prepare for his death.\"I will never forget the sight of all the blood and the intermittent yelling and horrified screaming coming from Aaron as we treated him,\" a fellow police officer, who asked not to be named, told the court in a victim impact statement.Townshend fled the scene and was later found hiding in his father's backyard shed.\"You gave a fanciful story,\" <person>Judge Clare</person> said.\"Any remorse expressed was belated and not very convincing.\"He later pleaded guilty to a malicious act with intent.Townshend was also convicted of unlawfully using a motor vehicle and driving under the influence of methylamphetamine.Senior <person>Constable Izzard</person> made a \"miracle\" recovery following brain surgery but he continues to suffer from numerous life-changing injuries, including relearning how to walk and talk.The officer sobbed as <person>Judge Clare</person> told the court he was also no longer able to remember the birth of his children.Townshend will have to serve at least 80 per cent of his sentence before being eligible for parole.AAPMost Viewed in Loading</p>",
