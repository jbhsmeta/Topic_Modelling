June 1 (Interfax) - The Russian Foreign Ministry has denied a claim by\nthe United States Department of State regarding the confiscation in Malta of\nan equivalent of $1.1 billion of \"counterfeit\" Libyan dinars printed by the\nRussian joint stock company Goznak for the eastern Libyan government.\n\n\"The contract to print Libyan dinars was signed in 2015 between Goznak and the\nhead of Libya's Central Bank approved by the Libyan House of Representatives\n(parliament). The Libyan side made the required prepayment. In accordance with\nits contractual obligations, the Russian organization sent the Central Bank in\nTobruk a shipment with the printed Libyan banknotes. We are working on the\npremise that said money is needed to support the stable functioning of the\nentire Libyan economy,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on\nSaturday.\n\nBecause of the current duopoly in Libya, it has two central banks: one is in\nTripoli, the seat of the internationally recognized government of national\naccord led by Fayez al-Sarraj, and the other is in Benghazi, whose governor\nwas appointed by an elected parliament, the House of Representative, and thus\npossesses the necessary international legitimacy, the ministry said.\n\n\"Thus, it is not the Libyan dinars but U.S. claims that are false,\" the\nstatement said.\n\nCorridors of Power\n\nUN panel of experts on Libya found no sanctions breach in shipment of\nbanknotes to the country - Goznak\n\nMOSCOW.

Samples of these banknotes\nwere approved by Libyan Central Bank representatives in an established manner;\ntherefore the application of the term 'false' toward these banknotes is\nunsubstantiated and unlawful,\" Goznak said.\n\n\"As is known, the Central Bank of Libya has two offices, in Tripoli and in\nTobruk. The contract under which the batch of banknotes in question was\nmanufactured, was concluded by Goznak with the Central Bank of Libya office in\nTobruk,\" the company said.\n\n\"The commissioning of banknotes from Goznak was approved by the board of\ndirectors of the Central Bank of Libya as far back as 2015. The right of the\nCentral Bank of Libya in Tobruk to conclude this kind of contract was, in\n2016, reaffirmed by a resolution of the Government of National Accord\n(Tripoli). Despite all the differences between the two sides, this decision\nwas not canceled and is valid to this day. The relevant contract with our\ncompany was signed by a person vested with all necessary powers to that end,\"\nthe company said.\n\n\"In violation of the norms of international law, in September of 2019 the\nMalta Customs Authority detained containers with the banknotes belonging to\nthe Central Bank of Libya. Goznak, along with the customer, have repeatedly\nsought to obtain explanations from Maltese authorities. For several months\nMaltese customs agencies were providing no explanations over the seizure of\nthe banknotes, and only in May 2020 did they react with a statement whose\ncontents substantially misrepresents the actual circumstances surrounding the\nrelationship between Goznak and the Central Bank of Libya.\n\n\"We recommend that all other questions regarding the batch of banknotes in\nquestion should be referred to their issuer, the Central Bank of Libya located\nin Tobruk,\" Goznak said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Russian Foreign Ministry denied a claim by the United\nStates Department of State about the batch of Libyan dinars, printed by Goznak\nfor the eastern Libyan government and seized in Malta, being fake.\n\nCorridors of Power\n\nRussian envoy denies Moscow's involvement in violent protests in U.S.\n\nBRUSSELS.

However, our situation involving Israel\nis different than the U.S. I don't think the leadership of Israel may have any\ninterest to use Shor in some political game in Moldova. Ilan Shor must be\nconvicted and he will serve a sentence, if not in Moldova, then in Israel,\"\nDodon said.\n\n\"Moldova has signed a strategic partnership agreement with the U.S.,\ntherefore, there's a hope that Plahotniuc will be extradited, the Prosecutor\nGeneral's Office makes all possible effort to that end,\" he said.\n\nThe former leader of Moldova's Democratic Party, main Moldovan tycoon\nPlahotniuc, left Moldova in the evening of June 14, 2019, when the Democratic\nParty had become the opposition.

We have spent over two decades picking up crumbs and building this\nprosperous country, and we won't allow anyone to privatize it and to bleed dry\nthe unlucky fellows who have always lived under a whip,\" Lukashenko said.\n\n\"We won't allow Belarus to be divided, as happened in 1939,\" he said.\n\n\"We've built our country for our children.

May 29 (Interfax) - The United States embassy to Russia has said it\nbelieves that medical assistance was provided to Paul Whelan, who has been\ncharged with espionage in Russia, only when his condition became critical.\n\n\"Russian authorities waited until Paul Whelan's condition was life-threatening\nto provide him medical attention. That is unacceptable and dangerous,\" U.S.\nembassy spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter.\n\nThe U.S. repeatedly requested that an English-speaking doctor be allowed to\nsee Whelan, but \"he's been denied necessary medical attention,\" Ross said.\n\nU.S. Ambassador John Sullivan spoke to Whelan on Friday, she said. \"We will be\nmonitoring Paul's progress closely, and we hope he will recover quickly,\" the\nU.S. diplomat said.\n\nWhelan's brother said earlier that Whelan had undergone surgery for a hernia.\nThe surgery was successful, he said.\n\nForeign Military Review\n\nGermany suggests waiting for invitations to G7 summit, believes Russia may\ntake part as guest - govt spokesperson\n\nBERLIN. June 3 (Interfax) - Russia may well take part in a G7 summit in the\nUnited States in 2020 as a guest, but it would be reasonable to wait for an\ninvitation from the U.S. before talking about this, German government\nspokesperson Steffen Seibert said on Wednesday.\n\n\"The decision on when such a summit is to be held rests with the host party.\nConcerning its format, guests have traditionally been invited to G7 summits.\nThis is always a question for the host party. But if we're talking about\nchanging the G7's format, such a decision must be agreed upon by all G7\nmembers unanimously,\" Seibert said in response to a question from Interfax on\nWednesday.\n\nHaving guests at the summit and an expanded format are different things, he\nsaid.\n\nSeibert said this approach to all countries that may potentially be guests at\nthe summit is a matter of principle.\n\n\"The format can be changed only provided that all the G7 countries adhere to\nthe same position. Concerning Russia, there is a 2014 decision, when the G8\nformat existed, and the basis for this decision hasn't changed,\" Seibert said.\n\nThe 2014 decision was based on \"the unlawful annexation of Crimea\" by Russia,\nhe said.\n\n\"The chance to change this state of affairs is in the Russian leadership's\nhands,\" Seibert said. He suggested waiting for any further announcements from\nU.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump earlier described the G7 format as inefficient and announced his\nintention to invite Russia, India, South Korea, and Australia to a summit to\nbe hosted by the U.S. in 2020.\n\n###",
