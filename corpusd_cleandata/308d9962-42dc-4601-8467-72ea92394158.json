    "text": "Q I've been thinking about switching to a binocular bivy system. I know the\nmain benefit to using this type of harness is that it provides better\nprotection for your optics. What are some other benefits? Also, with so many\non the market, which one should I choose? J. Munoz, via e-mail\n\nA The advantages to using a bivy system are many. As you said, it provides\nfull protection for your binoculars against harsh weather, dust, and trail\nbrush.\n\nHowever, a well-designed bivy keeps your optics close to your chest as well,\nso you can hustle and jog without worry of your optics swinging around your\nneck or chest. This also improves stalking and crawling ability--no more\ndragging binoculars into the dirt, rocks, or mud. Glassing in the wind is\nimproved, too. Many elastic chest-strap systems tend to flap around in high\nwinds when binoculars are extended to the eyes, causing flutter and vibration\nthat prevents solid viewing. With a bivy system, the tether straps are narrow\nand thin, and resist catching in the breeze.\n\nAnother small advantage is that the majority of bivy systems include small\npockets or compartments to secure ancillary gear such as calls, wind-checker,\nhunting license, and rangefinder.\n\nDeciding which system to purchase can be difficult, since there are many\nquality models on the market. However, as with any type of hunting gear, the\nsystem must be ultra-quiet, functional, and provide carrying comfort,\nparticularly in warm weather and when shouldering a pack.\n\nI've used several versions, and each has its pros and cons. Some models\nprovide additional protection against the elements by encapsulating the optics\nin fabric or padded material, while others offer less protection to aid in\nfaster access to your binoculars. Great examples of full-protection systems\ninclude KUIU's PRO Bino Harness, Sitka's Bino Bivy, Alaska Guide's Bino Chest\nPack, and ALPS OutdoorZ's Extreme Bino Harness. The S4Gear Lockdown X is a\ngreat example of a hybrid-type design, where the binoculars are not fully\nenveloped in material, yet the system provides solid protection for the\noptics' exposed lenses.\n\nThe new PRO Bino Harness ($99) from KUIU has a moldable case opening and\nstackable \"shims,\" allowing you to custom-fit the case to your binoculars and\noptimize the height at which they are positioned, so you can extract them with\nease. The overlapped lid folds forward, and it can be opened and closed\nsilently with one hand. Two side pockets have easy access elastic openings,\nand the outer material is quiet and, of course, waterproof.\n\nI recently field-tested Sitka's new Mountain Optics Harness ($149), and I\nreally liked what I found. First off, it provides fully padded protection with\na silent magnetic flap. This is a big plus, as now you can pull the optics in\nand out of the pocket with complete ease using only one hand. I often leave\nthe flap open when glassing repeatedly, such as when tiptoeing the final yards\nof a stalk. The flap will bend and tuck out of the way. Another great benefit\nis its special fabric, which the company designed to be as whisper-quiet as\npossible.\n\nThe harness is outfitted with super-thin, low-profile straps, so it rides\ncompletely unobstructed with your pack on. When surveying a number of serious\nhunters, Sitka found that some preferred additional pockets on a binocular\nharness, while others did not. With that in mind, Sitka tried to satisfy all\nby creating removable pouches.\n\nWhile testing this system during a late-season mule deer hunt, I found it easy\nto get on and off. The straps and buckles are very strong and lightweight. I\nalso liked the main chassis' zippered stash pocket that rides against your\nchest--t's perfect for storing a hunting license, big-game tag, and small\nknife. There's also a hidden lens cloth In the main optics pocket.\n\nOverall, if you've been shopping for a bino-bivy system and can't seem to find\none that fulfills every requirement, I'd urge you to take a hard look at the\nones I've mentioned here.\n\nCaption: There are a number of harness systems on the market from companies\nlike ALPS OutdoorZ, KUIU, and Alaska Guide Creations. Most bino harnesses\noffer extreme protection, while others trade maximum protection to improve\nbinocular access. Sitka's new Mountain Optics Harness (above) was designed to\nbe both fast and quiet, yet the system fully encapsulates your binoculars in\nsilent, brushed-fleece fabric.",

What are some other\nbenefits? Also, with so many on the market, which one should I choose?\n<person>J. Munoz</person>, via e-mail</p>\n\n<p>A The advantages to using a bivy system are many. As you said, it\nprovides full protection for your binoculars against harsh weather,\ndust, and trail brush.</p>\n\n<p>However, a well-designed bivy keeps your optics close to your chest\nas well, so you can hustle and jog without worry of your optics swinging\naround your neck or chest. This also improves stalking and crawling\nability--no more dragging binoculars into the dirt, rocks, or mud.\nGlassing in the wind is improved, too. Many elastic chest-strap systems\ntend to flap around in high winds when binoculars are extended to the\neyes, causing flutter and vibration that prevents solid viewing. With a\nbivy system, the tether straps are narrow and thin, and resist catching\nin the breeze.</p>\n\n<p>Another small advantage is that the majority of bivy systems\ninclude small pockets or compartments to secure ancillary gear such as\ncalls, wind-checker, hunting license, and rangefinder.</p>\n\n<p>Deciding which system to purchase can be difficult, since there are\nmany quality models on the market. However, as with any type of hunting\ngear, the system must be ultra-quiet, functional, and provide carrying\ncomfort, particularly in warm weather and when shouldering a pack.</p>\n\n<p>I've used several versions, and each has its pros and cons.\nSome models provide additional protection against the elements by\nencapsulating the optics in fabric or padded material, while others\noffer less protection to aid in faster access to your binoculars. Great\nexamples of full-protection systems include KUIU's PRO <person>Bino\nHarness</person>, Sitka's Bino Bivy, Alaska Guide's Bino Chest Pack,\nand ALPS OutdoorZ's Extreme <person>Bino Harness</person>. The S4Gear Lockdown X is\na great example of a hybrid-type design, where the binoculars are not\nfully enveloped in material, yet the system provides solid protection\nfor the optics' exposed lenses.</p>\n\n<p>The new PRO <person>Bino Harness</person> (<money>$99</money>) from KUIU has a moldable case\nopening and stackable \"shims,\" allowing you to custom-fit the\ncase to your binoculars and optimize the height at which they are\npositioned, so you can extract them with ease. The overlapped lid folds\nforward, and it can be opened and closed silently with one hand. Two\nside pockets have easy access elastic openings, and the outer material\nis quiet and, of course, waterproof.</p>\n\n<p>I recently field-tested Sitka's new Mountain Optics Harness\n(<money>$149</money>), and I really liked what I found. First off, it provides fully\npadded protection with a silent magnetic flap. This is a big plus, as\nnow you can pull the optics in and out of the pocket with complete ease\nusing only one hand. I often leave the flap open when glassing\nrepeatedly, such as when tiptoeing the final yards of a stalk. The flap\nwill bend and tuck out of the way. Another great benefit is its special\nfabric, which the company designed to be as whisper-quiet as possible.</p>\n\n<p>The harness is outfitted with super-thin, low-profile straps, so it\nrides completely unobstructed with your pack on. When surveying a number\nof serious hunters, Sitka found that some preferred additional pockets\non a binocular harness, while others did not. With that in mind, Sitka\ntried to satisfy all by creating removable pouches.</p>\n\n<p>While testing this system during a late-season mule deer hunt, I\nfound it easy to get on and off. The straps and buckles are very strong\nand lightweight. I also liked the main chassis' zippered stash\npocket that rides against your chest--t's perfect for storing a\nhunting license, big-game tag, and small knife. There's also a\nhidden lens cloth In the main optics pocket.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you've been shopping for a bino-bivy system and\ncan't seem to find one that fulfills every requirement, I'd\nurge you to take a hard look at the ones I've mentioned here.</p>\n\n<p>Caption: There are a number of harness systems on the market from\ncompanies like ALPS OutdoorZ, KUIU, and Alaska Guide Creations. Most\nbino harnesses offer extreme protection, while others trade maximum\nprotection to improve binocular access. Sitka's new Mountain Optics\nHarness (above) was designed to be both fast and quiet, yet the system\nfully encapsulates your binoculars in silent, brushed-fleece fabric.</p>",
