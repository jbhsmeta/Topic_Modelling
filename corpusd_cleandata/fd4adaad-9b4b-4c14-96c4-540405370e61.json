    "text": "Tallahassee: Osceola County, The state of Florida has issued the following\nnews release:\n\nOsceola County's all-inclusive SENSES Park recently scored an Achievement\nAward from the National Association of Counties (NACo).\n\nThe awards honor innovative, effective county government programs that\nstrengthen services for residents.\n\nSENSES opened in 2019 and is the first play space in Osceola County\npurposefully designed with children on the Autism spectrum in mind.\nConstructed on the site of a former fire station, it received the NACo\nrecognition in the parks and recreation category for facilities that\n\"revitalize and reimagine existing or create new public spaces that benefit\nresidents and visitors.\"\n\nSENSES is inspiring other nearby communities to plan similar facilities.\n\n\"Our vision and innovation continue to be recognized and this award showcases\na facility that offers exciting opportunities for families in our community,\"\nsaid Commission Chairwoman Viviana Janer, who pushed for the park, which is in\nher District in the Buenaventura Lakes community. \"Inclusion is a key\ncomponent of SENSES Park and this a wonderful space that allows children of\nall abilities to confidently have fun. It supports positive interactions and\nemphasizes the abilities of children with special needs rather than their\ndisabilities.\"\n\nNACo President Mary Ann Borgeson said, \"We are seeing firsthand now more than\never that counties work tirelessly to support our residents. This year's\nAchievement Award-winning programs showcase how counties build healthy, safe\nand vibrant communities across America.\"\n\nAwards are given in 18 different categories that reflect the vast,\ncomprehensive services counties provide. Started in 1970, NACo's annual\nAchievement Awards program is designed to recognize county government\ninnovations. Each nominee is judged on its own merits and not against other\napplications.\n\nAt SENSES, structures are separated by space to allow for self-learning,\nexploration, and less intense social play experiences. Design plans took into\naccount elements such as noise control, population density, and playground\nequipment size to better serve the unique target audience safely. The park\nsite is small enough to gate and enclose, ensuring a more controlled\nenvironment where children can safely wander and explore their environment.\n\nAutism rates are rising in the U.S., and the special needs of children with\nautism spectrum disorders often are not met in traditional recreation\nfacilities. Working with specialists and community partners, Osceola County\ndesigned and built the park to be all-inclusive - welcoming, safe, and\nentertaining for all children. The park is accessible to children with\nphysical disabilities as well, and caregivers for seniors with dementia also\nhave found the park uniquely suited to meet their needs.\n\nSENSES Park is located at 2296 Camelia Drive. The park was previously\nrecognized by the Florida Association of Counties with a Best Practice Award.\n\nThe National Association of Counties (NACo) unites America's 3,069 county\ngovernments. Founded in 1935, NACo brings county officials together to\nadvocate with a collective voice on national policy, exchange ideas and build\nnew leadership skills, pursue transformational county solutions, enrich the\npublic's understanding of county government and exercise exemplary leadership\nin public service.

It supports positive interactions and\nemphasizes the abilities of children with special needs rather than\ntheir disabilities.\"</p>\n\n<p>NACo President <person>Mary Ann Borgeson</person> said, \"We are seeing\nfirsthand now more than ever that counties work tirelessly to support\nour residents. This year's Achievement Award-winning programs\nshowcase how counties build healthy, safe and vibrant communities across\nAmerica.\"</p>\n\n<p>Awards are given in 18 different categories that reflect the vast,\ncomprehensive services counties provide. Started in 1970, NACo's\nannual Achievement Awards program is designed to recognize county\ngovernment innovations. Each nominee is judged on its own merits and not\nagainst other applications.</p>\n\n<p>At SENSES, structures are separated by space to allow for\nself-learning, exploration, and less intense social play experiences.\nDesign plans took into account elements such as noise control,\npopulation density, and playground equipment size to better serve the\nunique target audience safely. The park site is small enough to gate and\nenclose, ensuring a more controlled environment where children can\nsafely wander and explore their environment.</p>\n\n<p>Autism rates are rising in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>, and the special needs of\nchildren with autism spectrum disorders often are not met in traditional\nrecreation facilities. Working with specialists and community partners,\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.oscola\">Osceola County</location> designed and built the park to be all-inclusive -\nwelcoming, safe, and entertaining for all children. The park is\naccessible to children with physical disabilities as well, and\ncaregivers for seniors with dementia also have found the park uniquely\nsuited to meet their needs.</p>\n\n<p><location>SENSES Park</location> is located at <location>2296 Camelia Drive</location>. The park was\npreviously recognized by the <org>Florida Association of Counties</org> with a Best\nPractice Award.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1392343322\">National Association of Counties</org> (NACo) unites America's\n3,069 county governments. Founded in 1935, NACo brings county officials\ntogether to advocate with a collective voice on national policy,\nexchange ideas and build new leadership skills, pursue transformational\ncounty solutions, enrich the public's understanding of county\ngovernment and exercise exemplary leadership in public service.
