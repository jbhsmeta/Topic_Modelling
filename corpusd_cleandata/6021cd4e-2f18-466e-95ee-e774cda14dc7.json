    "text": "CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. \\- While Franklin County already has received more than\n10,000 applications for absentee and mail\u2010in ballots, some residents prefer\nvoting in person for the primary.\n\nFranklin County plans to have all 73 polling places open Tuesday from 7 a.m.\nto 8 p.m.\n\nThe Franklin County Election Board is sending out personal protective\nequipment (PPE) for poll workers, including masks, face shields, gloves,\nantibacterial wipes and hand sanitizer.\n\nTo help keep poll workers safe, the election board requests the following\nthree things from all voters:\n\nWear a face mask.\n\nBring your own ink pen (blue or black ink preferred).\n\nPractice social distancing while in the polling place.\n\nA sign will be posted on the door of each polling place reminding voters of\nthose requests.\n\nIn addition to protective equipment, the board also noted it is taking other\nprecautions to help mitigate the spread of any contagion. They include:\n\nThe curtains to voting booths either will be removed or tied back so that the\nvoter doesn't need to touch the curtain when entering the voting booth.\n\nTabletop privacy dividers will be available so voters can sit at a table and\nvote their ballot privately.\n\nVoters will be encouraged to remain at least 6 feet away from others in line.\n\nVoters are asked to do their best to limit nonessential visitors (children,\ngrandchildren, etc.).\n\nSome polling places will have additional measures in place, including changing\nthe entrance/exit doors, blocking off hallways or lobby areas and prohibiting\nvoters from using the restrooms.\n\nWhile each polling place will have cardboard privacy sleeves for voters to use\nto cover up their voted ballots, it is Franklin County's recommendation that\nvoters turn their ballots upside down to scan them into the precinct scanner.\nThe ballot will be read correctly regardless of its orientation when scanned\ninto the machine.\n\nDue to newly passed legislation, voters no longer will receive numbered stubs\nto take with them after voting. Eliminating the stubs, which caused issues\nwith the precinct scanners, will greatly reduce the amount of spoiled ballots\non primary day.\n\nAnother new provision is that all election results, including write\u2010in votes,\nwill be available on the county's website at\n[www.franklincountypa.gov](http://www.franklincountypa.gov). Results no longer\nwill be placed on the outside door of the polling place that night.\n\nVoters also might see some new faces at their polling places. A number of\nregular poll workers have asked to sit out due to having risk factors that\nmake them more susceptible to serious complications of COVID\u201019.\n\n\"We ask that all voters be patient and understanding with our new poll workers\nwho have graciously stepped up and offered to serve in place of those in their\ncommunity who asked to be relieved of their duties for the upcoming June 2\nelection,\" the release states.\n\nIf voters have requested absentee and mail\u2010in ballots, they can't change their\nminds and show up at their polling place expecting to vote a regular in\u2010person\nballot.\n\nBecause voted ballots can be returned to the voter registration office until\nTuesday at 8 p.m., poll workers won't know whether they already have returned\na voted ballot. The only option for those voters at the polling place is to be\ngiven a provisional ballot.\n\nThe county election board is \"strongly urging\" voters to return their voted\nabsentee or mail\u2010in ballots instead of voting a provisional ballot at the\npolling place.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.chaurg\">CHAMBERSBURG, Pa.</location> - While <person>Franklin County</person> already has received more than 10,000 applications for absentee and mail&#8208;in ballots, some residents prefer voting in person for the primary.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.fralin\">Franklin County</location> plans to have all 73 polling places open Tuesday from <chron>7 a.m. to 8 p.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p><org>The Franklin County Election Board</org> is sending out personal protective equipment (PPE) for poll workers, including masks, face shields, gloves, antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizer.</p>\n\n<p>To help keep poll workers safe, the election board requests the following three things from all voters:</p>\n\n<p>  Wear a face mask.</p>\n\n<p>  Bring your own ink pen (blue or black ink preferred).</p>\n\n<p>  Practice social distancing while in the polling place.</p>\n\n<p>A sign will be posted on the door of each polling place reminding voters of those requests.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to protective equipment, the board also noted it is taking other precautions to help mitigate the spread of any contagion. They include:</p>\n\n<p>  The curtains to voting booths either will be removed or tied back so that the voter doesn't need to touch the curtain when entering the voting booth.</p>\n\n<p>  Tabletop privacy dividers will be available so voters can sit at a table and vote their ballot privately.</p>\n\n<p>  Voters will be encouraged to remain at least 6 feet away from others in line.</p>\n\n<p>  Voters are asked to do their best to limit nonessential visitors (children, grandchildren, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Some polling places will have additional measures in place, including changing the entrance/exit doors, blocking off hallways or lobby areas and prohibiting voters from using the restrooms.</p>\n\n<p>While each polling place will have cardboard privacy sleeves for voters to use to cover up their voted ballots, it is <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.fralin\">Franklin County's</location> recommendation that voters turn their ballots upside down to scan them into the precinct scanner. The ballot will be read correctly regardless of its orientation when scanned into the machine.</p>\n\n<p>Due to newly passed legislation, voters no longer will receive numbered stubs to take with them after voting. Eliminating the stubs, which caused issues with the precinct scanners, will greatly reduce the amount of spoiled ballots on primary day.</p>\n\n<p>Another new provision is that all election results, including write&#8208;in votes, will be available on the county's website at <a href=\"http://www.franklincountypa.gov\">www.franklincountypa.gov</a>. Results no longer will be placed on the outside door of the polling place that night.</p>\n\n<p>Voters also might see some new faces at their polling places. A number of regular poll workers have asked to sit out due to having risk factors that make them more susceptible to serious complications of COVID&#8208;19.</p>\n\n<p>\"We ask that all voters be patient and understanding with our new poll workers who have graciously stepped up and offered to serve in place of those in their community who asked to be relieved of their duties for the upcoming <chron>June 2</chron> election,\" the release states.</p>\n\n<p>If voters have requested absentee and mail&#8208;in ballots, they can't change their minds and show up at their polling place expecting to vote a regular in&#8208;person ballot.</p>\n\n<p>Because voted ballots can be returned to the voter registration office until Tuesday at <chron>8 p.m.</chron>, poll workers won't know whether they already have returned a voted ballot. The only option for those voters at the polling place is to be given a provisional ballot.</p>\n\n<p>The county election board is \"strongly urging\" voters to return their voted absentee or mail&#8208;in ballots instead of voting a provisional ballot at the polling place.</p>",
