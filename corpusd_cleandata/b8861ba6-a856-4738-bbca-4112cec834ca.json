Various resuscitation efforts aim to maintain the body&#8217;s circulatory and respiratory systems during cardiac arrest in an attempt to save the life of the victim. The sooner these resuscitation efforts begin, the better the victim&#8217;s chances of survival. These efforts are expensive and have a limited success rate, and cardiac arrest, among other conditions, continues to claim the lives of victims.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;Aspects and embodiments of the present invention are directed to a wearable therapeutic device with an external defibrillator. The wearable device includes therapy electrodes that are configured to administer an electric shock to a subject. The wearable device also houses receptacles proximate to the therapy electrodes. A control system bursts the receptacles to release a conductive fluid. The conductive fluid, when released from its receptacle, covers at least part of a surface of at least one therapy electrode, reducing the impedance between that therapy electrode and the subject&#8217;s skin.
