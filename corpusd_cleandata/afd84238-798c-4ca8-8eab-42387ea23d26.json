    "text": "The St. Mary's department of public works and transportation at a meeting\nTuesday requested permission from county commissioners to apply for a state\ngrant to build a bicycle and pedestrian path.\n\nJohn Deatrick, the department director, reminded commissioners they sent a\nletter of intent to Maryland Department of Transportation on March 3, after a\nconsultant working on the corridor study of St. Andrew's Church Road\nidentified the need to install a side path along the state road. Currently,\nbikes use the shoulder or travel on roadway's white lines.\n\nAfter sending the letter of intent, they received a letter back confirming\nthey are authorized to apply for the grant, which would \"link Wildewood\nParkway and FDR Boulevard and the shopping center as well as the base,\" he\nsaid. \"We thought this was a great idea.\"\n\nAfter examining a draft concept plan, Commissioner Todd Morgan (R) asked about\nwhat appeared to be a 3-to 4-foot retaining wall on the map, along the path.\n\n\"In one area we have a stormwater facility that we have to avoid,\" Deatrick\nresponded. \"There could be an alternative alignment this is just a draft from\nthe person who did the study. All these these things would have to be\nmitigated through a guardrail or a realignment.\"\n\n\"The rain flows both ways\" along St.\n\nAndrew's Church Road, Morgan said, and expressed a concern that rainwater\nwould hit the wall and create a pond or puddle.\n\nDeatrick said the department does not want to put up a wall but if they are\nrequired, they would need to mitigate \"whatever safety measures would be\nnecessary but there's a place for the water to go.\"\n\n\"I just don't understand the design,\" Morgan said.\n\nDeatrick said he made note of that and would bring it back to commissioners\nlater on during the design stage if they get the grant and the project is\napproved.\n\nCommissioner Eric Colvin (R) mentioned he is \"curious to see how much grant\nfunds will come back\" and \"a bike trail should be an easy project but this\nlooks very complicated to me.\"\n\n\"We are emphasizing to the state we are interested in improving bike safety on\ntheir roads their roads need to do more than carry cars,\" Deatrick said.\n\nCommissioner Mike Hewitt (R) noted the total project cost is recorded at\n$860,000, and asked if it was true the county would contribute $200,000 and\nthe federal grant would cover the remaining $660,000, with Deatrick\nconfirming.\n\n\"This seems like a lousy plan,\" Hewitt said after discussing other traffic\nsafety concerns, with Deatrick replying, \"We think so too.\"\n\nThe commissioners unanimously approved the department's request to submit an\nonline application for the MDOT bike and pedestrian grant.\n\nTwitter:@MadisonEntNews",

Currently, bikes use the shoulder or travel on roadway's white lines.</p>\n\n<p>After sending the letter of intent, they received a letter back confirming they are authorized to apply for the grant, which would \"link <location>Wildewood Parkway</location> and <location>FDR Boulevard</location> and the shopping center as well as the base,\" he said. \"We thought this was a great idea.\"</p>\n\n<p>After examining a draft concept plan, Commissioner <person>Todd Morgan</person> (R) asked about what appeared to be a 3-to 4-foot retaining wall on the map, along the path.</p>\n\n<p>\"In one area we have a stormwater facility that we have to avoid,\" Deatrick responded. \"There could be an alternative alignment   this is just a draft from the person who did the study. All these these things would have to be mitigated through a guardrail or a realignment.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"The rain flows both ways\" along St.</p>\n\n<p><location>Andrew's Church Road</location>, Morgan said, and expressed a concern that rainwater would hit the wall and create a pond or puddle.</p>\n\n<p>Deatrick said the department does not want to put up a wall but if they are required, they would need to mitigate \"whatever safety measures would be necessary   but there's a place for the water to go.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I just don't understand the design,\" Morgan said.</p>\n\n<p>Deatrick said he made note of that and would bring it back to commissioners later on during the design stage if they get the grant and the project is approved.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioner <person>Eric Colvin</person> (R) mentioned he is \"curious to see how much grant funds will come back\" and \"a bike trail should be an easy project but this looks very complicated to me.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We are emphasizing to the state we are interested in improving bike safety on their roads   their roads need to do more than carry cars,\" Deatrick said.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioner <person>Mike Hewitt</person> (R) noted the total project cost is recorded at <money>$860,000</money>, and asked if it was true the county would contribute <money>$200,000</money> and the federal grant would cover the remaining <money>$660,000</money>, with Deatrick confirming.</p>\n\n<p>\"This seems like a lousy plan,\" Hewitt said after discussing other traffic safety concerns, with Deatrick replying, \"We think so too.\"</p>\n\n<p>The commissioners unanimously approved the department's request to submit an online application for the MDOT bike and pedestrian grant.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter:@MadisonEntNews</p>",
