    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at\nTelecommunications Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from\nAlexandria, Virginia, by NewsRx journalists, a patent by the inventors Li,\nMing-Jun (Horseheads, NY); Wu, Qi (Painted Post, NY), filed on September 27,\n2018, was published online on June 8, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent, patent number 10,663,671, is Corning Research &\nDevelopment Corporation (Corning, New York, United States).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"This disclosure relates generally to optical\nconnectivity and more particularly to ferrules for fiber optic connectors,\nfiber optic assemblies incorporating ferrules, and methods for fabricating\nferrules and fiber optic assemblies incorporating ferrules.\n\n\"Optical fibers are useful in a wide variety of applications, including the\ntelecommunications industry for voice, video, and data transmissions. In a\ntelecommunications system that uses optical fibers, there are typically many\nlocations where fiber optic cables carrying the optical fibers connect to\nequipment or other fiber optic cables. To conveniently provide these\nconnections, fiber optic connectors are often provided on the ends of fiber\noptic cables. The process of terminating individual optical fibers from a\nfiber optic cable is referred to as 'connectorization.' Connectorization can\nbe done in a factory, resulting in a 'pre-connectorized ' or 'pre-terminated'\nfiber optic cable, or the field (e.g., using a 'field-installable' fiber optic\nconnector).\n\n\"Regardless of where installation occurs, a fiber optic connector typically\nincludes a ferrule with one or more bores that receive one or more optical\nfibers. The ferrule supports and positions the optical fiber(s) with respect\nto a housing of the fiber optic connector. Thus, when the housing of the fiber\noptic connector is mated with another connector (e.g., in an adapter), an\noptical fiber in the ferrule is positioned in a known, fixed location relative\nto the housing. This allows an optical connection to be established when the\noptical fiber is aligned with another optical fiber provided in the mating\nconnector. For fiber optic connectors including one or more optical fibers\nthat extend to a front face of the ferrule, there is typically physical\ncontact between the front faces of the mating ferrules (and typically the ends\nof the mating fibers) to ensure that the optical connection can be\nestablished.\n\n\"As optical networks march toward 400G Ethernet, optical transceiver speeds of\n25 Gb/s are becoming commonplace with four level pulse amplitude modulation\n(PAM4), and higher data rates are anticipated in the future. The growing\ncomplexity and speed of transceivers elevate the importance of reducing\ninsertion loss for optical connectors. Despite this, optical connectivity\nremains more expensive than copper connectivity, and reducing optical\nconnector cost is essential for optical communications to penetrate deeper\ninto short distance applications.\n\n\"Table 1 shows the connector insertion loss grades defined by International\nElectrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 61753-1, Edition 1.0: 2007-03\n(Fibre optic interconnecting devices and passive components performance\nstandard--Part 1: General and guidance for performance standards). The loss\nnumbers specified in the foregoing standard are based on random mate (or each-\nto-each) measurement as defined by IEC 61300-3-34, Edition 3.0: 2009-01\n(Examinations and measurements--Attenuation of random mated connectors).\nRandom mate values are closer to practical operating conditions than typical\nvalues measured by reference jumpers.\n\n\"TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Attenuation Grade Random mate attenuation Grade A\n(TBD) .ltoreq.0.07 dB mean .ltoreq.0.15 dB max. for >97% of samples Grade B\n.ltoreq.0.12 dB mean .ltoreq.0.25 dB max. for >97% of samples Grade C\n.ltoreq.0.25 dB mean .ltoreq.0.50 dB max. for >97% of samples Grade D\n.ltoreq.0.50 dB mean .ltoreq.1.0 dB max. for >97% of samples\n\n\"Conventional single fiber connectors employ a precision ceramic ferrule as a\nmeans of supporting and aligning the optical fiber for obtaining low\nconnection loss. The ferrule has tight tolerances in outer diameter, inner\ndiameter, and concentricity. The ferrule, which typically is made of zirconia\nceramics, has a diameter of 1.25 mm for LC connectors and a diameter of 2.5 mm\nfor SC, ST, and FC connectors. An optical fiber is inserted into a micro-hole\nof a ferrule with a bonding agent such as epoxy. The optical fiber bonded to\nthe ferrule undergoes cleaving, and multiple steps of polishing are applied to\na fiber-ferrule assembly to obtain an end face geometry that meets\nrequirements for a desired type of physical contact. Exemplary physical\ncontact geometries include, but are not limited to, physical contact (PC),\nangled physical contact (APC), and ultra-physical contact (UPC) geometries.\n\n\"Connector random mating insertion loss is determined by the offset of the\ncenter of the core from the center of the ferrule (e.g., a geometric center\nbased on an outer surface of the ferrule), also known as core to ferrule\neccentricity (CTFE), of the finished connector. Thus, CTFE represents the core\nto ferrule concentricity error. In conventional ferrule-based connectors, CTFE\nis affected primarily by: a) the concentricity between the micro-hole of the\nferrule and the ferrule itself (e.g., the outer profile of the ferrule); b)\nthe concentricity between the optical fiber and the micro-hole; and c) the\nconcentricity between the core of the optical fiber and the cladding layer of\nthe optical fiber. The fit between the outer diameter (OD) of the optical\nfiber and the inner diameter (ID) of the ferrule (as defined by the micro-\nhole) is very critical for low connector insertion loss. If the fiber OD is\nlarger than the ferrule ID, or is simply too close in size to the ferrule ID,\nthen the fiber cannot be inserted into the ferrule. Conversely, if the\ndifference between the ferrule ID and fiber OD is too large, then such size\ndifference will cause a wide distribution in CTFE and result in high connector\ninsertion loss. A ferrule outer diameter and inner diameter typically have a\nstandard deviation of 0.16 .mu.m, while the eccentricity of a typical ferrule\nfollows a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 0.24 .mu.m. The standard\ndeviation of the outer diameter of a typical optical fiber is 0.16 .mu.m, and\nthe core to clad eccentricity follows a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of\n0.13 .mu.m.\n\n\"FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a fiber core 11 within a bare\noptical fiber 4 that is arranged within a small diameter bore section 20 (or\n'micro-hole') of a ferrule 12 having a substantially cylindrical shape. The\nbare optical fiber 4 has an outer diameter (OD) 6 that is smaller than an\ninner diameter (ID) 8 of the micro-hole 20. Three vectors r.sub.1, r.sub.2,\nand r.sub.3 represent three potential sources of variability in CTFE of a\nconventional fiber-ferrule assembly. The first vector r.sub.1 represents\nvariability in CTFE due to non-concentricity of the micro-hole 20 relative to\nthe cylindrical shape of the ferrule 12. The second vector r.sub.2 represents\nvariability in CTFE due to difference between the OD 6 of the bare optical\nfiber 4 and the ID 8 of the micro-hole 20 (restated, non-concentricity of the\ncylindrical bare optical fiber 4 relative to the cylindrical shape of the\nmicro-hole 20, which defines the ID 8). The third vector r.sub.3 represents\nvariability in CTFE due to non-concentricity of the fiber core 11 relative to\nthe cylindrical shape of the bare optical fiber 4 (which defines the OD 6).\n\n\"Various solutions have been proposed to improve the precision of the fiber-\nto-ferrule fit and cancel the eccentricities by orienting the connector. For\ninstance, the fibers and ferrules can be pre-selected into sub-populations\naccording to the OD and ID. Connectors are made with closely matched sub-\npopulations of fibers and ferrules. Another proposed solution involves local\nexpansion of a fiber by a high temperature energy source to create a tight fit\ninto a ferrule. Still another proposed solution involves preassembly of a\nfiber stub and a ferrule with matched OD and ID. Thereafter, a ferrule stub\nassembly is fusion spliced to at least one fiber in a cable assembly.\n\n\"Conventional methods that rely on ferrule-to-fiber matching, precisely\ncontrolling ferrule geometries, and/or precisely controlling a fiber-ferrule\nbonding process to reduce CTFE and connector insertion loss entail complicated\nmanufacturing processes. The industry continues to seek methods for improving\nCTFE and reducing connector insertion loss, but with reduced manufacturing\ncomplexity and cost.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors\nalso obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent: \"Aspects of\nthe present disclosure provide an integrated fiber-ferrule, a fiber optic\nassembly incorporating an integrated fiber-ferrule, and associated fabrication\nmethods. An integrated fiber-ferrule useable as an optical coupling element\nincludes a core that is peripherally surrounded by a cladding layer having a\nlower index of refraction than the core. Direct contact between an outer\ndiameter of the core and an inner diameter of the cladding layer is provided\nwithout an intervening adhesive. An outer diameter of the cladding layer is\ngreater than or equal to 1 mm, and is at least 20 times, at least 50 times, or\nat least 100 times greater than the outer diameter of the core. A fiber optic\nassembly is further provided, with a fusion splice joint joining a front end\nof an optical fiber core and a rear end of a core of the integrated fiber-\nferrule. The optical fiber and the integrated fiber-ferrule each include a\ncladding layer having a lower index of refraction than the corresponding core,\nwith the cladding layer of the integrated fiber-ferrule being substantially\nlarger (e.g., at least five, at least ten, or at least twenty times larger)\nthan the cladding layer of the optical fiber. Methods for fabricating a fiber\noptic assembly are further provided. A glass preform may be drawn into a glass\ncane and subsequently cut into one or more portions.

As a result, use of an\nintegrated fiber-ferrule permits CTFE and concomitant connector insertion loss\nto be reduced. Moreover, integrated fiber-ferrules as disclosed herein may\nentail reduced manufacturing complexity and cost.\n\n\"In one embodiment of the disclosure, a fiber optic assembly is provided. The\nfiber optic assembly comprises an optical fiber, an integrated fiber-ferrule,\nand a fusion splice joint. The optical fiber includes a first core and a first\ncladding layer. The first cladding layer has a lower index of refraction than\nthe first core. The integrated fiber-ferrule includes a second core and a\nsecond cladding layer. The second cladding layer has a lower index of\nrefraction than the second core. The second cladding layer includes an outer\ndiameter at least five times larger than an outer diameter of the first\ncladding layer. The fusion splice joint joins a front end of the first core\nand a rear end of the second core.\n\n\"In another embodiment of the disclosure, an optical coupling element\nconfigured as an integrated fiber-ferrule is provided. The optical coupling\nelement comprises a core and a cladding layer. The core has a first index of\nrefraction, and is peripherally surrounded by the cladding layer.

In a telecommunications system that uses optical fibers, there are typically many locations where fiber optic cables carrying the optical fibers connect to equipment or other fiber optic cables. To conveniently provide these connections, fiber optic connectors are often provided on the ends of fiber optic cables. The process of terminating individual optical fibers from a fiber optic cable is referred to as &#8216;connectorization.&#8217; Connectorization can be done in a factory, resulting in a &#8216;pre-connectorized &#8216; or &#8216;pre-terminated&#8217; fiber optic cable, or the field (e.g., using a &#8216;field-installable&#8217; fiber optic connector).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Regardless of where installation occurs, a fiber optic connector typically includes a ferrule with one or more bores that receive one or more optical fibers. The ferrule supports and positions the optical fiber(s) with respect to a housing of the fiber optic connector. Thus, when the housing of the fiber optic connector is mated with another connector (e.g., in an adapter), an optical fiber in the ferrule is positioned in a known, fixed location relative to the housing. This allows an optical connection to be established when the optical fiber is aligned with another optical fiber provided in the mating connector. For fiber optic connectors including one or more optical fibers that extend to a front face of the ferrule, there is typically physical contact between the front faces of the mating ferrules (and typically the ends of the mating fibers) to ensure that the optical connection can be established.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As optical networks march toward 400G Ethernet, optical transceiver speeds of 25 Gb/s are becoming commonplace with four level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4), and higher data rates are anticipated in the future. The growing complexity and speed of transceivers elevate the importance of reducing insertion loss for optical connectors. Despite this, optical connectivity remains more expensive than copper connectivity, and reducing optical connector cost is essential for optical communications to penetrate deeper into short distance applications.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Table 1 shows the connector insertion loss grades defined by <org>International Electrotechnical Commission</org> (IEC) standard 61753-1, Edition 1.0: 2007-03 (Fibre optic interconnecting devices and passive components performance standard--Part 1: General and guidance for performance standards). The loss numbers specified in the foregoing standard are based on random mate (or each-to-each) measurement as defined by IEC 61300-3-34, Edition 3.0: 2009-01 (Examinations and measurements--Attenuation of random mated connectors). Random mate values are closer to practical operating conditions than typical values measured by reference jumpers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 Attenuation <person>Grade Random</person> mate attenuation Grade A (TBD) .ltoreq.0.07 dB mean .ltoreq.0.15 dB max. for &gt;97% of samples Grade B .ltoreq.0.12 dB mean .ltoreq.0.25 dB max. for &gt;97% of samples Grade C .ltoreq.0.25 dB mean .ltoreq.0.50 dB max. for &gt;97% of samples Grade D .ltoreq.0.50 dB mean .ltoreq.1.0 dB max. for &gt;97% of samples</p>\n<p>&#8220;Conventional single fiber connectors employ a precision ceramic ferrule as a means of supporting and aligning the optical fiber for obtaining low connection loss. The ferrule has tight tolerances in outer diameter, inner diameter, and concentricity. The ferrule, which typically is made of zirconia ceramics, has a diameter of 1.25 mm for LC connectors and a diameter of 2.5 mm for SC, ST, and FC connectors. An optical fiber is inserted into a micro-hole of a ferrule with a bonding agent such as epoxy. The optical fiber bonded to the ferrule undergoes cleaving, and multiple steps of polishing are applied to a fiber-ferrule assembly to obtain an end face geometry that meets requirements for a desired type of physical contact. Exemplary physical contact geometries include, but are not limited to, physical contact (PC), angled physical contact (APC), and ultra-physical contact (UPC) geometries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Connector random mating insertion loss is determined by the offset of the center of the core from the center of the ferrule (e.g., a geometric center based on an outer surface of the ferrule), also known as core to ferrule eccentricity (CTFE), of the finished connector. Thus, CTFE represents the core to ferrule concentricity error. In conventional ferrule-based connectors, CTFE is affected primarily by: a) the concentricity between the micro-hole of the ferrule and the ferrule itself (e.g., the outer profile of the ferrule); b) the concentricity between the optical fiber and the micro-hole; and c) the concentricity between the core of the optical fiber and the cladding layer of the optical fiber. The fit between the outer diameter (OD) of the optical fiber and the inner diameter (ID) of the ferrule (as defined by the micro-hole) is very critical for low connector insertion loss. If the fiber OD is larger than the ferrule ID, or is simply too close in size to the ferrule ID, then the fiber cannot be inserted into the ferrule. Conversely, if the difference between the ferrule ID and fiber OD is too large, then such size difference will cause a wide distribution in CTFE and result in high connector insertion loss. A ferrule outer diameter and inner diameter typically have a standard deviation of 0.16 .mu.m, while the eccentricity of a typical ferrule follows a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 0.24 .mu.m. The standard deviation of the outer diameter of a typical optical fiber is 0.16 .mu.m, and the core to clad eccentricity follows a Rayleigh distribution with a mode of 0.13 .mu.m.</p>\n<p>&#8220;FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a fiber core 11 within a bare optical fiber 4 that is arranged within a small diameter bore section 20 (or &#8216;micro-hole&#8217;) of a ferrule 12 having a substantially cylindrical shape. The bare optical fiber 4 has an outer diameter (OD) 6 that is smaller than an inner diameter (ID) 8 of the micro-hole 20. Three vectors r.sub.1, r.sub.2, and r.sub.3 represent three potential sources of variability in CTFE of a conventional fiber-ferrule assembly. The first vector r.sub.1 represents variability in CTFE due to non-concentricity of the micro-hole 20 relative to the cylindrical shape of the ferrule 12. The second vector r.sub.2 represents variability in CTFE due to difference between the OD 6 of the bare optical fiber 4 and the ID 8 of the micro-hole 20 (restated, non-concentricity of the cylindrical bare optical fiber 4 relative to the cylindrical shape of the micro-hole 20, which defines the ID 8). The third vector r.sub.3 represents variability in CTFE due to non-concentricity of the fiber core 11 relative to the cylindrical shape of the bare optical fiber 4 (which defines the OD 6).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Various solutions have been proposed to improve the precision of the fiber-to-ferrule fit and cancel the eccentricities by orienting the connector. For instance, the fibers and ferrules can be pre-selected into sub-populations according to the OD and ID. Connectors are made with closely matched sub-populations of fibers and ferrules. Another proposed solution involves local expansion of a fiber by a high temperature energy source to create a tight fit into a ferrule. Still another proposed solution involves preassembly of a fiber stub and a ferrule with matched OD and ID. Thereafter, a ferrule stub assembly is fusion spliced to at least one fiber in a cable assembly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Conventional methods that rely on ferrule-to-fiber matching, precisely controlling ferrule geometries, and/or precisely controlling a fiber-ferrule bonding process to reduce CTFE and connector insertion loss entail complicated manufacturing processes. The industry continues to seek methods for improving CTFE and reducing connector insertion loss, but with reduced manufacturing complexity and cost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent: &#8220;Aspects of the present disclosure provide an integrated fiber-ferrule, a fiber optic assembly incorporating an integrated fiber-ferrule, and associated fabrication methods.
