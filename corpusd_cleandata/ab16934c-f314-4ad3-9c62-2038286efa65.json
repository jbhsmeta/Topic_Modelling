    "text": "Walt Disney Co.'s recent announcement that it will stop paying more than\n100,000 employees represents the latest blow to entertainment industry workers\nin a continuing wave of cuts, furloughs and layoffs spawned by the Covid-19\ncrisis.\n\nEven Disney, one of the world's largest media companies and the biggest public\ncompany in Los Angeles with a market cap of more than $183 billion (down from\n$221 billion in late February) could not withstand the financial fallout of\nthe pandemic.\n\nThe company has been forced to shut down Disneyland and other theme parks in\nthe United States, Europe and Asia. On April 20, reports surfaced that the\nentertainment giant would place 100,000 employees--nearly half of its\nworkforce-- on unpaid leave in a move expected to save the company $500\nmillion per month.\n\nMost of the cuts come from Disney's theme park staff.\n\nDisney heiress Abigail Disney immediately took to Twitter to blast the\ndecision to furlough the workers while retaining executive bonuses typically\nworth $1.5 billion.\n\n\"Pay the people who make the magic happen with respect and dignity they have\nmore than earned from you. BE DECENT,\" Disney wrote.\n\nExecutive Chairman Bob Iger has said he will forgo his $3 million salary, and\nthere have been reports that new Chief Executive Bob Chapek would either forgo\nor take a 50% cut to his $2.5 million annual salary. Other senior executives\nwill be taking 20% salary cuts for the duration of the crisis.\n\nHowever, some have complained that most top executive compensation comes from\nbonuses.\n\nEmployee cuts also are in the works at NBCUniversal, which is similarly\ndependent on theme parks along with its media operations. Its theme park\nattractions include Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City and\nUniversal Orlando, both shuttered in mid-March.\n\nIn early April, NBC Universal said it would furlough its part-time hourly\nworkers beginning May 3 and that full-time employees would suffer 20% pay\ncuts.\n\nOther major studios in greater Los Angeles, including Sony Corp., Warner Bros.\nEntertainment Inc. and ViacomCBS Inc. subsidiary Paramount Pictures Corp.,\nhave not announced major layoffs or furloughs.\n\nBut all of Hollywood's major studios are content producers as well as\ndistributors, and so are affected by production shutdowns that have idled film\nand television producers, casts, and crews.\n\nHigh-profile movies that have halted production or had their release dates\nshuffled include \"The Matrix 4,\" produced by Village Roadshow Pictures and\ndistributed by Warner Bros.; \"The Batman,\" produced by DC Films and\ndistributed by Warner Bros, and \"Dominion,\" the next chapter in Universal's\nlucrative \"Jurassic World\" franchise.\n\nNetworks and streaming services are, in some cases, juggling airdates to\naccommodate lack of product. But series production is virtually shut down.\n\nNBC ceased production on 35 shows on March 13. HBO's \"Barry\" and \"Succession\"\nare among series that have shut down indefinitely.\n\nThe Fox hit \"Empire\" will end its sixth season run one week early on May 18\nbecause the series was unable to shoot the season finale that was scheduled to\nair on May 21.\n\nWith production shutdowns, there are fewer deals to be made, so it's not\nsurprising L.A.'s major talents agencies are suffering cutbacks as well.\n\nBeverly Hills-based Endeavor is reportedly expected to complete ongoing\nfurloughs and pay cuts affecting as much as one-third of the company's\n7,500-member workforce by late May.\n\nIn late March, Paradigm Talent Agency laid off 250 staff members, reportedly\nincluding some top agents in music, motion pictures and TV literature.\n\nTalent agencies ICM Partners, Creative Artists Agency and United Talent Agency\nhave not announced layoffs at the executive or staff level to date, but CAA\nhas announced pay cuts of up to 50%, and Variety reported that ICM \"floating\nassistants,\" the term used to describe support staff not assigned to a\nspecific agent or department, have been laid off as operations have gone\nremote.\n\nBy DIANE HAITHMAN Staff Reporter\n\nCaption: Happiest Place? Disney will stop paying more than 100,000 employees.",
