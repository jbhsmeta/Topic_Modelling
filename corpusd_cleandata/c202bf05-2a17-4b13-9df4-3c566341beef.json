    "text": "Nearly every aspect of business in Los Angeles has adapted in one way or\nanother to the challenges--and opportunities--of a world working remotely.\n\nSome of those moves are well-documented, by the Business Journal and\nelsewhere, but we're learning on a daily basis about other ways that members\nof the community are stepping up and helping out.\n\nLike Pepperdine University's Graziadio Business School, which acted fast once\nsafer-at-home guidelines were implemented. Within a week of lockdown measures\nbeing announced, the school's MBA program had shifted all coursework online--\nno small feat --to ensure students remained on track for graduation.\n\nBut Pepperdine didn't stop there. It also decided to host free webinars to\nhelp coach local businesses through the Covid-19 crisis. Educators driving\nthese programs include Charla Griffy Brown, professor of information systems\nand technology management, and Izzy Justice, a neuroscientist and Silicon\nValley entrepreneur who works with medical professionals.\n\n\"The novel Covid-19 is reorienting our relationship with business, education\nand the outside world, and transforming the way we live, work and learn,\" said\nGraziadio Dean Deryck J. van Rensburg.\n\n\"Pepperdine Graziadio can help businesses benefit from preparing now for their\nrecovery. More than 20 faculty members are working together to offer their\nadvice in public forums and the media on how businesses should approach their\ncomeback plans,\" van Rensburg added.\n\nOn tap for the Pepperdine sessions are topics such as management, leadership,\nfinance and lending, strategy and planning, human resources and organizational\ndevelopment.\n\nEl Segundo-based Aerojet Rocketdyne is making an effort during the Covid-19\ncrisis to support communities where the company's facilities are located. The\nAerojet Rocketdyne Foundation has launched a campaign to donate up to $750,000\nto organizations supporting relief efforts in areas across the country.\n\nTheir dining rooms remain closed, but that hasn't stopped establishments from\nsigning on for Pasadena Restaurant Week. Running from April 26-May 2, the\nTake-Out Edition of the event features more than 50 eateries dishing up to-go\nversions of their favorite meals. It's a great excuse for locals to show their\nsupport.\n\nSCOTT ROBSON, EDITOR",
