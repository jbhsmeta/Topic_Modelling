    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health &\nMedicine Daily \\-- Current study results on Proteins - Serum Globulins have\nbeen published. According to news reporting out of Istanbul, Turkey, by NewsRx\neditors, research stated, \"The survival of a semi-allogeneic fetus depends on\nseveral immunological mechanisms, and it has been suggested that recurrent\npregnancy loss (RPL) could develop as a result of one or more immunological\nabnormalities. Compatibility between partners for human leukocyte antigen\n(HLA) genotypes and the relationships between maternal killer-cell\nimmunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and paternal HLA-Bw4/Bw6 and HLA-C1/C2\nsupra-groups were investigated in 25 couples with RPL in comparison to healthy\ncouples with children.\"\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Marmara\nUniversity, \"HLA and KIR genotyping was performed using polymerase chain\nreaction with sequence-specific primers and/or sequence-specific\noligonucleotides. HLA class I incompatibility between partners, especially in\nHLA-B alleles, was more common in the RPL group (p=0.01). HLA-C2 homozygosity\nwas more frequent in the male partners of RPL couples than in other groups\n(p=0.03). The KIR2DL5 gene frequency was significantly higher in both the\nfemale and male partners of RPL couples, whereas the KIR2DS3 gene frequency in\nmale partners of RPL couples was significantly reduced (p=0.03). The presence\nof KIR2DL3 in women with RPL was correlated with the presence of HLA-C2\nalleles in their spouses (p=0.03). Our data from a Turkish population suggest\nthat male HLA-C2 homozygosity may play an important role in RPL. Additionally,\nan incidental match between male HLA-C2 and female HLA-C1 ligand KIR receptors\nmight perturb the balance between activatory and inhibitory KIR-ligand\ninteractions during pregnancy in couples affected by RPL.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The roles of orphan\nKIR2DL5 and orphan KIR2DS3 in RPL remain obscure.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Maternal killer-cell\nimmunoglobulin-like receptors and paternal human leukocyte antigen ligands in\nrecurrent pregnancy loss cases in Turkey. _Clinical and Experimental\nReproductive Medicine_ , 2020;():.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting A. Tulunay, Dept. of Immunology, Marmara University, School of\nMedicine, Istanbul, Turkey. Additional authors for this research include M.O.\nElbasi, H. Karagozoglu, S. Kahraman and E.

    "title": "Researchers from Marmara University Provide Details of New Studies and Findings in the Area of Serum Globulins (Maternal killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors and paternal human leukocyte antigen ligands in recurrent pregnancy loss cases in ...): Proteins - Serum Globulins",
    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Health &amp; Medicine Daily</org> -- Current study results on Proteins - Serum Globulins have been published. According to news reporting out of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/tr..istnbl\">Istanbul, Turkey</location>, by NewsRx editors, research stated, &#8220;The survival of a semi-allogeneic fetus depends on several immunological mechanisms, and it has been suggested that recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) could develop as a result of one or more immunological abnormalities. Compatibility between partners for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and the relationships between maternal killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and paternal HLA-Bw4/Bw6 and HLA-C1/C2 supra-groups were investigated in 25 couples with RPL in comparison to healthy couples with children.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from <org>Marmara University</org>, &#8220;HLA and KIR genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers and/or sequence-specific oligonucleotides. HLA class I incompatibility between partners, especially in HLA-B alleles, was more common in the RPL group (p=0.01). HLA-C2 homozygosity was more frequent in the male partners of RPL couples than in other groups (p=0.03). The KIR2DL5 gene frequency was significantly higher in both the female and male partners of RPL couples, whereas the KIR2DS3 gene frequency in male partners of RPL couples was significantly reduced (p=0.03). The presence of KIR2DL3 in women with RPL was correlated with the presence of HLA-C2 alleles in their spouses (p=0.03). Our data from a Turkish population suggest that male HLA-C2 homozygosity may play an important role in RPL. Additionally, an incidental match between male HLA-C2 and female HLA-C1 ligand KIR receptors might perturb the balance between activatory and inhibitory KIR-ligand interactions during pregnancy in couples affected by RPL.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;The roles of orphan KIR2DL5 and orphan KIR2DS3 in RPL remain obscure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Maternal killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors and paternal human leukocyte antigen ligands in recurrent pregnancy loss cases in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tr\">Turkey</location>. <em>Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine</em>, 2020;():.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting A.
