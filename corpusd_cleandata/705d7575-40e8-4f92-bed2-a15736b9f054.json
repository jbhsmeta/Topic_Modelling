She plans to study elementary education at the University of\nNebraska at Kearney.\n\nGoals: I plan to return to my hometown and find an open teaching position in\none of the four elementary schools. After teaching for a few years, I plan to\nreturn to college and work toward a master's and doctorate. I hope to obtain\nmy degrees within a six-year range to potentially work for the school\nadministration. My ultimate goal is to become a superintendent. Through the\ncourse of these instances, I plan to assist my parents to pay off the mortgage\nof our current home to ease their strain of work as they grow older, all while\nsaving for my own home. This will allow me to further give back to my parents,\nfuture family and community.\n\nIn her own words: \"My mother and father were both born in a rural area of\nZacatecas, Mexico. Both their lives were dominated by the poverty that was in\ntheir region. Consequently, my parents were forced to discontinue their\neducation. As their child, I am often told of the endless stories and\nhardships my mother and father had to face to be in the country. Their\nstruggles have been the everyday motivation that has driven me to be the\nstudent I am. I constantly remind myself of what my parents did for me to be\nin a place of freedom and opportunity. Lexington is known to be one of the\nvery few towns of Nebraska where diversity exists. Within these ethnicities,\nan individual can see noticeable differences between the lives of these\ngroups. These differences, along with my parents' hardships, have been the\nreason that has further driven me into pursuing an education.\"\n\nAchievements and awards include: Valedictorian, honor roll four years,\ndistinguished scholar four years, Kearney Bound scholar, Spanish honor roll,\nNational Society of High School Scholars.\n\nActivities: Tennis.\n\nCommunity and volunteer service: Community food pantry, community trash\npickup, volunteer with the youth tennis program, teacher aide, volunteer at\ncommunity movie theater, Spanish translator at school conferences.\n\nMost influential teacher: Jerry and Terri Wylie, Lexington Public Schools.\n\n\"I have grown to be fond of a select few of my teachers throughout my\nschooling. Two of the teachers I will always remember are Mr. and Mrs. Wylie.\nThese teachers took the time to get to know me as a student and child. They\nhave been sources of inspiration to pursue a career in education. These\neducators not only made me enjoy the time I spent at school, but also made me\nfeel welcomed and essential. They evoked happiness and peace whenever I was in\nthe classroom. Both of them let me know that no matter where I came from, I'd\nbe accepted and cared for unconditionally. To this day it is a great joy to\nsee them and say hi.\"\n\nKate Axthelm\n\nBrady High School\n\nKate is the daughter of Jason and Sharon Axthelm of Brady. She plans to study\nnursing at Mid-Plains Community College.\n\nGoals: Become a hospice nurse and simply be happy, healthy, and surrounded by\nloved ones.\n\nIn her own words: \"I've lived in rural Brady my whole life. My life has been\nenriched by going to a small school and living in a small community. Here in\nNebraska, I have grown to be the person I am because of the people in my\ncommunity building me up, supporting me, investing in me and believing in me.\nNowhere else, I feel, can students reach their full potential than in a small\ntown. I want to make my school proud by being the best version of myself that\nI can be. My parents and community members support me in everything I do,\nwhich makes me want to push myself for them.\"\n\nAchievements and awards include: National Honor Society, honor roll with\ndistinction four years, valedictorian, President's Award, Academic All-State\nin multiple sports, math achievement award, American history award, personal\nfinance academic achievement award, FSC excellence and leadership award.\n\nActivities: National Honor Society, volleyball, basketball, band, FCCLA, one-\nact play, speech.\n\nCommunity and volunteer service: Community Halloween, community Santa Night,\nfamily fun night, Christmas historical village, blood drive, youth tournaments\nreferee, volunteer at public library.\n\nMost Influential Teacher: Andy Seamann, Brady Schools.\n\n\"Mr. Seamann was my most influential teacher throughout my high school career\n(also junior high). He has always pushed me, wanting me to reach my full\npotential. He was my weights teacher, but his coaching didn't just stop in the\ngym. He constantly held me accountable in the classroom, along with sports.\nMr. Seamann gave me tips for sports on ways to improve myself and ways to\nbecome a better teammate and leader to my team. But he also was a listening\near when I needed someone to listen, about anything (even when he probably\ndidn't want to hear it). Mr. Seamann will forever be a role model to me. I\nwill cherish his guidance and motivation with me wherever I go.\"\n\nBethany Burklund\n\nHershey High School\n\nBethany is the daughter of Brent and Holly Burklund of North Platte.

I always was and am doing something, thinking about\nsomething or working on something. I'm a very goal-oriented person. When I\nhave a goal in mind, I will put my all into reaching that goal. I'm very\ndetermined with a drive to succeed. From a young age, I recognized the\nimportance in education and getting involved. I knew that I wanted to have a\nsuccessful career and, in order to do so, I would have to put forth my best\neffort into school. My parents really pushed me when I was young to volunteer\nand get involved in my community. I saw the effect that it had in growing me\nas a person.

This is\na lot of the reason I've chosen the career path I have.\"\n\nAchievements and awards include: Honor roll four years, second and third place\nin business communication at Inter-High Day, fifth place in health care\nadministration and personal finance at state FBLA, national FBLA qualifier,\nHershey School student of the month.\n\nActivities: National Honor Society, FBLA vice president, Quiz Bowl, one-act\nplay, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, tennis, art club, Health Careers\nAcademy, Nebraskaland University, UNK health sciences camp.\n\nCommunity and volunteer service: Great Plains Health JV Ambassador, North\nPlatte Berean Church screen projection, Rape and Domestic Abuse Program Peer\nAdvocacy Group, Royal Family Kids Camp, Hershey Public Schools backpack food\nprogram, Maranatha Bible Camp craft shop, Hershey elementary chemistry\ndemonstration, Cody elementary fun night, Hershey Public Schools track\ninvitational set-up, Hirschfeld's Prom Shoppe Crowns and Gowns ambassador,\norganized fundraiser dance at Hershey Public Schools, North Platte Berean\nChurch community Easter egg hunt.\n\nMost influential teacher: Cynthia Elliott, Hershey High School.\n\n\"I have taken Mrs. Elliott's classes now for all four years of high school. I\nremember my first day of freshman year at a new school, she looked every\nstudent in the eyes and told us that these next four years would go faster\nthan we could ever imagine. She warned us not to take them for granted and to\nenjoy the ride. That was just her first piece of helpful advice that she would\ngive me over the next several years. She was also my NHS and FBLA sponsor.\nMrs. Elliott has always been the teacher that I can talk to and trust. She\ntruly loves her students and her job, and that really shows through. As an\ninstructor, she teaches very thoroughly and understandably. She pushes each\nand every one of her students and wants all of them to succeed. She has\nencouraged me and pushed me to work hard to achieve my goals. Mrs. Elliott\nalso traveled to San Antonio with me as a sponsor when I made it to FBLA\nnationals.\"\n\nJack Carlson\n\nNorth Platte High School\n\nJack is the son of Lance and Vikki Carlson of North Platte. He plans to study\nmusic education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nGoals: I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in music education so I can obtain\nexperience in the teaching and mentoring side of music in order to broaden my\nmarketability. Later on, I will likely continue with a master's degree in\nmusic education once again or in music performance. Ultimately my dream is to\nteach at a college/university, or to be performing and privately teaching.\nPersonally, I want to make music with and for others to point toward the glory\nof God.\n\nIn his own words: \"Being a musician has helped me be a person with a good work\nethic and dedication to my studies, but my heart simply wants to make music\nwith and for people. Ultimately pursuing a graduate's degree to work as a\nprofessor or try my hand in the world of performance is the way I hope to live\nout this desire in my heart. Ultimately I hope to use what I have learned to\nhelp guide others toward the more beautiful truths in life. Doing so as a\nteacher would also be a huge learning experience for myself. Studying music in\ncollege will let my passion for creating art with and for others grow even\nlarger and allow me to critically apply it to everyday life as an adult.\"\n\nAchievements and awards include: National Honor Society, honor roll four\nyears, David Distinguished Scholar, Nebraska Legends Scholar, Nebraska Young\nArtist scholarship, Ugai-Smolan scholarship, All-State Orchestra, Wesleyan\nHonor Orchestra outstanding orchestral musician award, lettered in band,\norchestra and choir, Homecoming king, Mid-Plains Community College Presidents\nList.\n\nActivities: National Honor Society, concert, jazz, pep and marching band,\nconcert and jazz choir, concert orchestra, musical, student council, tennis,\nsoccer, superintendent senior student advisory council.\n\nCommunity and volunteer service: Church worship team, Backyard Bible Club,\nMiami mission trip, national anthem performance.\n\nMost Influential Teacher: Marta Holscher-Nelson, North Platte.\n\n\"Ms. Marta Holscher-Nelson was the first person to open up the world of music\nto me. From learning classic American melodies, to miniature musicals, to\nlearning how to play the recorder, Ms. Holscher-Nelson taught and exemplified\nthe beauty in music to me. She encouraged me to be part of the high school\nmusicals (when there were roles in the cast, of course) and always came to our\nclasses with a contagious enthusiasm. I vividly remember watching videos from\nQuaver's Music about all the musical instruments and terms. Even more so, I\nrecall a field trip to the local music store, Kittle's. It was there I knew I\nwanted to play an instrument after trying them all out. Ms. Holscher-Nelson\nshowed me all music had to offer, and paved the way for every relationship I\nnow hold with my amazing music teachers.

Mr.\nSpiegel was the teacher that I feel like I could relate to the most and he\nwould always listen to what I had to say. No matter what the situation was he\nwas willing to help. Being a younger teacher I think it was easier for him to\nrelate to the situations that we face in high school and he is always willing\nto help me with college questions or even something not related to school.\nSpiegel was also one of my football coaches for three years and he always knew\nhow to bring the best out of me on the field and in his classroom.\"\n\nCourtney Kastens\n\nAnselmo-Merna High School\n\nCourtney is the daughter of Matt and Marci Kastens of Anselmo.

During my freshman and sophomore year, it was a struggle for\nme to earn the grades I felt I deserved, but eventually I began to understand\nwhy she graded so strictly and how to work to the best of my ability. When I\nfirst participated in competitive speech in my junior year, she helped build\nmy confidence up in a way that I don't believe anyone else could have.

I have always been a curious person,\nand that curiosity inside of me makes learning fun and enjoyable. I have\nespecially taken a liking to science classes. There is nothing more\ninteresting to me than learning about how and why the universe, and everything\nin it, works the way it does. To help the world, I want to discover the\nsecrets of the universe's inner workings, and use that knowledge to create\nsomething worthwhile.

He is a science\nteacher, and he has taught me earth science, biology and anatomy. His classes\nhave always been fun and entertaining, which makes his classes engaging. I\nlearn in his class, and I seem to retain the information for a longer period\nof time than other classes. Science is also my favorite subject and Mr.\nO'Malley happens to be amazing at teaching it. He understands the material and\npresents it in a way that engages the mind, is easy enough to understand, and\nin a way that I will remember it for a long period of time. He leaves some of\nthe connections up to the students to make, which is much better than simply\nregurgitating information and having the students write it all down.\"\n\nMolly Paxton\n\nMullen High School\n\nMolly is the daughter of Dusty and Mindy Paxton of Tryon. She plans to study\nbiological science and pre-medicine at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nGoals: I have focused my passions and goals around becoming a doctor. After my\nhigh school graduation from Mullen Public Schools in May 2020, I plan to\neither attend the University of Nebraska Lincoln or Nebraska Wesleyan in the\nfall. For my undergraduate degree I will study biological sciences and the\npre-medicine pathway. If I choose Wesleyan, I plan on running cross country\nand track at the collegiate level. Upon graduation, I plan to attend medical\nschool either at the University of Nebraska Medical Center or Creighton. My\ncareer goal is to become an obstetrician. I would also like to specialize in\ndiabetic patients. I have a passion for helping people, and I would love to\nhelp bring life into the world. This career is my most appealing choice at the\nmoment, I job-shadowed an OB/GYN in North Platte to help me prepare for my\nplans and goals, and I enjoyed learning about the profession. If being an\nobstetrician isn't in my future, my second option is to be a dermatologist.\nThis option appeals to me because I wouldn't have to be on call, and if I have\na family, it would be easier to balance work and home life. Upon obtaining a\ndoctorate degree, I plan to move back west in the Kearney or Grand Island area\nto practice. As of right now, my plans are pretty set in stone, but there is\nalways a possibility of change, and I am excited to start my adult life and\nfigure out where my path may lead.\n\nIn her own words: \"Academics and my community have always been extremely\nimportant to me. As a little girl, I was always interested in learning as much\nas possible from as many people as possible, and that mentality has not\nchanged as I have aged. My parents have always motivated me to be the absolute\nbest version of myself that I can be at all times. I have also been blessed\nwith the most supportive and uplifting teachers and community that I could ask\nfor. I am extremely proud of where I come from, and that motivates me to make\nthem proud with everything that I do. Lastly, I am motivated to achieve\nbecause I have high goals and plans for my future. In order to accomplish\nthem, I must always remain self-driven and determined. I have many people to\nthank for holding me accountable, and I will never be able to repay them.\"\n\nAchievements and awards include: National Honor Society vice president, honor\nroll four years, Academic All-State in cross country and speech, Presidential\nAward for academic excellence, U.S. Bank Believer and Achiever, valedictorian,\nstate speech qualifier, state track, cross country and basketball qualifier,\nFCCLA state secretary, Miss Teen Rodeo Nebraska, Nebraska High School Rodeo\nQueen, student council president.\n\nActivities: National Honor Society, volleyball, cross country, basketball,\ntrack, speech, FCCLA, FFA, high school, Spanish honor society, TeamMates,\nstudent council.\n\nCommunity and volunteer service: Partner Up Rodeo, National Honor Society\nfeeding the homeless and Scholastic Book Fair, FCCLA Read-A-Thon, 4-H projects\nincluding painting the fairgrounds, community cleanup, teaching horse 4-H and\nturtle races at the fair, TeamMates Christmas cards for veterans.\n\nMost influential teacher: Sara Hardin, Mullen High School.\n\n\"Sarah Hardin is absolutely my most influential teacher. Throughout my years\nat Mullen High School, I have taken every opportunity possible to be in her\nclassroom. I have never had a teacher that has forced me to be organized, held\nme accountable, and has been so determined to help their students succeed\nquite like she has. She is also a big part of why I chose to pursue a degree\nin biology. While taking her classes, if I ever had an issue or didn't\nunderstand a concept, she was always there to lend a helping hand. Mrs. Hardin\nis one of a kind. She is extremely passionate about teaching, and I hope to be\nas motivated and determined in my career as her. I will never be able to thank\nher enough for all that she has taught me, but I will remember her wisdom and\nenthusiasm forever.\"\n\nSydney Pelster\n\nWallace High School\n\nSydney is the daughter of Ben and Jill Pelster of Wallace.

I know that I have the skills and work ethic necessary\nto be successful.\n\nIn her own words: \"I am motivated to achieve academically and in the community\nby knowing that I can be a role model for younger members of my school and\ncommunity, wanting to make a positive impact on my community, and setting\nmyself up for success in the future. Some of my favorite moments from high\nschool are when I have younger students come up to me after events and tell me\nthat someday they hope to be having as much fun and success as I am in high\nschool. Part of my motivation also comes from the fact that I know I am making\na positive impact on my community by the things that I am doing.\n\n\"The final thing that motivates me to achieve is knowing that I can make the\nmost of my opportunities in high school to set me up for success in college\nand life after college.\"\n\nAchievements and awards include: Honor roll four years, David Scholarship,\nNebraska Business Honors Academy, Academic All-State volleyball and\nbasketball, all-conference volleyball and basketball, Cornhusker Girls State\ndelegate.\n\nActivities: National Honor Society, FFA, volleyball, basketball, track, one-\nact play, speech, Quiz Bowl, student council, band, choir, 4-H, Nebraska Farm\nBureau ag crew.\n\nCommunity and volunteer service: Red Cross blood drive, blood donor, Elsie\nUnited Methodist Church youth group, Wallace Youth Club, 4-H Council, Feed the\nFarmer, trash pickup, Wallace vacation Bible school, Elsie vacation Bible\nschool, Elsie United Methodist Church advisory committee, Partner Up Rodeo,\nsummer reading program.\n\nMost influential teacher: Christy Sheets, Wallace High School.\n\n\"Mrs. Sheets has been my most influential teacher throughout junior high and\nhigh school because she has always encouraged me to push myself to my fullest\npotential.

Mrs. Sheets has not only given me\nopportunities to learn in the classroom but has also taught me many life\nlessons along the way. She is the first person to give an encouraging word of\nadvice. Mrs. Sheets is supportive of all of my life endeavors and I would not\nhave had an as successful time in high school if it were not for her.\"\n\nTrevor Ross\n\nCallaway High School\n\nTrevor is the son of Rodney and Mary Ross of Callaway.

My math teacher helped\nto instill in me a concept that took some time for me to understand, but that\nis that we learn from the mistakes that we make. This is true in education and\nlife as well. Because of this, I don't worry so much about making mistakes,\nbut instead I concentrate on learning. This concept has helped me to have\nacademic success in school. As far as community achievement, growing up in\nEustis and being active in many different organizations, has given me a sense\nof great pride in my small town. I know that in order for communities to\nsurvive and thrive it takes people to volunteer their time and talents.

He saw the potential in me\nwhen I was that young and supported me throughout my math journey. He saw that\nI was not being challenged in math and decided to take it upon himself to\nchallenge me. He gave me the eighth grade math book and told me to work\nthrough it. Throughout my seventh grade year I worked through the eighth grade\nmath book so that I could learn Algebra 1 in my eighth grade year. Mr. Kemling\nknew it was controversial to allow me to work at my own speed because our\nprincipal was not very supportive. Even though the principal disliked what he\ndid, he still allowed me to move on to Algebra 1. That allowed me to grow\nimmensely in math. He supported me so much and I will always be thankful for\nhis influence on my life.\"",

She plans to study elementary education at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1183169052\">University of Nebraska at Kearney</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Goals: I plan to return to my hometown and find an open teaching position in one of the four elementary schools. After teaching for a few years, I plan to return to college and work toward a master's and doctorate. I hope to obtain my degrees within a six-year range to potentially work for the school administration. My ultimate goal is to become a superintendent. Through the course of these instances, I plan to assist my parents to pay off the mortgage of our current home to ease their strain of work as they grow older, all while saving for my own home. This will allow me to further give back to my parents, future family and community.</p>\n\n<p>In her own words: \"My mother and father were both born in a rural area of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/mx.za\">Zacatecas, Mexico</location>. Both their lives were dominated by the poverty that was in their region. Consequently, my parents were forced to discontinue their education. As their child, I am often told of the endless stories and hardships my mother and father had to face to be in the country.

Upon graduation, I plan to attend medical school either at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0728728400\">University of Nebraska Medical Center</org> or Creighton. My career goal is to become an obstetrician. I would also like to specialize in diabetic patients. I have a passion for helping people, and I would love to help bring life into the world.

If being an obstetrician isn't in my future, my second option is to be a dermatologist. This option appeals to me because I wouldn't have to be on call, and if I have a family, it would be easier to balance work and home life. Upon obtaining a doctorate degree, I plan to move back west in the Kearney or <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ne.graand\">Grand Island</location> area to practice.
