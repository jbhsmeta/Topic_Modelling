They also have enough ties to fill a department store\nat this point, and how may grilling tools does the average man actually need\nto cook a burger? This year, let's show dad how much we care by giving him\nsomething he actually wants, instead of another useless gift that will gather\ndust.\n\nKindle Paperwhite E-Reader\n\nA Kindle makes reading so much easier for dads who travel frequently. The\nclassic Paperwhite has the look of a regular paperback (so it won't scare off\nthe technology reluctant), but the convenience of keeping all his books\norganized in once place. The no glare screen and long battery life are huge\npluses, too.\n\nGourmet Grilled Cheese Crate\n\nIf he's up for the challenge to make the ultimate grilled cheese, then you\nhave to make sure he's prepared with sauces, a cook book and a grilled cheese\nbasket. Enter to win one in our Ultimate Dad Joke Contest! There are plenty of\nother options for dad at Man Crates such as a Wing Master Crate and Micro\nBrewed Kit.\n\nWireless Earbuds\n\nKnow someone who loves to work out? Wireless headphones are kind of a godsend\nfor those that hate being tethered to a cord. (Anyone else had their ears\nyanked a million times? Just us?) These bluetooth earbuds are compatible with\npretty much any smartphone and feature amazing sound quality, according to\nreviews.\n\nLodge Cast Iron Skillet\n\nCast iron is a game changer when it comes to cooking everything from meat to\npan pizza. This one is pre-seasoned, making it ready to use out of the box.\nEvery at-home chef needs one in his arsenal.\n\nColeman Instant Cabin\n\nWhether he's a seasoned explorer or his idea of being adventurous is drinking\nexpired milk, this tent is seriously cool. The Instant Cabin supposedly sets\nup in just 60 seconds and the welded floors keep the tent weather-proofed.\nThis just might inspire your guy to take you on that cross-country trip you've\nalways dreamt of. Or at least inspire a visit to a state park.\n\nHerschel Supply Co. RFID Wallet\n\nIt's time to get them a new wallet for Father's Day. He'll finally be forced\nto dump all of the expired coupons and five-year-old receipts that have been\ntaking up way too much space. We're certain he would love both the simple\nstyle and the price of this bifold, and the RFID protection keeps him safe\nfrom electronic theft.\n\nMagnetic Bottle Opener\n\nNo more bottle caps all over the place. The beer drinkers in your life could\nreally use this handy magnetic opener. It's perfect for parties, and how cute\nis that monogram? (Okay, we would probably appreciate that a lot more than our\ndads.)\n\nIgloo MaxCold Profile 54 Roller Cooler\n\nChances are, your husband hasn't purchased a new cooler since college and the\none sitting in your garage is looking pretty gross. It's time to get him an\nupgrade. This cooler is full sized and the fact that it's on wheels makes it\nsuper convenient for parties and tailgating.\n\n\\------------\n\nFollow Chicago Parent on Instagram.\n\n\\------------\n\nThis article originally published on June 11, 2018.

    "html": "<p>Repeat after me: the men in your life do not need another \"World's Best Dad\" mug in their collection. They also have enough ties to fill a department store at this point, and how may grilling tools does the average man actually need to cook a burger? This year, let's show dad how much we care by giving him something he actually wants, instead of another useless gift that will gather dust.</p>\n<p>Kindle Paperwhite E-Reader</p>\n\n<p>A Kindle makes reading so much easier for dads who travel frequently. The classic Paperwhite has the look of a regular paperback (so it won't scare off the technology reluctant), but the convenience of keeping all his books organized in once place. The no glare screen and long battery life are huge pluses, too.</p>\n\n<p>Gourmet Grilled Cheese Crate</p>\n\n<p>If he's up for the challenge to make the ultimate grilled cheese, then you have to make sure he's prepared with sauces, a cook book and a grilled cheese basket. Enter to win one in our Ultimate Dad Joke Contest! There are plenty of other options for dad at Man Crates such as a Wing <person>Master Crate</person> and Micro Brewed Kit.</p>\n\n<p>Wireless Earbuds</p>\n\n<p>Know someone who loves to work out? Wireless headphones are kind of a godsend for those that hate being tethered to a cord. (Anyone else had their ears yanked a million times? Just us?) These bluetooth earbuds are compatible with pretty much any smartphone and feature amazing sound quality, according to reviews.</p>\n\n<p>Lodge Cast Iron Skillet</p>\n\n<p>Cast iron is a game changer when it comes to cooking everything from meat to pan pizza. This one is pre-seasoned, making it ready to use out of the box. Every at-home chef needs one in his arsenal.</p>\n\n<p>Coleman Instant Cabin</p>\n\n<p>Whether he's a seasoned explorer or his idea of being adventurous is drinking expired milk, this tent is seriously cool. The Instant Cabin supposedly sets up in just 60 seconds and the welded floors keep the tent weather-proofed. This just might inspire your guy to take you on that cross-country trip you've always dreamt of. Or at least inspire a visit to a state park.</p>\n\n<p><org>Herschel Supply Co.</org> RFID Wallet</p>\n\n<p>It's time to get them a new wallet for <chron>Father's Day</chron>. He'll finally be forced to dump all of the expired coupons and five-year-old receipts that have been taking up way too much space. We're certain he would love both the simple style and the price of this bifold, and the RFID protection keeps him safe from electronic theft.</p>\n\n<p>Magnetic Bottle Opener</p>\n\n<p>No more bottle caps all over the place. The beer drinkers in your life could really use this handy magnetic opener. It's perfect for parties, and how cute is that monogram? (Okay, we would probably appreciate that a lot more than our dads.)</p>\n\n<p>Igloo MaxCold Profile 54 Roller Cooler</p>\n\n<p>Chances are, your husband hasn't purchased a new cooler since college and the one sitting in your garage is looking pretty gross. It's time to get him an upgrade. This cooler is full sized and the fact that it's on wheels makes it super convenient for parties and tailgating.</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p>Follow Chicago Parent on Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>------------</p>\n\n<p>This article originally published on <chron>June 11, 2018</chron>.
