    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Engineering\nDaily News \\-- Fresh data on technology are presented in a new report.\nAccording to news reporting originating from Qinhuangdao, People's Republic of\nChina, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Degradation state\nrecognition and failure prediction are the key steps of prognostic and health\nmanagement (PHM), which directly affect the reliability of the equipment and\nthe selection of preventive maintenance strategy. Given the problem that the\ndistinction between feature vectors is not obvious and the accuracy of fault\nprediction is low, a method based on multi-class Gaussian process\nclassification and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is studied by the\nvibration signal and flow signal in six degraded states of the axial piston\npump.\"\n\nFinancial supporters for this research include National Natural Science\nFoundation of China-Guangdong Joint Fund; National Basic Research Program of\nChina (973 Program).\n\nOur news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Yanshan University:\n\"For degradation state recognition, the variational mode decomposition (VMD)\nwas used to decompose the vibration signal, and obtaining intrinsic mode\nfunction (IMF) components with rich information. Subsequently, multi-scale\npermutation entropy (MPE) was employed to select feature vectors of IMF\ncomponents in different states. In order to reduce feature dimensions and\nimprove recognition performance, ReliefF was used to select feature vectors\nwith high weight, then a method based on multi-class Gaussian process\nclassification was established by using these feature vectors to realize the\nresearch on the degradation state recognition. The test results demonstrate\nthat the method can effectively identify the degradation state. Its\nrecognition rate reaches 98.9%. Besides, for failure prediction, through the\nanalysis of the wear process and wear mechanism of the valve plate, the curve\nfitting between the flow and the wear amount was performed by GPR to realize\nthe failure prediction of the axial piston pump.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Depending on the\nevaluation index, the GPR obtained a better failure prediction effect. The\nresults will assist in the realization of predictive maintenance, and which\nalso has significant practical value in project items.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Research on State Recognition and\nFailure Prediction of Axial Piston Pump Based on Performance Degradation Data.\n_Processes_ , 2020,8(609):609.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Engineering Daily News</org> -- Fresh data on technology are presented in a new report. According to news reporting originating from Qinhuangdao, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Degradation state recognition and failure prediction are the key steps of prognostic and health management (PHM), which directly affect the reliability of the equipment and the selection of preventive maintenance strategy. Given the problem that the distinction between feature vectors is not obvious and the accuracy of fault prediction is low, a method based on multi-class Gaussian process classification and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is studied by the vibration signal and flow signal in six degraded states of the axial piston pump.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Financial supporters for this research include <org>National Natural Science Foundation</org> of <org>China-Guangdong Joint Fund</org>; National Basic Research Program of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> (973 Program).</p>\n<p>Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from <org>Yanshan University</org>: &#8220;For degradation state recognition, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) was used to decompose the vibration signal, and obtaining intrinsic mode function (IMF) components with rich information. Subsequently, multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE) was employed to select feature vectors of <org>IMF</org> components in different states. In order to reduce feature dimensions and improve recognition performance, ReliefF was used to select feature vectors with high weight, then a method based on multi-class Gaussian process classification was established by using these feature vectors to realize the research on the degradation state recognition. The test results demonstrate that the method can effectively identify the degradation state. Its recognition rate reaches 98.9%. Besides, for failure prediction, through the analysis of the wear process and wear mechanism of the valve plate, the curve fitting between the flow and the wear amount was performed by GPR to realize the failure prediction of the axial piston pump.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Depending on the evaluation index, the GPR obtained a better failure prediction effect. The results will assist in the realization of predictive maintenance, and which also has significant practical value in project items.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Research on State Recognition and Failure Prediction of Axial Piston Pump Based on Performance Degradation Data. <em>Processes</em>, 2020,8(609):609.
