Kim Reynolds said Friday the Memorial Day\nweekend could be the time to \"tiptoe\" out after weeks of staying home due to\nthe coronavirus, but any outings would come as the state still is seeing\nhundreds of new cases daily.\n\nReynolds said the 14-day trend of new positive cases is moving lower and other\nmetrics including hospitalization rates are lower and stable.\n\n\"There's a lot of positive things,\" she said, pointing out that although she's\nopened businesses and activities \"nothing is a mandate. People have to be\npersonally responsible. If they feel comfortable to go out and tiptoe into it,\ntake your face covering if you can't social distance.\"\n\nDespite the optimism, the number of virus deaths has been relatively\nconsistent, with 18 Friday, 19 Thursday and 14 Wednesday. The total stood\nFriday at 418 deaths.\n\nReynolds again noted the overwhelming majority of deaths are among older\nadults or people with other illnesses.\n\nShe said 57% of deaths are tied to long-term care facilities.\n\nReynolds said she's ended a modified 10-day quarantine she began after\nvisiting the White House and meeting with Vice President Mike Pence in Iowa.\nStaffers of both the president and vice president had tested positive for the\ncoronavirus.",

People have to be personally responsible. If they feel comfortable to go out and tiptoe into it, take your face covering if you can't social distance.\"</p>\n<p>Despite the optimism, the number of virus deaths has been relatively consistent, with 18 Friday, 19 Thursday and 14 Wednesday. The total stood Friday at 418 deaths.</p>\n<p>Reynolds again noted the overwhelming majority of deaths are among older adults or people with other illnesses.</p>\n<p>She said 57% of deaths are tied to long-term care facilities.</p>\n<p>Reynolds said she's ended a modified 10-day quarantine she began after visiting the <org>White House</org> and meeting with Vice President <person>Mike Pence</person> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location>. Staffers of both the president and vice president had tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>",
