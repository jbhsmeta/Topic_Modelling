The state\nalso reports that in the last 14 days, 5,310 new cases have been confirmed.\n\nThose numbers have increased since our previous update, as the state of\nAlabama reported 18,776 patients were confirmed to have the coronavirus as of\nlast night.\n\nThe current number of Alabamians who have been hospitalized for treatment of\ncoronavirus, to date, is 1,949.\n\nIn Lee County, there are 563 residents who have tested positive for the virus.\nIn Chambers County there are 363 cases reported by the ADPH. Currently, there\nare 187 cases in Russell County, and 183 positive cases in Barbour County.\n\nThe live tracker managed by the state showing COVID-19 data is currently\nupdating once a day at 10 a.m. due to what the state describes as a \"large\nincrease in volume of COVID-19 laboratory results being processed.\" They hope\nto move to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. updates going forward.\n\nA statement on the COVID-19 Dashboard for Alabama reads:\n\nDue to the large increase in volume of COVID-19 laboratory results being\nprocessed by laboratories (state public health labs, commercial labs, hospital\nlabs, etc.) and sent to state health departments, the national surveillance\npipeline is becoming overwhelmed and is causing delays. This has impacted the\ndata that is displayed on this dashboard. We are now updating our dashboard\nonce a day at 10 a.m. We hope to update it at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. once this is\nresolved. Please be patient as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH), and its vendor work to\naddress these growing pains. Thank you!\n\nThe state is reporting 11,395 presumed recoveries on the ADPH tracking site.\nThe presumed recovery numbers will be updated by the ADPH weekly.\n\n**Note, all counties in the WRBL viewing area contribute to the count of local\ncases in Alabama.",
