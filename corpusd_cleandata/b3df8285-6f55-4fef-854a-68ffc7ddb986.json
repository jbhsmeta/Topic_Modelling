    "text": "As the nation continues to grapple with the spread of the novel Coronavirus,\nwe at DAV have made many adjustments to continue serving the veterans and\nfamilies who rely on our programs and services.\n\nThis pandemic has upended virtually every aspect of our lives, and especially\nfor those who are disabled and possibly more vulnerable to the disease, It is\na time of great uncertainty and concern. Please know that DAV remains here for\nyou, and I ask that you do your best to remain there for each other.\n\nYou can read more about DAV's response to the COVID-19 outbreak on Page 30 and\nstay up to date online at [dav.org/covid](http://dav.org/covid), but I'd also\nlike to draw attention to an issue that many within our community are facing,\nand that may be proving especially difficult to cope with at this time--\nchronic pain.\n\nThere are more than 4 million service-connected disabled veterans in the\nnation, and there are likely many more out there who have never sought help\nfor their injuries or illness. We each experience pain and discomfort in our\nown way, and within the scope of our own diagnoses. Our own body makeup, our\nexperiences and traumas all comprise a very unique set of factors that\ndetermine what types of treatment we will best respond to.\n\nThe VA has been In the business of treating veterans for decades, and pain\nmanagement has undergone a continual evolution as new methods and approaches\nhave entered the scene.\n\nWe know that there are many proponents for things like medical cannabis within\nthe veteran community, and other so-called \"street drugs\" have also shown\npromise treating certain conditions (read more on Page 18).\n\nComplimentary approaches to pain management and healing give veterans\nsomething else to lean on while those treatments undergo clinical trials--and\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs offers a host of different methods from\nmassage and acupuncture to yoga and adaptive sports (see Page 22).\n\nWhat works for me may not work for you, and vice versa. But many veterans have\nseen success by changing how they experience and treat their conditions, and\nare reporting happier, more fulfilled lives as a result. It worth exploring\nthese methods and taking advantage of all that the VA offers as you seek to\nheal your body and mind.\n\nFrom the NATIONAL ADJUTANT J. MARC BURGESS",

Please know\nthat DAV remains here for you, and I ask that you do your best to remain\nthere for each other.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about DAV's response to the COVID-19\noutbreak on Page 30 and stay up to date online at <a href=\"http://dav.org/covid\">dav.org/covid</a>, but\nI'd also like to draw attention to an issue that many within our\ncommunity are facing, and that may be proving especially difficult to\ncope with at this time--chronic pain.</p>\n\n<p>There are more than 4 million service-connected disabled veterans\nin the nation, and there are likely many more out there who have never\nsought help for their injuries or illness. We each experience pain and\ndiscomfort in our own way, and within the scope of our own diagnoses.\nOur own body makeup, our experiences and traumas all comprise a very\nunique set of factors that determine what types of treatment we will\nbest respond to.</p>\n\n<p>The <org>VA</org> has been In the business of treating veterans for decades,\nand pain management has undergone a continual evolution as new methods\nand approaches have entered the scene.</p>\n\n<p>We know that there are many proponents for things like medical\ncannabis within the veteran community, and other so-called \"street\ndrugs\" have also shown promise treating certain conditions (read\nmore on Page 18).</p>\n\n<p>Complimentary approaches to pain management and healing give\nveterans something else to lean on while those treatments undergo\nclinical trials--and the <org>Department of Veterans Affairs</org> offers a host of\ndifferent methods from massage and acupuncture to yoga and adaptive\nsports (see Page 22).</p>\n\n<p>What works for me may not work for you, and vice versa. But many\nveterans have seen success by changing how they experience and treat\ntheir conditions, and are reporting happier, more fulfilled lives as a\nresult. It worth exploring these methods and taking advantage of all\nthat the <org>VA</org> offers as you seek to heal your body and mind.</p>\n\n<p>From the NATIONAL ADJUTANT <person>J. MARC BURGESS</person></p>",
