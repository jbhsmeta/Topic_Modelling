    "text": "*> DENVER \\- From a base in producing both original music and remixes a decade ago, Canadian electronic music duo Zeds Dead branched out to explore a vast range of genres including U.K. garage, electro house, hip hop, drum and bass and more.\n\nNow a staple on the international touring circuit, such diversity poses many\nchallenges for the lighting team, led by production designer Erik Mahowald (of\nBending Lite Productions).\n\nRecently they have been headlining package tours for their record label\nDeadbeats, a series of one-off shows in a varied combination of festival stage\ntakeovers and standard concert venue applications at venues ranging from\n5,000-50,000 capacities. This demand on scalability, and the random nature of\nthe shows, creates further challenges for Mahowald. But GLP fixtures provided\nthe necessary versatility.\n\n\"The design was originally debuted at Red Rocks Amphitheater [near Denver]\nwhich consisted of 50 GLP JDC1 fixtures, while GLP impression FR10 Bars were\nintroduced very recently at our Aragon Ballroom [Chicago] and Masonic Temple\n[Detroit] shows,\" he said. Lighting inventory for both these shows was\nprovided by Chicago-based LEC (LIVE Entertainment Chicago).\n\nBending Lite has been working with Zeds Dead since 2017, and have created two\nproduction designs for Deadbeats shows. \"This is our first tour with them, and\nwe also handle all programming,\" Mahowald said, citing Davis Alexander as the\nprogrammer.\n\nBending Lite was first introduced to Zeds Dead by production manager Daniel\nOstroff, who asked them to assist on larger production applications such as\ntheir major headline shows.\n\n\"For the Deadbeats shows, we had one request - they didn't want one big\nupstage wall, but rather four vertical stripes,\" Mahowald said. \"From that, we\nmoulded something that would look bold, powerful, and clean, with lots of defi\nnitive straight lines that would create architecture. The two DJs stand on an\nelevated platform upstage of the tiered deck trussing, creating a massive\nplatform.\"\n\nWanting to fabricate a rig that would fit the full width of venues, mirrored\nflown and deck trussing was designed to create a picture frame aesthetic. This\nversatile set fits the vast library of music, and also underscores the\nimportance of having flexible fixtures in the rig.\n\nEach of the four identical trusses included six FR10s and eight JDCIs, with\nthe flown rig mirrored to the deck to create maximum beam power. \"The music\nvaries greatly night to night, and having versatile fixtures like this is\nsomething we count on,\" Erik Mahowald said.\n\n\"We used each of these units to their fullest capacity and most extended\nmodes, and we appreciate their ability to create what seems to be an infinite\nnumber of looks.\"",

    "title": "LDs for Zeds Dead \"Deadbeats\" Shows Skilled at Scaling Up the Looks",
    "html": "<p>*&gt; <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">DENVER</location> - From a base in producing both original music and remixes a decade ago, Canadian electronic music duo Zeds Dead branched out to explore a vast range of genres including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">U.K.</location> garage, electro house, hip hop, drum and bass and more.</p>\n<p>Now a staple on the international touring circuit, such diversity poses many challenges for the lighting team, led by production designer <person>Erik Mahowald</person> (of <org>Bending Lite Productions</org>).</p>\n<p>Recently they have been headlining package tours for their record label Deadbeats, a series of one-off shows in a varied combination of festival stage takeovers and standard concert venue applications at venues ranging from 5,000-50,000 capacities. This demand on scalability, and the random nature of the shows, creates further challenges for Mahowald. But GLP fixtures provided the necessary versatility.</p>\n<p>\"The design was originally debuted at <location>Red Rocks Amphitheater</location> [near <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>] which consisted of 50 GLP JDC1 fixtures, while GLP impression FR10 Bars were introduced very recently at our <location>Aragon Ballroom</location> [<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>] and <org>Masonic Temple</org> [<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.detrit\">Detroit</location>] shows,\" he said. Lighting inventory for both these shows was provided by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>-based LEC (LIVE Entertainment Chicago).</p>\n<p>Bending Lite has been working with Zeds Dead since 2017, and have created two production designs for Deadbeats shows. \"This is our first tour with them, and we also handle all programming,\" Mahowald said, citing <person>Davis Alexander</person> as the programmer.</p>\n<p>Bending Lite was first introduced to Zeds Dead by production manager <person>Daniel Ostroff</person>, who asked them to assist on larger production applications such as their major headline shows.</p>\n<p>\"For the Deadbeats shows, we had one request - they didn't want one big upstage wall, but rather four vertical stripes,\" Mahowald said. \"From that, we moulded something that would look bold, powerful, and clean, with lots of defi nitive straight lines that would create architecture. The two DJs stand on an elevated platform upstage of the tiered deck trussing, creating a massive platform.\"</p>\n<p>Wanting to fabricate a rig that would fit the full width of venues, mirrored flown and deck trussing was designed to create a picture frame aesthetic. This versatile set fits the vast library of music, and also underscores the importance of having flexible fixtures in the rig.</p>\n<p>Each of the four identical trusses included six FR10s and eight JDCIs, with the flown rig mirrored to the deck to create maximum beam power. \"The music varies greatly night to night, and having versatile fixtures like this is something we count on,\" <person>Erik Mahowald</person> said.</p>\n<p>\"We used each of these units to their fullest capacity and most extended modes, and we appreciate their ability to create what seems to be an infinite number of looks.\"</p>",
