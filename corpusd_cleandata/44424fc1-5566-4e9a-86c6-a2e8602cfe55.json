    "text": "Annapolis: Office of the Attorney General, The State of Maryland has issued\nthe following news release:\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh joined a multistate coalition of 23\nattorneys general in supporting legal action taken against the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n(HHS) for increasing the risk that women nationwide will contract COVID-19 as\nthey seek abortions in their state. In an amicus brief filed in support of the\nplaintiffs in American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. v.\nFDA et al., the coalition supports the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary\ninjunction to halt an FDA requirement that forces women to appear in person in\na clinical setting to receive a drug known as Mifepristone for an early\nabortion or for miscarriage care. The coalition argues that the drug should be\nreadily accessible via telehealth, so as to not potentially expose women to\nCOVID-19 by requiring unnecessary travel to obtain it. The brief was filed in\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\n\n\"Requiring women patients to appear in person to access legal medical services\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic is harmful to women, their families, and the\npublic in general,\" said Attorney General Frosh. \"Telehealth is not only\nacceptable for the purpose of prescribing this medication, but encouraged by\nfederal and state guidance on preventing the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nSince the widespread onset of COVID-19 across the United States in March,\nnearly 1.9 million Americans have contracted the disease, resulting in more\nthan 107,000 deaths, including more than 56,700 infections and more than 2,500\ndeaths in Maryland. In response, legislators, officials, and agencies across\nthe nation have been instituting various emergency measures to slow the spread\nof the virus by limiting face-to-face contact and reducing in-person social\ngatherings, such as by closing schools and requiring nonessential employees to\nwork from home, as limiting interpersonal contact is central to the ability to\ncontrol the spread of the virus.\n\nBut the FDA's current policy requiring patients to appear in person in a\nclinical setting to receive Mifepristone heightens the risk of contracting and\ntransmitting COVID-19 for everyone involved--including patients and health\ncare providers. Forcing women to travel at a time when many states and the\nfederal government are urging people to stay home to curb the spread of\nCOVID-19 is shortsighted, and puts not only women and their close contacts\nacross the country in harm's way, but also the public health more generally.\nFurther, this policy undermines different states' ability to effectively\nmanage the pandemic.\n\nIn the brief, the coalition specifically argues that \"many women will need to\ntravel long distances in order to reach a clinic that dispenses Mifepristone--\nsometimes up to two-hundred miles--especially if they reside in rural and\nmedically underserved locations.\" Additionally, those women in more compact,\nurban cities may not have the option to practice social distancing outside the\nhome, therefore increasing the likelihood of coming into contact with an\nindividual who has contracted COVID-19. But \"[b]y using measures like\ntelehealth to reduce unnecessary person-to-person contacts, [states] can\ndecrease their infection rate, as required to safely commence reopening even\nas the pandemic continues.\" In fact, the coalition continues, \"telehealth\nshould be used wherever possible--even as phased reopening of the States\noccur[s]--because it 'maximize[s] the number of capable health care workers'\nproviding necessary medical treatment, while protecting health care staff,\"\nand \"the counseling required prior to a medication abortion is routinely\nprovided through telehealth in order to reduce in-clinic interactions.\"\n\nAnother division of HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nhave both advocated for telehealth, stating, \"[l]everaging telemedicine\nwhenever possible is the best way to protect patients and staff from\nCOVID-19.\"\n\nThe coalition goes on to highlight that their states have already taken\nnumerous steps to expand the use of telehealth during the current public\nhealth crisis, including the suspension \"of existing statutes and regulations\nthat limit the use of telehealth in order to allow the delivery of regulated\nservices through telehealth to additional patient populations, including\nespecially vulnerable ones. These suspension orders expand the types of\npractitioners who can use telehealth, the settings in which it can be\nprovided, the modalities that can be used to deliver telehealth services, and\nthe circumstances under which telehealth can be initiated.\" Further, many\nstates have also suspended existing rules that prohibit telehealth in the\nabsence of an existing patient-provider relationship so that patients can\nreceive care from new providers.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has likewise\nchampioned telehealth as an effective substitute for in-clinic dispensing of\nMifepristone that can improve patient safety and outcomes during the COVID-19\npublic health crisis. Even before the pandemic, the American Medical\nAssociation passed a resolution in 2018 urging the FDA to lift the requirement\nbecause it \"impedes the provision of\" Mifepristone and has no \"demonstrated or\neven reasonably likely advantage.\"\n\nIn March, a coalition including Attorney General Frosh called on the Trump\nadministration to waive or utilize its discretion not to enforce this\nMifepristone requirement because it dictates and subsequently impedes women's\naccess to a medication abortion. The coalition stressed the states' need to\nensure that women across the country have access to critical health care,\nincluding access to abortion services, without forcing them to travel and risk\nthe spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2000, the prescription drug Mifepristone, sometimes referred to as RU-486,\nbecame the first FDA-approved medication to induce medication abortions, and\ntoday still remains the only drug approved in the United States for pregnancy\ntermination. Since its approval, three-million women in the United States have\nused the medication, which entails women taking Mifepristone along with\nanother drug to bring about an abortion. According to the FDA, this medication\n\"has been increasingly used as its efficacy and safety have become well-\nestablished by both research and experience.\" Women alternatively may undergo\na procedural abortion that is performed by aspiration or by dilation and\nevacuation.\n\nJoining Attorney General Frosh in filing the brief are the attorneys general\nof California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia,\nHawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New\nJersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode\nIsland, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.annpls\">Annapolis</location>: <org>Office of the Attorney General</org>, The <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">State of Maryland</location>\nhas issued the following news release:</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location> Attorney General <person>Brian E. Frosh</person> joined a multistate\ncoalition of 23 attorneys general in supporting legal action taken\nagainst the <org>Food and Drug Administration</org> (FDA) and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3892504298\">U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services</org> (HHS) for increasing the risk that women\nnationwide will contract COVID-19 as they seek abortions in their state.\nIn an amicus brief filed in support of the plaintiffs in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3334464434\">American\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</org> et al. v. FDA et al., the\ncoalition supports the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary\ninjunction to halt an FDA requirement that forces women to appear in\nperson in a clinical setting to receive a drug known as Mifepristone for\nan early abortion or for miscarriage care. The coalition argues that the\ndrug should be readily accessible via telehealth, so as to not\npotentially expose women to COVID-19 by requiring unnecessary travel to\nobtain it. The brief was filed in the <org>U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Maryland</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Requiring women patients to appear in person to access legal\nmedical services during the COVID-19 pandemic is harmful to women, their\nfamilies, and the public in general,\" said Attorney General Frosh.\n\"Telehealth is not only acceptable for the purpose of prescribing\nthis medication, but encouraged by federal and state guidance on\npreventing the spread of COVID-19.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since the widespread onset of COVID-19 across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> in\nMarch, nearly 1.9 million Americans have contracted the disease,\nresulting in more than 107,000 deaths, including more than 56,700\ninfections and more than 2,500 deaths in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.md\">Maryland</location>. In response,\nlegislators, officials, and agencies across the nation have been\ninstituting various emergency measures to slow the spread of the virus\nby limiting face-to-face contact and reducing in-person social\ngatherings, such as by closing schools and requiring nonessential\nemployees to work from home, as limiting interpersonal contact is\ncentral to the ability to control the spread of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>But the <org>FDA's</org> current policy requiring patients to appear in\nperson in a clinical setting to receive Mifepristone heightens the risk\nof contracting and transmitting COVID-19 for everyone\ninvolved--including patients and health care providers. Forcing women to\ntravel at a time when many states and the federal government are urging\npeople to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19 is shortsighted, and\nputs not only women and their close contacts across the country in\nharm's way, but also the public health more generally. Further,\nthis policy undermines different states' ability to effectively\nmanage the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>In the brief, the coalition specifically argues that \"many\nwomen will need to travel long distances in order to reach a clinic that\ndispenses Mifepristone--sometimes up to two-hundred miles--especially if\nthey reside in rural and medically underserved locations.\"\nAdditionally, those women in more compact, urban cities may not have the\noption to practice social distancing outside the home, therefore\nincreasing the likelihood of coming into contact with an individual who\nhas contracted COVID-19. But \"[b]y using measures like telehealth\nto reduce unnecessary person-to-person contacts, [states] can decrease\ntheir infection rate, as required to safely commence reopening even as\nthe pandemic continues.\" In fact, the coalition continues,\n\"telehealth should be used wherever possible--even as phased\nreopening of the States occur[s]--because it 'maximize[s] the\nnumber of capable health care workers' providing necessary medical\ntreatment, while protecting health care staff,\" and \"the\ncounseling required prior to a medication abortion is routinely provided\nthrough telehealth in order to reduce in-clinic interactions.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another division of HHS and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention</org> have both advocated for telehealth, stating,\n\"[l]everaging telemedicine whenever possible is the best way to\nprotect patients and staff from COVID-19.\"</p>\n\n<p>The coalition goes on to highlight that their states have already\ntaken numerous steps to expand the use of telehealth during the current\npublic health crisis, including the suspension \"of existing\nstatutes and regulations that limit the use of telehealth in order to\nallow the delivery of regulated services through telehealth to\nadditional patient populations, including especially vulnerable ones.\nThese suspension orders expand the types of practitioners who can use\ntelehealth, the settings in which it can be provided, the modalities\nthat can be used to deliver telehealth services, and the circumstances\nunder which telehealth can be initiated.\" Further, many states have\nalso suspended existing rules that prohibit telehealth in the absence of\nan existing patient-provider relationship so that patients can receive\ncare from new providers.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3334464434\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</org> has\nlikewise championed telehealth as an effective substitute for in-clinic\ndispensing of Mifepristone that can improve patient safety and outcomes\nduring the COVID-19 public health crisis. Even before the pandemic, the\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3014283382\">American Medical Association</org> passed a resolution in 2018 urging the FDA\nto lift the requirement because it \"impedes the provision of\"\nMifepristone and has no \"demonstrated or even reasonably likely\nadvantage.\"</p>\n\n<p>In March, a coalition including Attorney General Frosh called on\nthe Trump administration to waive or utilize its discretion not to\nenforce this Mifepristone requirement because it dictates and\nsubsequently impedes women's access to a medication abortion. The\ncoalition stressed the states' need to ensure that women across the\ncountry have access to critical health care, including access to\nabortion services, without forcing them to travel and risk the spread of\nCOVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>In 2000, the prescription drug Mifepristone, sometimes referred to\nas RU-486, became the first FDA-approved medication to induce medication\nabortions, and today still remains the only drug approved in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United\nStates</location> for pregnancy termination. Since its approval, three-million\nwomen in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> have used the medication, which entails women\ntaking Mifepristone along with another drug to bring about an abortion.\nAccording to the FDA, this medication \"has been increasingly used\nas its efficacy and safety have become well-established by both research\nand experience.\" Women alternatively may undergo a procedural\nabortion that is performed by aspiration or by dilation and evacuation.</p>\n\n<p>Joining Attorney General Frosh in filing the brief are the\nattorneys general of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ct\">Connecticut</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.de\">Delaware</location>, the\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.dc\">District of Columbia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.hi\">Hawaii</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.il\">Illinois</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.me\">Maine</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ma\">Massachusetts</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mi\">Michigan</location>,\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nv\">Nevada</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nm\">New Mexico</location>, New <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.york\">York, North Carolina</location>,\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.oregon\">Oregon, Pennsylvania</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ri\">Rhode Island</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.vt\">Vermont</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wa\">Washington</location>.</p>",
