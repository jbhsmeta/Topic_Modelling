Meanwhile, sales of\n'flu veils' surged, presaging today's trend of PPE-inspired accessories.\"\n\n\"It had been fashionable to wear veils during the Victorian period and the\nEdwardian era. The very large hats were often secured to the head with veils.\nBut they had gone out when the bigger hats started to shrink down and\nparticularly during WWI,\" Kevin Jones told WWD.\n\n\"The generation that lived through the Spanish flu had come out of veiling,\"\nKevin added, \"but picked it up again...it became a perfect excuse to also be\nable to cover your face.\"",

Stores shut their doors, limited hours and crowd capacity, and\ndiscouraged exchanges and returns in order to limit transmission.</p>\n\n<p>\"Through the fall of 1918, sales of blankets, comforters and\nwinter underwear (a precursor to today's stay-at-home athleisure?)\nwere up,\" writes WWD, \"while sales of ready-to-wear and\nchildren's wear were hard hit. Meanwhile, sales of 'flu\nveils' surged, presaging today's trend of PPE-inspired\naccessories.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It had been fashionable to wear veils during the Victorian\nperiod and the Edwardian era. The very large hats were often secured to\nthe head with veils. But they had gone out when the bigger hats started\nto shrink down and particularly during WWI,\" <person>Kevin Jones</person> told WWD.</p>\n\n<p>\"The generation that lived through the Spanish flu had come\nout of veiling,\" Kevin added, \"but picked it up again...it\nbecame a perfect excuse to also be able to cover your face.\"</p>",
