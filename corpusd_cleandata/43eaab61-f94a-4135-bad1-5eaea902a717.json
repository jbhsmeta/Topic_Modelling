    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Women's\nHealth Daily \\-- A new study on Oncology - Ovarian Cancer is now available.\nAccording to news reporting originating from Athens, Greece, by NewsRx\ncorrespondents, research stated, \"Ovarian cancer has the worst survival rate\nbecause it is typically diagnosed at advanced stage. Despite treatment, the\ndisease commonly recurs due to chemo-resistance.\"\n\nOur news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of\nAthens, \"Liquid biopsy, based on minimally invasive blood tests, has the\nadvantage of following tumor evolution in real time, offering novel insights\non cancer prevention and treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs),\ncirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating cell-free microRNAs (cfmiRNAs) and\ncirculating exosomes represent the major components of liquid biopsy. In this\nchapter, we provide an overview of recent research on CTCs, ctDNA, cfmiRNAs\nand exosomes in ovarian cancer.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We also focus on the\nclinical value of liquid biopsy in early diagnosis, prognosis, treatment\nresponse, as well as screening in the general population.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Liquid biopsy in ovarian cancer.\n_Advances In Clinical Chemistry_ , 2020;97():13-71.\n\nThe news editors report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting L. Giannopoulou, Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells Lab,\nLaboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Dept. of Chemistry, University of Athens,\nUniversity Campus, Athens, Greece.\n\nThe direct object identifier (DOI) for that additional information is:\n<https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.acc.2020.01.001>. This DOI is a link to an online\nelectronic document that is either free or for purchase, and can be your\ndirect source for a journal article and its citation.\n\n(Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around\nthe world.)",

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at NewsRx Women&#8217;s <org>Health Daily</org> -- A new study on Oncology - Ovarian Cancer is now available. According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gr..athens\">Athens, Greece</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Ovarian cancer has the worst survival rate because it is typically diagnosed at advanced stage. Despite treatment, the disease commonly recurs due to chemo-resistance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the <org>University of Athens</org>, &#8220;Liquid biopsy, based on minimally invasive blood tests, has the advantage of following tumor evolution in real time, offering novel insights on cancer prevention and treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating cell-free microRNAs (cfmiRNAs) and circulating exosomes represent the major components of liquid biopsy. In this chapter, we provide an overview of recent research on CTCs, ctDNA, cfmiRNAs and exosomes in ovarian cancer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;We also focus on the clinical value of liquid biopsy in early diagnosis, prognosis, treatment response, as well as screening in the general population.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Liquid biopsy in ovarian cancer. <em>Advances In Clinical Chemistry</em>, 2020;97():13-71.</p>\n<p>The news editors report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>L.
