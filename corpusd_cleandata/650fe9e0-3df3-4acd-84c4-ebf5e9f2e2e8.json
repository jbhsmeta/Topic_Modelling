    "text": "TRENTON, N.J. \\- Good Samaritans carrying brooms, dustpans and shop vacuums\njoined hired crews Monday in New Jersey's capital to clear broken glass and\nother debris after vandalism and looting followed protests of the Minneapolis\ndeath of George Floyd.\n\nA similar effort took place in Atlantic City, where young people from a church\nhelped clear a shopping district that saw smashed windows and looting.\n\nChris DeLeon, 34, of Trenton, carried a push broom and said he arrived at 8\na.m. with dozens of other people to sweep up broken glass.\n\nAt least three banks downtown, along with other business, had windows smashed.\nDeLeon said he attended the protest and saw live videos showing the vandalism\nafter he left. He decided to come back to help clean.\n\n\"It just goes to show there's at least as many good people as there are other\nfolks out there,\" he said.\n\nAtlantic City Mayor Marty Small apologized to businesses for vandalism and\nlooting that affected more than 20 businesses Sunday, most of them in The\nWalk, a shopping district.\n\nSeventeen people were arrested in connection with the looting, the mayor said,\nand six were Atlantic City residents.\n\nSmall imposed a 7 p.m. curfew for the coming week. Trenton also has a 7 p.m.\ncurfew, which lifts at 6 a.m.\n\nThe violence is unacceptable, Small said.\n\n\"You can't go anyplace else and do that,\" he said. \"You can't go anywhere else\nand have people accept that.\"\n\nTeenagers from a church were among those helping clean up vandalism, Atlantic\nCity Councilman Kaleem Shabazz said.\n\nTrenton Mayor Reed Gusciora toured the West State Street business corridor\nMonday morning and said police determined some of the vandals were from out of\ntown. But he also called on young people in Trenton to take responsibility.\n\n\"This is definitely a step backward,\" he said. \"Yesterday was also peaceful\nfor the most part. A productive dialog took place, but then once it turned\ndark, things go ugly. We had agitators from out of town who should have stayed\nout of town, and unfortunately we have a lot of youth from Trenton that have\nto take ownership of the damage downtown.\"\n\nNo injuries were reported in the disturbances Sunday night in Atlantic City\nand Trenton.\n\nFloyd, a Black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died May 25 after a white\nMinneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed on his neck even after he had\nstopped breathing. Protests have rocked U.S. communities ever since, with\nnightfall discontinuing peaceful activity.",

DeLeon said he attended the protest and saw live videos showing the vandalism after he left. He decided to come back to help clean.</p>\n\n<p>\"It just goes to show there's at least as many good people as there are other folks out there,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.atlity\">Atlantic City</location> Mayor <person>Marty Small</person> apologized to businesses for vandalism and looting that affected more than 20 businesses Sunday, most of them in The Walk, a shopping district.</p>\n\n<p>Seventeen people were arrested in connection with the looting, the mayor said, and six were <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.atlity\">Atlantic City</location> residents.</p>\n\n<p>Small imposed a <chron>7 p.m.</chron> curfew for the coming week. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location> also has a <chron>7 p.m.</chron> curfew, which lifts at <chron>6 a.m.</chron></p>\n\n<p>The violence is unacceptable, Small said.</p>\n\n<p>\"You can't go anyplace else and do that,\" he said. \"You can't go anywhere else and have people accept that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Teenagers from a church were among those helping clean up vandalism, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.atlity\">Atlantic City</location> Councilman <person>Kaleem Shabazz</person> said.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location> Mayor <person>Reed Gusciora</person> toured the <location>West State Street</location> business corridor Monday morning and said police determined some of the vandals were from out of town. But he also called on young people in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location> to take responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is definitely a step backward,\" he said. \"Yesterday was also peaceful for the most part. A productive dialog took place, but then once it turned dark, things go ugly. We had agitators from out of town who should have stayed out of town, and unfortunately we have a lot of youth from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location> that have to take ownership of the damage downtown.\"</p>\n\n<p>No injuries were reported in the disturbances Sunday night in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.atlity\">Atlantic City</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nj.trentn\">Trenton</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Floyd, a Black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died <chron>May 25</chron> after a white <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer kept a knee pressed on his neck even after he had stopped breathing. Protests have rocked <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> communities ever since, with nightfall discontinuing peaceful activity.</p>",
