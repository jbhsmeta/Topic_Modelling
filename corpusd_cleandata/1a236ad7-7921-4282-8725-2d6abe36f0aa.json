They are using funds to\noffer a weekly virtual bingo program reaching more than 250 residents.\n\nSacred Heart Food Pantry, serving Horicon, Juneau, Burnett and Iron Ridge,\nreceived $1,250 to purchase food and grocery gift cards for families in need.\n\nFive GWCHF partner childcare agencies are receiving $1,000 each to cover costs\nof supplies, equipment and staff training needed to ensure safety for children\nand staff as they transition through the recovery phase. Recipients, who\nregularly partner with GWCHF on early childhood education initiatives, include\nCommunity Care and Preschool in Beaver Dam, Future All Stars Academy in\nJuneau, Gingerbread Preschool and Child Care Center in Watertown, Kiddie\nKampus in Watertown, and Willows Christian Child Care Center in Iron Ridge.\n\nTo date, GWCHF has responded with approximately $71,000 in emergency grant\nfunding. Grants have provided support to ensure the health and safety of\nvulnerable residents throughout Dodge and Jefferson counties. They have funded\nemergency food, shelter, and service adaptations of agencies.\n\n\"Our initial emergency response grants focused on supporting agencies that\nwere seeing a surge in need due to the pandemic,\" said Tina Crave, GWCHF\nPresident and CEO. \"As we move from initial response into a recovery period,\nfuture grants will be used to help agencies adapt operations to serve our\ncommunity safely in the new environment. The health, economic, social and\nemotional impacts of this pandemic are far reaching, and we are eager to\nsupport community partners in innovating to lead our community's recovery.\"\n\nFor more information on grant opportunities and to learn about GWCHF and\nsupported initiatives, visit\n[www.watertownhealthfoundation.com](http://www.watertownhealthfoundation.com).",
