    "text": "We certainly don't need another problem, but there's an old one that shouldn't\nbe ignored. Skin cancer information is on the internet, but there's an\nalarming statistic that bears repeating: One out of every five Americans who\nlives to the age of 70 will have developed skin cancer that requires\ntreatment. That includes me.\n\nI don't recall hearing about sunscreen lotion until I was a teenager and\ndidn't use it then. Caps, straw hats or shade trees were my only sunscreens\nwhen I played outside or worked in the fields.\n\nThrough my middle years, I avoided the sun after skin cancer warnings became\ncommon. By retirement age, I thought I had beaten it. Later, when flakes\nappeared on my arms and ears, I stubbornly attributed them to dry skin.\n\nWhen I was 75, a small place on my left ear wouldn't heal. A visit to a\nspecialist resulted in surgery that removed part of the ear. Also, a few\nplaces on my face were treated with a laser without leaving scars.\n\nSince that time, I've had surgery on the top of my head, my lower back and\neach arm. Usually, I receive more laser treatments during quarterly checkups.\n\nMy point is, please educate yourself, your youngsters and relatives about the\ndanger of skin cancer now! Prevention and early detection can be lifesavers.\n\nActually, I've been lucky so far, but have found that coronavirus protection\nmasks aren't designed for people with an ear and a half.\n\nCurt Seymore\n\nJonesboro",

Skin cancer information is on the internet, but there's an alarming statistic that bears repeating: One out of every five Americans who lives to the age of 70 will have developed skin cancer that requires treatment. That includes me.</p>\n<p>I don't recall hearing about sunscreen lotion until I was a teenager and didn't use it then. Caps, straw hats or shade trees were my only sunscreens when I played outside or worked in the fields.</p>\n\n<p>Through my middle years, I avoided the sun after skin cancer warnings became common. By retirement age, I thought I had beaten it. Later, when flakes appeared on my arms and ears, I stubbornly attributed them to dry skin.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 75, a small place on my left ear wouldn't heal. A visit to a specialist resulted in surgery that removed part of the ear. Also, a few places on my face were treated with a laser without leaving scars.</p>\n\n<p>Since that time, I've had surgery on the top of my head, my lower back and each arm. Usually, I receive more laser treatments during quarterly checkups.</p>\n\n<p>My point is, please educate yourself, your youngsters and relatives about the danger of skin cancer now! Prevention and early detection can be lifesavers.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, I've been lucky so far, but have found that coronavirus protection masks aren't designed for people with an ear and a half.</p>\n\n<p><person>Curt Seymore</person></p>\n\n<p>Jonesboro</p>",
