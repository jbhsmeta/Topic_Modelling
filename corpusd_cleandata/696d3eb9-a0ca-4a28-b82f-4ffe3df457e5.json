Instead of listening to his own\nadvisors, Trump ignored the pandemic, allowed the virus to spread, and\ninflicted an unprecedented economic disaster on working families.\n\nHis celebration of the latest job report is an insult to the millions of\nAmericans who are out of work. It's a disgusting display while expanded\nbenefits are set to run out and Republican lawmakers are completely\nuninterested in helping working people get back on their feet.\n\nTrump can't pull the wool over voters' eyes. Virginians know we can't afford\nfour more years of his failed leadership. We saw through his empty promises in\n2016, and we're going to vote him out of office in November.\"",

Instead\nof listening to his own advisors, Trump ignored the pandemic, allowed\nthe virus to spread, and inflicted an unprecedented economic disaster on\nworking families.</p>\n\n<p>His celebration of the latest job report is an insult to the\nmillions of Americans who are out of work. It's a disgusting\ndisplay while expanded benefits are set to run out and Republican\nlawmakers are completely uninterested in helping working people get back\non their feet.</p>\n\n<p>Trump can't pull the wool over voters' eyes. Virginians\nknow we can't afford four more years of his failed leadership. We\nsaw through his empty promises in 2016, and we're going to vote him\nout of office in November.\"</p>",
