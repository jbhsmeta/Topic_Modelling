    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Hospital &\nNursing Home Daily \\-- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a\npatent application by the inventor Chia, Brian Cheng San (Singapore,\nSingapore), filed on July 2, 2018, was made available online on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee is Agency for Science \\- Technology and Research\n(Singapore, Singapore).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"In 2011, there were 80,000 cases of invasive\nMeticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in the United\nStates, resulting in 11,000 fatalities. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant\nbacteria and the lack of new antibiotics in the drug development pipelines of\npharmaceutical companies is a major health concern. Since 2000, only four\nantibiotics with new chemical scaffolds were launched; the (i) oxazolidinone\nLinezolid (2000), (ii) lipopeptide Daptomycin (2003), (iii) pleuromutilin\nRetapamulin (2007) and (iv) macrocycle Fidaxomicin (2011). Hence, there is an\nurgent need to develop new classes of antibacterials, especially those against\nemerging multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is also the\nprimary culprit responsible for human skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs).\nA study involving 11 US hospitals revealed more than 75% of SSTI cases were\ncaused by Staphylococcus aureus and close to 60% were found to involve\nMeticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Of particular concern is\nthe emergence of Mupirocin-resistant MRSA, a front-line widely-used topical\nantibiotic used for the treatment of MRSA skin infections and nasal\ndecolonization. At Singapore's Tan Tock Seng hospital, the prevalence of\nMupirocin-resistant MRSA was 11% in a 2009-2010 survey. Alarmingly, a more\nrecent 2013 survey by 7 public-sector hospitals in Singapore revealed a 31%\nincidence rate, mirroring a 2012-2013 survey at a New York City hospital. The\nhighest rate of Mupirocin resistance ever reported was 79% in 2008 in a Swiss\nhospital. With these alarming statistics, it is imperative that a Mupirocin\nsubstitute be developed as soon as possible.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor's summary information for\nthis patent application: \"Novel compounds have now been found with superior\nanti-bactericidal activities.\n\n\"In one aspect, there is provided a compound of formula (I):\n\n\"##STR00002##\n\n\"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof; wherein L.sub.1 is\n--(CH.sub.2).sub.m--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene,\nC.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or benzylene, wherein m is selected\nfrom 1 to 5; wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are independently selected from H or\nCH.sub.3, or\n\n\"R.sub.1 is selected from H or CH.sub.3 and R.sub.2 is\n\n\"##STR00003##\n\n\"wherein L.sub.2 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene,\nC.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene, C.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or\nbenzylene, wherein n is selected from 1 to 5; wherein R.sub.3-R.sub.8 are\nindependently H, Cl, I, Br or F; wherein at least one of R.sub.3-R.sub.8 is\nCl, I, Br or F; wherein R.sub.9\n\n\"##STR00004##\n\n\"wherein L.sub.3 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.o--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene,\nC.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene, C.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or\nbenzylene, wherein o is selected from 1 to 5; wherein L.sub.4 is\n--(CH.sub.2).sub.p--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene,\nC.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or benzylene, wherein p is selected\nfrom 1 to 5; wherein R.sub.10, R.sub.11 and R.sub.12 are independently H or\n--CH.sub.3.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Hospital &amp; Nursing Home Daily</org> -- From <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, D.C.</location>, NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by the inventor Chia, <person>Brian Cheng San</person> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location>), filed on <chron>July 2, 2018</chron>, was made available online on <chron>May 21, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The patent&#8217;s assignee is <org>Agency for Science</org> - Technology and Research (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location>).</p>\n<p>News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;In 2011, there were 80,000 cases of invasive Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>, resulting in 11,000 fatalities. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria and the lack of new antibiotics in the drug development pipelines of pharmaceutical companies is a major health concern. Since 2000, only four antibiotics with new chemical scaffolds were launched; the (i) oxazolidinone Linezolid (2000), (ii) lipopeptide Daptomycin (2003), (iii) pleuromutilin Retapamulin (2007) and (iv) macrocycle Fidaxomicin (2011). Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new classes of antibacterials, especially those against emerging multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is also the primary culprit responsible for human skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). A study involving 11 US hospitals revealed more than 75% of SSTI cases were caused by Staphylococcus aureus and close to 60% were found to involve Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Of particular concern is the emergence of Mupirocin-resistant MRSA, a front-line widely-used topical antibiotic used for the treatment of MRSA skin infections and nasal decolonization. At Singapore&#8217;s Tan <person>Tock Seng</person> hospital, the prevalence of Mupirocin-resistant MRSA was 11% in a 2009-2010 survey. Alarmingly, a more recent 2013 survey by 7 public-sector hospitals in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location> revealed a 31% incidence rate, mirroring a 2012-2013 survey at a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York City</location> hospital. The highest rate of Mupirocin resistance ever reported was 79% in 2008 in a Swiss hospital. With these alarming statistics, it is imperative that a Mupirocin substitute be developed as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent application: &#8220;Novel compounds have now been found with superior anti-bactericidal activities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In one aspect, there is provided a compound of formula (I):</p>\n<p>&#8220;##STR00002##</p>\n<p>&#8220;or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof; wherein L.sub.1 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.m--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene, C.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or benzylene, wherein m is selected from 1 to 5; wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are independently selected from H or CH.sub.3, or</p>\n<p>&#8220;R.sub.1 is selected from H or CH.sub.3 and R.sub.2 is</p>\n<p>&#8220;##STR00003##</p>\n<p>&#8220;wherein L.sub.2 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.n--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene, C.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or benzylene, wherein n is selected from 1 to 5; wherein R.sub.3-R.sub.8 are independently H, Cl, I, Br or F; wherein at least one of R.sub.3-R.sub.8 is Cl, I, Br or F; wherein R.sub.9</p>\n<p>&#8220;##STR00004##</p>\n<p>&#8220;wherein L.sub.3 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.o--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene, C.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or benzylene, wherein o is selected from 1 to 5; wherein L.sub.4 is --(CH.sub.2).sub.p--, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkenylene, C.sub.2-C.sub.5 alkynylene, C.sub.3-C.sub.6 cycloalkylene, phenylene or benzylene, wherein p is selected from 1 to 5; wherein R.sub.10, R.sub.11 and R.sub.12 are independently H or --CH.sub.3.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
