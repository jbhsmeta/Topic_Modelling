    "text": "In a nod to local restaurants that have seen business and revenue plummet due\nto the coronavirus, the Woodland City Council approved an urgency ordinance\nthat allows for outdoor dining.\n\nThe ordinance got unanimous approval during a Tuesday night teleconference and\ncomes after Yolo County approved reopening many businesses last week as cases\nof the coronavirus stabilize.\n\nRestaurants have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. Because of the\npandemic, they were forced to close in late March and have been unable to\nreopen, putting hundreds of people out of work locally and hundreds of\nthousands out of work nationally. Some restaurants have provided take-out or\ncurbside service, but it has not been nearly enough to make up for lost\nrevenue.\n\nIn California, new health guidelines allow restaurants\n\nto reopen but only under strict conditions. Many restaurants have been making\npreparations to reopen but with diners spaced farther apart, as well as\nchecking the temperatures of patrons along with requiring they facemasks prior\nto service.\n\nThe urgency ordinance is necessary because from a legal standpoint, businesses\nare not allowed to expand their services onto public spaces such as sidewalks\nor parking areas. It would also allow restaurants to serve alcohol in a public\nsetting, something not allowed under rules by the state Alcohol Beverage\nControl board.\n\nThe goal of the ordinance is to help existing Woodland businesses and\nrestaurants expand their physical space so they can be compliant with state\nand county public health orders, according to city officials, requiring\nphysical distancing while also ensuring that the restaurants and businesses\noperate in a manner that is not injurious to the public health, safety, and\nwelfare.\n\nThe ordinance proposes a streamlined permitting process that requires approval\nof an emergency temporary use permit by the Community Development director.\nThe director would have the authority to grant emergency temporary use permits\nprovided that the restaurant or business operates in compliance with all\napplicable state and county public health orders, does not violate the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and does not operate in a manner hazardous to\nthe public health.\n\nInterim City Manager Ken Hiatt called it a \"good gesture toward supporting\nthose businesses impacted in our community.\" He said some restaurant owners\nwere already expressing interest since they \"are the ones most constrained.\"\n\nThe amount of space would vary depending on individual restaurants but include\nsidewalk space or a \"couple of parking spaces\" in front of or near a\nrestaurant. The specifics would have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHiatt said the urgency ordinance \"would carry us through the emergency period\"\nand provide a grace period to demobilize. It could also be extended if needed.\n\nWoodland Mayor Rich Lansburgh said he was a little worried about liability,\nparticularly if restaurant patrons were drinking wine or alcohol. However,\ncity staff noted businesses would be required to provide proof of liability.\n\nLansburgh said he understood but also wanted to public to understand that the\ncity was not giving carte blanche and permitting people to drink alcohol in\nany public space such as a park.\n\nHe urged Hiatt to work with Police Chief Derrek Kaff to get the word out on\nthe Police Department's social media platforms. \"He has more friends than we\ndo,\" Lansburgh said.\n\nCouncilman Angel Barajas said he supported the ordinance but wondered who\nwould be monitoring the physical distancing as well as checking for\nviolations. However, Erika Bumgardner, who is the city's business development\nliaison, said that would be up to the city's Code Enforcement officers, who\nwould be checking.\n\nBumgardner said generally restaurants found in violation would be given the\nbenefit of the doubt on a first offense, particularly since both servers and\ncustomers would probably have to get acclimated to the changes. However, if\nthere was a blatant disregard for the regulations, there would be a penalty or\nfine.\n\nThe local ordinance isn't unique. Acting on Tuesday, the Santa Cruz Board of\nSupervisors approved temporary permits to allow restaurants, retailers and\nother businesses in the unincorporated areas to expand into their parking lots\nfor up to 180 days.\n\nAnd like Woodland, Santa Cruz also waived fees for the permits.\n\nBoth Woodland and Santa Cruz officials also noted that dining, or shopping,\noutdoors may lower the risk of transmission of the coronavirus while making\nsocial-distancing requirements easier to follow for businesses.\n\nContact reporter Jim Smith at 530-406-6230.",

    "title": "WOODLAND\n\nCouncil allows restaurants to expand onto public property",
    "html": "<p>In a nod to local restaurants that have seen business and revenue plummet due to the coronavirus, the <org>Woodland City Council</org> approved an urgency ordinance that allows for outdoor dining.</p>\n<p>The ordinance got unanimous approval during a Tuesday night teleconference and comes after <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.yolo\">Yolo County</location> approved reopening many businesses last week as cases of the coronavirus stabilize.</p>\n\n<p>Restaurants have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. Because of the pandemic, they were forced to close in late March and have been unable to reopen, putting hundreds of people out of work locally and hundreds of thousands out of work nationally. Some restaurants have provided take-out or curbside service, but it has not been nearly enough to make up for lost revenue.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>, new health guidelines allow restaurants</p>\n\n<p>to reopen but only under strict conditions. Many restaurants have been making preparations to reopen but with diners spaced farther apart, as well as checking the temperatures of patrons along with requiring they facemasks prior to service.</p>\n\n<p>The urgency ordinance is necessary because from a legal standpoint, businesses are not allowed to expand their services onto public spaces such as sidewalks or parking areas. It would also allow restaurants to serve alcohol in a public setting, something not allowed under rules by the state Alcohol Beverage Control board.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the ordinance is to help existing <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.wooand\">Woodland</location> businesses and restaurants expand their physical space so they can be compliant with state and county public health orders, according to city officials, requiring physical distancing while also ensuring that the restaurants and businesses operate in a manner that is not injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare.</p>\n\n<p>The ordinance proposes a streamlined permitting process that requires approval of an emergency temporary use permit by the <org>Community Development</org> director. The director would have the authority to grant emergency temporary use permits provided that the restaurant or business operates in compliance with all applicable state and county public health orders, does not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, and does not operate in a manner hazardous to the public health.</p>\n\n<p>Interim City Manager <person>Ken Hiatt</person> called it a \"good gesture toward supporting those businesses impacted in our community.\" He said some restaurant owners were already expressing interest since they \"are the ones most constrained.\"</p>\n\n<p>The amount of space would vary depending on individual restaurants but include sidewalk space or a \"couple of parking spaces\" in front of or near a restaurant. The specifics would have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n<p>Hiatt said the urgency ordinance \"would carry us through the emergency period\" and provide a grace period to demobilize. It could also be extended if needed.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.wooand\">Woodland</location> Mayor <person>Rich Lansburgh</person> said he was a little worried about liability, particularly if restaurant patrons were drinking wine or alcohol. However, city staff noted businesses would be required to provide proof of liability.</p>\n\n<p>Lansburgh said he understood but also wanted to public to understand that the city was not giving carte blanche and permitting people to drink alcohol in any public space such as a park.</p>\n\n<p>He urged Hiatt to work with Police Chief <person>Derrek Kaff</person> to get the word out on the <org>Police Department's</org> social media platforms. \"He has more friends than we do,\" Lansburgh said.</p>\n\n<p>Councilman <person>Angel Barajas</person> said he supported the ordinance but wondered who would be monitoring the physical distancing as well as checking for violations. However, <person>Erika Bumgardner</person>, who is the city's business development liaison, said that would be up to the city's Code Enforcement officers, who would be checking.</p>\n\n<p>Bumgardner said generally restaurants found in violation would be given the benefit of the doubt on a first offense, particularly since both servers and customers would probably have to get acclimated to the changes. However, if there was a blatant disregard for the regulations, there would be a penalty or fine.</p>\n\n<p>The local ordinance isn't unique. Acting on Tuesday, the <org>Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors</org> approved temporary permits to allow restaurants, retailers and other businesses in the unincorporated areas to expand into their parking lots for up to 180 days.</p>\n\n<p>And like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.wooand\">Woodland</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sancruz\">Santa Cruz</location> also waived fees for the permits.</p>\n\n<p>Both <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.wooand\">Woodland</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sancruz\">Santa Cruz</location> officials also noted that dining, or shopping, outdoors may lower the risk of transmission of the coronavirus while making social-distancing requirements easier to follow for businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Contact reporter <person>Jim Smith</person> at 530-406-6230.</p>",
