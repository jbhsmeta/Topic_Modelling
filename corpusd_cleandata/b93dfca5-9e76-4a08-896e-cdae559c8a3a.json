    "text": "There has been no professional boxing in the United Kingdom since 14 March,\nwith the British Boxing Board of Control [BBBoC] announcing three days later\nthat they had cancelled all upcoming events under their jurisdiction due to\nthe coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince then, [the UK has suffered the highest number of coronavirus deaths in\nEurope](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-coronavirus-death-\ntoll-highest-europe-cases-covid-19-italy-spain-a9499181.html). Yet\nprofessional sport [continues to plot a cautious\nreturn](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sport-return-restart-date-\nschedule-calendar-football-latest-news-a9542406.html#gsc.tab=0). The 2019/20\nPremier League season is due to resume later this month. England's Test series\nagainst the West Indies will start a month later. And rugby's Gallagher\nPremiership hopes to be back by August.\n\nBoxing has also been working on a comeback. The sport is gearing up for a\nbehind-closed-doors return in the UK in July, with the BBBoC last month\nsending a five-page consultation document sent to promoters notifying them of\na raft of new safety precautions.\n\nBut will the sport of boxing return exactly as we knew it? Or has the\ncoronavirus pandemic irreversibly changed a sport that was enjoying an\nunprecedented boom period?\n\nTo find out, _The Independent_ spoke to six different figures from across the\nsport, from a world champion, to a rising star, to a promoter and manager.\nTheir thoughts vary markedly.\n\n_THE PROMOTER_\n\n__Steve Goodwin_ is a boxing manager and promoter who manages over 90 boxers\nat different levels. His growing stable includes numerous Southern Area and\nEnglish champions. He also works as a financial adviser._\n\nBoxing promoter and manager Steve Goodwin (Getty)\n\n\"I am trying to be as realistic with my fighters as I possibly can be. Because\nthere are going to be a lot of changes to boxing going forward. A lot of\nboxers are going to retire, or become journeymen, or get knocked out taking\ncrazy fights that they have been forced into. In fact, I think there is going\nto be far more change than people imagine.\n\n\"I have seen some people say that elite boxers will be hit harder than lower\nlevel fighters. That's rubbish. An elite boxer may have got paid \u00a370k for a\nfight before. Now, they might expect to make around \u00a325k. A lower level\nfighter might have earned \u00a35k, but now he is going to earn nothing. Small hall\nboxers are in danger of losing everything. Their careers are on the line here.\nTheir dreams and aspirations. Some of the guys at the top have been getting\nphenomenally overpaid in recent years and, yes, in some instances they will\nhave to accept less money. But that's life. People working for businesses up\nand down the country are having to accept less money. I'm having to accept\nless money.\n\n\"That said, I hope the sport can resume behind closed doors. Because if the\nsport totally disappears, it will fall behind in terms of airtime and\ntraction. Yes, I know that behind closed doors shows won't immediately help\nthe lower level guys, but it's not about the here and now, it's about making\nsure boxing is still a big sport when things finally return to normal. Looking\nforward, it does mean that the only people who will be able to run shows and\nmake money are either Frank Warren or Eddie Hearn. I have had boxers come to\nme and ask if I am going to put on a show behind closed doors, and I have to\nask them whether they are going to throw \u00a335k at it. Because that is what it\nis going to cost. For most, it doesn't make business sense.\n\n\"What the lower level guys have to remember is that boxers should have jobs\nanyway. All the journeymen that I manage, for example, all have full-time\njobs. The boxing helps them to buy a house, or provide the extra bits. No\nsmall hall boxer should be fighting full-time. No boxer should be fighting\nfull-time unless they are British level or above. But it's their dreams that\nare being shattered. That's the sad reality.\"\n\n_THE WORLD CHAMPION_\n\n__Josh Warrington_ has held the IBF featherweight title since 2018. He\npreviously held the British, Commonwealth, European and WBC International\nfeatherweight titles between 2013 and 2017. He was set to fight China's WBA\n(Regular) world champion Xu Can in a unification fight at Headingley in 2020.\nThat fight has now been delayed._\n\nJosh Warrington is the IBF featherweight world champion (Getty)\n\n\"I think that for the likes of myself, things will eventually get back to\nnormal. Prior to this boxing was booming and it's probably the healthiest the\nsport has ever been. The likes of Eddie [Hearn] and Frank [Warren] get a lot\nof stick but when I first started fighting, shows were still being put on at\nleisure centres. A British title fight was a headliner with an eight rounder\nas chief support. Now, we have stadium fights every other week. And the\nbiggest names in boxing come to these shores to fight. We have exciting young\ntalent and we have a handful of world champions, too. So I think those careers\nwill resume.\n\n\"It's hard to know what is going to happen in the future. But we have to stay\noptimistic. And, in some ways, I think that boxing could perhaps even benefit\nin the long term from this. Not straight away. But when the sport is back\npeople are going to appreciate it even more than before. You know, you don't\nknow what you have until it is gone sort of thing. We might be boxing behind\nclosed doors and, sure, that will be gutting for everybody, especially the\nfans who will not be able to come and watch us fight. But if they get to watch\nus on live television then that is still something.\n\n\"The thought of boxing behind closed doors doesn't bother me that much. I've\nboxed as an amateur at places that are practically empty. I have boxed at huge\narenas where there was virtually no audience. A few things will be different,\nsuch as the ring walk, and maybe you will not be able to get quite as hyped as\nyou are walking to the ring. I know some boxers who live off the crowd and who\nare going to be affected. But once that bell goes I can't see or hear anything\nanyway. So I don't think that it's going to affect my performance at all.\"",

    "html": "<p>There has been no professional boxing in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location> since 14 March, with the British Boxing <org>Board of Control</org> [BBBoC] announcing three days later that they had cancelled all upcoming events under their jurisdiction due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>Since then, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-highest-europe-cases-covid-19-italy-spain-a9499181.html\">the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> has suffered the highest number of coronavirus deaths in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location></a>. Yet professional sport <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sport-return-restart-date-schedule-calendar-football-latest-news-a9542406.html#gsc.tab=0\">continues to plot a cautious return</a>. The 2019/20 <org>Premier League</org> season is due to resume later this month. England&#8217;s Test series against the West Indies will start a month later. And rugby&#8217;s Gallagher Premiership hopes to be back by August.</p>\n<p>Boxing has also been working on a comeback. The sport is gearing up for a behind-closed-doors return in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> in July, with the BBBoC last month sending a five-page consultation document sent to promoters notifying them of a raft of new safety precautions.</p>\n<p>But will the sport of boxing return exactly as we knew it? Or has the coronavirus pandemic irreversibly changed a sport that was enjoying an unprecedented boom period?</p>\n<p>To find out, <em>The Independent</em> spoke to six different figures from across the sport, from a world champion, to a rising star, to a promoter and manager. Their thoughts vary markedly.</p>\n<p><em>THE PROMOTER</em></p>\n<p><em><em><person>Steve Goodwin</person></em> is a boxing manager and promoter who manages over 90 boxers at different levels. His growing stable includes numerous Southern Area and English champions. He also works as a financial adviser.</em></p>\n<p>Boxing promoter and manager <person>Steve Goodwin</person> (Getty)</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am trying to be as realistic with my fighters as I possibly can be. Because there are going to be a lot of changes to boxing going forward. A lot of boxers are going to retire, or become journeymen, or get knocked out taking crazy fights that they have been forced into. In fact, I think there is going to be far more change than people imagine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have seen some people say that elite boxers will be hit harder than lower level fighters. That&#8217;s rubbish. An elite boxer may have got paid &#163;70k for a fight before. Now, they might expect to make around &#163;25k. A lower level fighter might have earned &#163;5k, but now he is going to earn nothing. Small hall boxers are in danger of losing everything. Their careers are on the line here. Their dreams and aspirations. Some of the guys at the top have been getting phenomenally overpaid in recent years and, yes, in some instances they will have to accept less money. But that&#8217;s life. People working for businesses up and down the country are having to accept less money. I&#8217;m having to accept less money.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That said, I hope the sport can resume behind closed doors. Because if the sport totally disappears, it will fall behind in terms of airtime and traction. Yes, I know that behind closed doors shows won&#8217;t immediately help the lower level guys, but it&#8217;s not about the here and now, it&#8217;s about making sure boxing is still a big sport when things finally return to normal. Looking forward, it does mean that the only people who will be able to run shows and make money are either <person>Frank Warren</person> or <person>Eddie Hearn</person>. I have had boxers come to me and ask if I am going to put on a show behind closed doors, and I have to ask them whether they are going to throw &#163;35k at it. Because that is what it is going to cost. For most, it doesn&#8217;t make business sense.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What the lower level guys have to remember is that boxers should have jobs anyway. All the journeymen that I manage, for example, all have full-time jobs. The boxing helps them to buy a house, or provide the extra bits. No small hall boxer should be fighting full-time. No boxer should be fighting full-time unless they are British level or above. But it&#8217;s their dreams that are being shattered. That&#8217;s the sad reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>THE WORLD CHAMPION</em></p>\n<p><em><em><person>Josh Warrington</person></em> has held the IBF featherweight title since 2018. He previously held the British, Commonwealth, <org>European and WBC International</org> featherweight titles between 2013 and 2017. He was set to fight China&#8217;s WBA (Regular) world champion <person>Xu Can</person> in a unification fight at Headingley in 2020. That fight has now been delayed.</em></p>\n<p><person>Josh Warrington</person> is the IBF featherweight world champion (Getty)</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that for the likes of myself, things will eventually get back to normal. Prior to this boxing was booming and it&#8217;s probably the healthiest the sport has ever been. The likes of <person>Eddie [Hearn]</person> and <person>Frank [Warren]</person> get a lot of stick but when I first started fighting, shows were still being put on at leisure centres. A British title fight was a headliner with an eight rounder as chief support. Now, we have stadium fights every other week. And the biggest names in boxing come to these shores to fight. We have exciting young talent and we have a handful of world champions, too. So I think those careers will resume.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to know what is going to happen in the future. But we have to stay optimistic. And, in some ways, I think that boxing could perhaps even benefit in the long term from this. Not straight away. But when the sport is back people are going to appreciate it even more than before. You know, you don&#8217;t know what you have until it is gone sort of thing. We might be boxing behind closed doors and, sure, that will be gutting for everybody, especially the fans who will not be able to come and watch us fight. But if they get to watch us on live television then that is still something.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thought of boxing behind closed doors doesn&#8217;t bother me that much. I&#8217;ve boxed as an amateur at places that are practically empty. I have boxed at huge arenas where there was virtually no audience. A few things will be different, such as the ring walk, and maybe you will not be able to get quite as hyped as you are walking to the ring. I know some boxers who live off the crowd and who are going to be affected. But once that bell goes I can&#8217;t see or hear anything anyway. So I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s going to affect my performance at all.&#8221;</p>",
