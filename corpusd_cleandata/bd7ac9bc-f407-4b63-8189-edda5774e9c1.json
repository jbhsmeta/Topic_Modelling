    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Women's\nHealth Daily \\-- Current study results on Mosquito-Borne Diseases - Zika Virus\nhave been published. According to news reporting from Athens, Greece, by\nNewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The global epidemic of Zika virus has\nbeen a major public health problem affecting pregnant women and their infants.\nZika virus causes a viral disease transmitted to humans mainly by the infected\nmosquito bite.\"\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University\nof West Attica, \"The infection is not severe in most cases; however, there is\nevidence that infection during pregnancy may be associated with fetal genetic\nabnormalities (including microcephaly). In addition to microcephaly and other\nmalformations, some specific lesions in the central nervous system have been\nreported. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the risk of\ndeveloping microcephaly in infants whose mothers were infected with Zika virus\nin pregnancy. Epidemiological studies and case reports were incorporated in\nour review, finally including 15 articles from an initial pool of 355 related\npapers. Most studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to the\ndevelopment of neonatal microcephaly. The period considered most dangerous is\nthe first trimester and the beginning or the whole of the second trimester.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In order to\nunderstand the relationship between Zika virus and microcephaly in infants, a\ncohort study will be able to estimate the time from the onset of Zika\ninfection and the full spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Zika Virus and the Risk of\nDeveloping Microcephaly in Infants: A Systematic Review. _International\nJournal of Environmental Research and Public Health_ , 2020;17(11):3806.\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting E. Orovou, Dept. of Midwifery, University of West Attica, 12243\nAthens, Greece. Additional authors for this research include E. Antoniou, A.\nSarella, M. Iliadou, N. Rigas, E. Palaska, G. Iatrakis and M. Dagla.\n\nThe direct object identifier (DOI) for that additional information is:\n<https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17113806>.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at NewsRx Women&#8217;s <org>Health Daily</org> -- Current study results on Mosquito-Borne Diseases - Zika Virus have been published. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gr..athens\">Athens, Greece</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;The global epidemic of Zika virus has been a major public health problem affecting pregnant women and their infants. Zika virus causes a viral disease transmitted to humans mainly by the infected mosquito bite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the <org>University of West Attica</org>, &#8220;The infection is not severe in most cases; however, there is evidence that infection during pregnancy may be associated with fetal genetic abnormalities (including microcephaly). In addition to microcephaly and other malformations, some specific lesions in the central nervous system have been reported. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the risk of developing microcephaly in infants whose mothers were infected with Zika virus in pregnancy. Epidemiological studies and case reports were incorporated in our review, finally including 15 articles from an initial pool of 355 related papers. Most studies have linked maternal infection during pregnancy to the development of neonatal microcephaly. The period considered most dangerous is the first trimester and the beginning or the whole of the second trimester.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;In order to understand the relationship between Zika virus and microcephaly in infants, a cohort study will be able to estimate the time from the onset of Zika infection and the full spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Zika Virus and the Risk of Developing Microcephaly in Infants: A Systematic Review. <em><org>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</org></em>, 2020;17(11):3806.</p>\n<p>Our news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by contacting E.
