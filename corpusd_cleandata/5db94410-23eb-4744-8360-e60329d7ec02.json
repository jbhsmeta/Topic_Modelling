    "text": "After initially opening on a limited, reservation-only basis on May 20, the\nAlaska SeaLife Center in Seward announced last week they will be open to the\npublic five days a week through the month of June.\n\n\"After just two weeks of being open, we have seen so much support from our\nfellow Alaskans,\" Tara Reimer, president and CEO of the SeaLife Center, said\nin a June 4 release. \"The health, safety and well-being of every guest, staff\nmember and animal is still our utmost priority, but we are thrilled to\ncontinue our mission by delivering a world-class experience for visitors.\"\n\nVisitor entry will stop an hour before closing, and due to hourly capacity\nlimits, making a reservation online is encouraged.\n\nTickets can now be purchased at the door, but visitors may have to wait for a\nlater entry if the center is at capacity when they arrive.\n\nEnhanced health and safety measures will still be in effect due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe touch tank is open, but with modifications to ensure visitors can maintain\nsocial distance. The fishing boat play structure and tours are still closed,\nbut limited tours may return by the end of June.\n\nVisitors, staff members and volunteers are required to wear face coverings,\nexcept for those under 2 years old and those with a medical condition that\nprohibits the use of a face covering.\n\nAdditional hand sanitizer stations are also located throughout the center for\nvisitor use.\n\nFor more information on the current health and safety protocols in place at\nthe ASLC, visit\n[Alaskasealife.org/reopening](http://Alaskasealife.org/reopening).",

The fishing boat play structure and tours are still closed, but limited tours may return by the end of June.</p>\n\n<p>Visitors, staff members and volunteers are required to wear face coverings, except for those under 2 years old and those with a medical condition that prohibits the use of a face covering.</p>\n\n<p>Additional hand sanitizer stations are also located throughout the center for visitor use.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the current health and safety protocols in place at the ASLC, visit <a href=\"http://Alaskasealife.org/reopening\">Alaskasealife.org/reopening</a>.</p>",
