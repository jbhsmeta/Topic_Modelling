    "text": "In any other time, the sign would be mysterious.\n\nSitting along Broad Street in Statesville, the white sign boasted stark black\nblock letters: Hand Sanitizer. With a pointing arrow aimed at the Signal Hill\nMall lot.\n\nThat's all the initial sign had. And then there was the Southern Distilling\nCompany tent. Just one lone tent sitting in the virtually empty mall lot, with\ntwo ladies facing the street, a counter of distillery-created hand sanitizer\nsitting in front of them.\n\nLucy Coarsey and Nicole Norton offered insight to customers who stopped to ask\nabout both their alcoholic beverages (which were not for sale at the booth)\nand their new turn to hand sanitizer (which was). They had been there just\npart of the day and had seen 50 people by early afternoon.\n\nThe night before they were at Fourth Creek Brewing. They're working to help\nthe community have access to one of the hottest commodities around since the\ncoronavirus pandemic struck - hand sanitizer.\n\nSouthern Distilling adjusted quickly to producing sanitizer and has since\ndonated the product to a variety of first responder groups. Now it is getting\nit out to the community at sites such as this one.\n\nNorton and Coarsey pointed out how versatile the product was, and that it can\nbe used on surfaces, dissolves quickly and leaves no residue or odor.\n\nCoarsey brings her own unique perspective to the pandemic. She was working for\nthe New York Metropolitan Opera when the coronavirus outbreak began. She came\nhome on March 20 and self-isolated for 14 days, then discovered the job at\nSouthern Distilling via Facebook.\n\nShe lauds the change that Southern Distilling made as helping not only with\nthe sanitizer shortage, but also with keeping locals employed.\n\n\"People who were put out of their business, they were able to get jobs and job\nsecurity and they've been able to employee so many people,\" she said.\n\nBusiness was somewhat brisk in the afternoon at the tent. It will be appearing\nthroughout Iredell in the coming days. To keep up with the pop-up sales, visit\n<https://www.facebook.com/southerndistilling>.",

    "html": "<p>In any other time, the sign would be mysterious.</p>\n<p>Sitting along <location>Broad Street</location> in Statesville, the white sign boasted stark black block letters: Hand Sanitizer. With a pointing arrow aimed at the <location>Signal Hill Mall</location> lot.</p>\n\n<p>That's all the initial sign had. And then there was the <org>Southern Distilling Company</org> tent. Just one lone tent sitting in the virtually empty mall lot, with two ladies facing the street, a counter of distillery-created hand sanitizer sitting in front of them.</p>\n\n<p><person>Lucy Coarsey</person> and <person>Nicole Norton</person> offered insight to customers who stopped to ask about both their alcoholic beverages (which were not for sale at the booth) and their new turn to hand sanitizer (which was). They had been there just part of the day and had seen 50 people by early afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>The night before they were at Fourth Creek Brewing. They're working to help the community have access to one of the hottest commodities around since the coronavirus pandemic struck - hand sanitizer.</p>\n\n<p>Southern Distilling adjusted quickly to producing sanitizer and has since donated the product to a variety of first responder groups. Now it is getting it out to the community at sites such as this one.</p>\n\n<p>Norton and Coarsey pointed out how versatile the product was, and that it can be used on surfaces, dissolves quickly and leaves no residue or odor.</p>\n\n<p>Coarsey brings her own unique perspective to the pandemic. She was working for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.nyc\">New York</location> Metropolitan Opera when the coronavirus outbreak began. She came home on <chron>March 20</chron> and self-isolated for 14 days, then discovered the job at Southern Distilling via <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org>.</p>\n\n<p>She lauds the change that Southern Distilling made as helping not only with the sanitizer shortage, but also with keeping locals employed.</p>\n\n<p>\"People who were put out of their business, they were able to get jobs and job security and they've been able to employee so many people,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Business was somewhat brisk in the afternoon at the tent. It will be appearing throughout Iredell in the coming days.
