    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Engineering\nBusiness Daily \\-- According to news reporting originating from Washington,\nD.C., by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventor Ormerod,\nMark (Cheltenham, GB), filed on November 21, 2019, was made available online\non May 21, 2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent application is Tbs Engineering Limited\n(Gloucester, United Kingdom).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"In the manufacture of batteries, particularly for\nexample lead acid batteries, it is known to cast connectors known as 'straps'\nand other formations onto the 'lugs' (or 'tabs') of battery plates. For\nexample, straps are formed to provide a connection between a set of plates\nwithin a cell of the battery. Straps are generally cast using a 'cast on strap\nmachine' in which a mould cavity is filed with molten metal (normally molten\nlead) before the lugs of a group of battery plates are dipped into the cavity\nprior to the cooling of the lead. The mould for forming such straps general\ncomprises a plurality of cavities each configured to form a separate strap\nacross a 'pack' or 'group' comprising a plurality of battery plates. The mould\nmay for example include a series of generally paired cavities spaced along the\nlength of the mould such that each pair of cavities can form a positive and\nnegative strap for a single group of batteries (and with the mould, therefore,\nforming a plurality of groups spaced along the length in a single process).\n\n\"Typically, the mould cavities are filled by allowing lead to flow into\nchannels at the sides of the cavities and spill over a weir into the mould. An\nexample of such a moulding apparatus is shown in the Applicant's earlier\npublished PCT Application WO94/16466. In order to ensure a good connection\nbetween the lugs and casting, the lead must remain hot until the lugs are in\nposition. However, in order to minimise cycle time in production, the lead\nmust be cooled as quickly as possible once the plates are in position.\n\n\"It is important that the volume of lead is carefully controlled during strap\ncasting as excess lead (for example as a result of mould features such as\nweirs) will have an impact on both the cost and weight of the final battery\nproduced.\n\n\"As such, the Applicants have recently proposed a new battery moulding\napparatus in published UK Patent Application GB2507485. In this arrangement a\nreciprocating sliding block is used to provide an accurately measured volume\nof lead for each cavity of a mould. Embodiments of the invention seek to\nprovide further improvements over the arrangement proposed in GB2507485 which\nmay for example, further reduce the cycle time and/or further improve\nconsistent measuring of lead and/or provide delivery of lead with minimal\ncooling during transit to the mould and/or provide improved ease of\nmaintenance or usage of the apparatus.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx editors also obtained the inventor's summary information for this\npatent application: \"According to the first aspect of the present invention\nthere is provided a mould for forming battery components (which may for\nexample be cast on straps) the mould comprising a first mould body comprising\na first plurality of mould cavities; a second mould body comprising a second\nplurality of mould cavities; wherein said first mould body and said second\nmould bodies are configured to be moveable between: a moulding position in\nwhich the first plurality and second plurality of mould cavities are aligned;\nand a fill position in which the first plurality and second plurality of mould\ncavities are displaced from the aligned position and are proximal to a molten\nmetal feed.\n\n\"The applicants have recognised that by providing mould portions which may be\nseparately moved they can be positioned proximal to a molten metal feed such\nthat the run of molten metal into the mould cavity may be minimised. For\nexample, the molten metal may be poured directly into the cavity. Equally, by\nmoving the mould portions back to an aligned position (which may for example\nbe fixed relative to a predetermined datum) a group of battery plates may be\naligned relative to the mould cavities without being impeded by the metal\nfeed. Thus embodiments of the invention may reduce or mitigate issues related\nto cooling of the metal prior to forming of the straps and may, for example,\navoid the need to provide additional heated channels or passageways between\nthe lead supply and the cavities.\n\n\"In the aligned position the first and second mould bodies may be arranged to\nprovide a single moulding apparatus. The first and second mould bodies may,\nfor example, abut in the aligned position.\n\n\"Typically, the mould may be an elongate mould and may define a series of\nmould cavities spaced along a longitudinal direction of the mould. The first\nmould body and the second mould body may each comprise a longitudinal half of\nthe elongate mould. Thus, in the aligned position the first mould body and\nsecond mould body may generally abut along a longitudinal centreline of the\nmould.\n\n\"The first plurality of mould cavities and the second plurality of mould\ncavities may jointly define a plurality of pairs of mould cavities spaced\nalong the longitudinal direction of the mould. Thus, for example it will be\nappreciated that, in use, each pair of cavities may be used for casting a pair\nof straps for a single group of battery plates. Each pair of mould cavities\nmay include a cavity in each mould body.\n\n\"The mould may be used with a modified cast on strap machine which includes a\nmould positioner. Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention there\nis provided a cast on strap machine for moulding battery components, the\nmachine comprising: a molten metal delivery apparatus; a battery plate\npositioning device; and a mould comprising a first mould body comprising a\nfirst plurality of mould cavities and a second mould body comprising a second\nplurality of mould cavities; and wherein the machine further comprises: a\nmould positioner configured to move the first mould body and said second mould\nbody between: a moulding position in which the first plurality and second\nplurality of mould cavities are aligned relative to the battery plate\npositioning device; and a fill position in which the first plurality and\nsecond plurality of mould cavities are displaced from the aligned position and\nare proximal to an outlet of the metal delivery apparatus. The molten metal\ndelivery apparatus may be arranged for delivering a predetermined volume of\nlead to the mould. Typically, the molten metal may be molten lead. The metal\ndelivery apparatus may, for example, be arranged to measure and supply a\npredetermined volume of lead substantially in the manner described in UK\n\n\"The battery plate positioning device may for example be arranged to hold and\nposition groups of battery plates relative to the mould. For example, the\nbattery plate positioning device may be a jig box. It will be appreciated that\nthe battery plate positioning device is generally arranged to position a group\nof battery plates relative to the mould during casting such that the tabs of a\ngroup of battery plates can be moved into the mould cavities and the lead can\nsolidify so as to form straps connecting the tabs. Advantageously, as the\nmould bodies are moveable between the fill position and the moulding position\nthe positioning of the battery plates may be unimpeded by the metal delivery\napparatus or other metal delivery features when the mould bodies are in the\nmoulding position.\n\n\"The molten metal delivery apparatus may comprise first and second molten\nmetal delivery apparatuses associated respectively with the first and second\nmould bodies. For example, a molten metal delivery apparatus may be provided\nadjacent to each of the first and second mould bodies. The first and second\nmolten metal delivery apparatuses may be positioned on opposing sides of the\ncast on strap machine with the mould provided between the metal delivery\napparatuses.\n\n\"The first and second molten metal delivery apparatuses may be fed from a\ncommon lead supply.\n\n\"The first and second molten metal delivery apparatuses may each comprise a\nplurality of outlets. One outlet may, for example, be associated with each of\nthe mould cavities. The, or each, outlet may comprise a through-cavity formed\nin a slideably mounted block and arranged to receive lead into the upper end\nof the through cavity when the block is in a first position and release lead\nfrom the lower end of the through cavity when the block is in a second\nposition. The, or each, outlet may be associated with a local metal reservoir.\n\n\"The, or each, outlet is arranged to dispense lead directly into a mould\ncavity when the mould bodies are in the fill position.\n\n\"The mould positioner is arranged to move said first mould body and said\nsecond mould body linearly. For example, the mould positioner may slide the\nfirst and said second mould bodies outwardly away from a nominal longitudinal\ncentre line of the mould when moving from the moulding position to the fill\nposition (and moving the bodies towards the nominal centre line when moving to\nthe moulding position).\n\n\"The mould positioner may be arranged to reciprocate the first mould body and\nsecond mould body between the moulding and fill positions in use. The mould\npositioner may include a crank mechanism connected to the first and second\nmould bodies. A single drive may be provided with opposing out of phase crank\narms for moving the first and second mould bodies. Advantageously, a crank\nmechanism may progressively decelerate the mould bodies as they approach the\nend positions of the motion (i.e. the fill and moulding positions) which is\nparticular important when the mould is being moved with the cavities filled\nwith molten metal.\n\n\"The molten metal delivery apparatus may be configured such that when the\nfirst and second mould bodies are in the fill position the mould bodies are\nheated by heat transfer from the delivery apparatus. For example, the mould\nbodies may be positioned adjacent to a hot surface of the molten metal\ndelivery apparatus such that it is heated by radiant or conductive heat\ntransfer. Advantageously such an arrangement may remove the need to provide\nany direct heating to the mould bodies.\n\n\"The cast on strap machine may further be provided with a mould loading\napparatus.\n\n\"Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a\ncast on strap machine comprising a molten metal delivery apparatus; a battery\nplate positioning device; a mould comprising a plurality of mould cavities;\nand a mould loading apparatus arranged to move the mould between an in use\nconfiguration and a configuration in which the mould is external to the cast\non strap machine to allow access to the mould.\n\n\"The mould loading apparatus may be arranged to automate the removal and\ninsertion of the mould into the cast on strap machine. For example, the mould\nloading apparatus may be utilised to service or interchange the mould during\nuse.\n\n\"The mould loading apparatus may comprises an elevator arranged to raise/lower\nthe mould between a first height corresponding to the plane of the in use\nposition of the mould and a second height where the mould is positioned out of\nthe in use plane. By moving the mould out of the plane of the in use position\nit may be raised above or below the lead delivery apparatus such that it can\nbe conveniently be moved into or out of the cast on strap machine. For\nexample, the elevator may be arranged to lower the mould below the plane of a\nbase member of the operational section of the cast on strap machine.\n\n\"The mould loading apparatus may further comprise a lateral positioning\nmember. The lateral position arrangement may be arranged to move the mould\nbetween an internal position, in alignment with the in use configuration, and\nan external position in which the mould is positioned to a side of the cast on\nstrap machine. The lateral positioning arrangement may move the elevator.\n\n\"The lateral positioning arrangement may comprise a fixed support frame and a\nmoveable frame slidable mounted theretto. The lateral positioning arrangement\nmay be below the working area of the cast on lead machine.\n\n\"The mould loading apparatus may comprise a cradle for supporting the mould.\nThe cradle may, for example, be provided on the elevator. An ejection device\nmay be provided for removing the mould from the cradle when the mould is in\nthe in use configuration.\n\n\"According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a lead\ndelivery apparatus for a cast on strap machine arranged to deliver a\npredetermined volume of molten lead to a mould, comprising: a housing defining\na lead reservoir having a lead outlet defined in its base and in communication\nwith the reservoir; a runway beneath the base, spaced from the base and\nsubstantially parallel thereto; a block slideably mounted between the base and\nthe runway, the block having a through cavity defining the predetermined\nvolume for receiving lead from the outlet of the reservoir in a first position\nand for releasing the lead in a second position; and a mechanism for\nreciprocating the block between the first and second positions; and\ncharacterised in that the apparatus further comprises a clamp arranged to\nselectively secure an upper portion of the housing such that the housing\nand/or block may be removable.\n\n\"The clamp may comprise a pivotable clamping member. The clamping member may\nbe pivotally connected to the apparatus at, or proximal to, a first end of\nfastener for securing the clamping member in a closed configuration. The\nfastener may comprise quick release mechanism. The fastener may engage at, or\nproximal to, a free end of the clamping member.\n\n\"The clamp and reservoir housing may be provided with interconnecting features\nwhich fix the housing relative to the clamp (and therefore relative to the\nhousing) when the clamp is in a closed configuration. The interconnecting\nfeatures may comprise a projection on one of the housing or clamp and a\ncorresponding aperture defined by the other of the clamp or housing. The clamp\nmay be configured such that the projection is retained in the aperture when\nthe clamp is in the closed configuration. For example, the aperture may be\ndefined by a notch or recess in the clamp. The notch or recess may be defined\nin the pivotable clamping member or in an opposing surface thereof, or jointly\ndefined by the profile of such opposing surfaces. For example the clamping\nmember and opposing surface (which may for example be a fixed member of the\nclamp from which the clamping member is pivoted) may have stepped profiles\nwhich in the closed position jointly define the aperture.\n\n\"The clamp may further comprise a reservoir cover. The reservoir cover may\nclose an upper portion of the reservoir when the clamp is in a closed\nconfiguration. The reservoir cover may be pivotally connected to the clamp\n(such that it may self-align with the reservoir housing).\n\n\"According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of\nmoulding battery components comprising the steps of: providing a two part\nmould, each mould part comprising a plurality of mould cavities; separating\nthe mould parts and providing a supply of molten metal to each of the\nplurality of mould cavities with the mould parts at spaced apart locations;\nand moving the filled mould parts to an aligned position to form the battery\ncomponents.\n\n\"The method may further comprising the step of: providing a plurality of\naligned battery plates (which may for example be arranged in one or more\ngroups); and, after the step of moving the filed mould parts into an aligned\nposition, positioning the plurality of battery plates relative to the mould\nsuch that a portion of the plurality of battery plates lie within the mould\ncavities; and allowing the molten metal to solidify so as to form a connection\nbetween the plurality of battery plates.\n\n\"The method may further comprises moving the plurality of battery plates away\nfrom the away from the mould to eject the moulded battery components from the\nmould. After ejection of the moulded battery components the step of separating\nthe mould parts (and the subsequent steps) may be repeated to start a further\nmoulding cycle.\n\n\"Whilst the invention has been described above, it extends to any inventive\ncombination of features set out above or in the following description or\ndrawings.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1-15.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Engineering Business Daily</org> -- According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.dc.wash\">Washington, D.C.</location>, by NewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventor Ormerod, Mark (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.chelte\">Cheltenham</location>, GB), filed on <chron>November 21, 2019</chron>, was made available online on <chron>May 21, 2020</chron>.</p>\n<p>The assignee for this patent application is <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3354759888\">Tbs Engineering Limited</org> (<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.glouce\">Gloucester, United Kingdom</location>).</p>\n<p>Reporters obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;In the manufacture of batteries, particularly for example lead acid batteries, it is known to cast connectors known as &#8216;straps&#8217; and other formations onto the &#8216;lugs&#8217; (or &#8216;tabs&#8217;) of battery plates. For example, straps are formed to provide a connection between a set of plates within a cell of the battery. Straps are generally cast using a &#8216;cast on strap machine&#8217; in which a mould cavity is filed with molten metal (normally molten lead) before the lugs of a group of battery plates are dipped into the cavity prior to the cooling of the lead. The mould for forming such straps general comprises a plurality of cavities each configured to form a separate strap across a &#8216;pack&#8217; or &#8216;group&#8217; comprising a plurality of battery plates. The mould may for example include a series of generally paired cavities spaced along the length of the mould such that each pair of cavities can form a positive and negative strap for a single group of batteries (and with the mould, therefore, forming a plurality of groups spaced along the length in a single process).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Typically, the mould cavities are filled by allowing lead to flow into channels at the sides of the cavities and spill over a weir into the mould. An example of such a moulding apparatus is shown in the Applicant&#8217;s earlier published PCT Application WO94/16466. In order to ensure a good connection between the lugs and casting, the lead must remain hot until the lugs are in position. However, in order to minimise cycle time in production, the lead must be cooled as quickly as possible once the plates are in position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is important that the volume of lead is carefully controlled during strap casting as excess lead (for example as a result of mould features such as weirs) will have an impact on both the cost and weight of the final battery produced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As such, the Applicants have recently proposed a new battery moulding apparatus in published <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> Patent Application GB2507485. In this arrangement a reciprocating sliding block is used to provide an accurately measured volume of lead for each cavity of a mould. Embodiments of the invention seek to provide further improvements over the arrangement proposed in GB2507485 which may for example, further reduce the cycle time and/or further improve consistent measuring of lead and/or provide delivery of lead with minimal cooling during transit to the mould and/or provide improved ease of maintenance or usage of the apparatus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent application: &#8220;According to the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a mould for forming battery components (which may for example be cast on straps) the mould comprising a first mould body comprising a first plurality of mould cavities; a second mould body comprising a second plurality of mould cavities; wherein said first mould body and said second mould bodies are configured to be moveable between: a moulding position in which the first plurality and second plurality of mould cavities are aligned; and a fill position in which the first plurality and second plurality of mould cavities are displaced from the aligned position and are proximal to a molten metal feed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The applicants have recognised that by providing mould portions which may be separately moved they can be positioned proximal to a molten metal feed such that the run of molten metal into the mould cavity may be minimised. For example, the molten metal may be poured directly into the cavity. Equally, by moving the mould portions back to an aligned position (which may for example be fixed relative to a predetermined datum) a group of battery plates may be aligned relative to the mould cavities without being impeded by the metal feed. Thus embodiments of the invention may reduce or mitigate issues related to cooling of the metal prior to forming of the straps and may, for example, avoid the need to provide additional heated channels or passageways between the lead supply and the cavities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the aligned position the first and second mould bodies may be arranged to provide a single moulding apparatus. The first and second mould bodies may, for example, abut in the aligned position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Typically, the mould may be an elongate mould and may define a series of mould cavities spaced along a longitudinal direction of the mould. The first mould body and the second mould body may each comprise a longitudinal half of the elongate mould. Thus, in the aligned position the first mould body and second mould body may generally abut along a longitudinal centreline of the mould.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first plurality of mould cavities and the second plurality of mould cavities may jointly define a plurality of pairs of mould cavities spaced along the longitudinal direction of the mould. Thus, for example it will be appreciated that, in use, each pair of cavities may be used for casting a pair of straps for a single group of battery plates. Each pair of mould cavities may include a cavity in each mould body.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould may be used with a modified cast on strap machine which includes a mould positioner. Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a cast on strap machine for moulding battery components, the machine comprising: a molten metal delivery apparatus; a battery plate positioning device; and a mould comprising a first mould body comprising a first plurality of mould cavities and a second mould body comprising a second plurality of mould cavities; and wherein the machine further comprises: a mould positioner configured to move the first mould body and said second mould body between: a moulding position in which the first plurality and second plurality of mould cavities are aligned relative to the battery plate positioning device; and a fill position in which the first plurality and second plurality of mould cavities are displaced from the aligned position and are proximal to an outlet of the metal delivery apparatus. The molten metal delivery apparatus may be arranged for delivering a predetermined volume of lead to the mould. Typically, the molten metal may be molten lead. The metal delivery apparatus may, for example, be arranged to measure and supply a predetermined volume of lead substantially in the manner described in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location></p>\n<p>&#8220;The battery plate positioning device may for example be arranged to hold and position groups of battery plates relative to the mould. For example, the battery plate positioning device may be a jig box. It will be appreciated that the battery plate positioning device is generally arranged to position a group of battery plates relative to the mould during casting such that the tabs of a group of battery plates can be moved into the mould cavities and the lead can solidify so as to form straps connecting the tabs. Advantageously, as the mould bodies are moveable between the fill position and the moulding position the positioning of the battery plates may be unimpeded by the metal delivery apparatus or other metal delivery features when the mould bodies are in the moulding position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The molten metal delivery apparatus may comprise first and second molten metal delivery apparatuses associated respectively with the first and second mould bodies. For example, a molten metal delivery apparatus may be provided adjacent to each of the first and second mould bodies. The first and second molten metal delivery apparatuses may be positioned on opposing sides of the cast on strap machine with the mould provided between the metal delivery apparatuses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first and second molten metal delivery apparatuses may be fed from a common lead supply.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first and second molten metal delivery apparatuses may each comprise a plurality of outlets. One outlet may, for example, be associated with each of the mould cavities. The, or each, outlet may comprise a through-cavity formed in a slideably mounted block and arranged to receive lead into the upper end of the through cavity when the block is in a first position and release lead from the lower end of the through cavity when the block is in a second position. The, or each, outlet may be associated with a local metal reservoir.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The, or each, outlet is arranged to dispense lead directly into a mould cavity when the mould bodies are in the fill position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould positioner is arranged to move said first mould body and said second mould body linearly. For example, the mould positioner may slide the first and said second mould bodies outwardly away from a nominal longitudinal centre line of the mould when moving from the moulding position to the fill position (and moving the bodies towards the nominal centre line when moving to the moulding position).</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould positioner may be arranged to reciprocate the first mould body and second mould body between the moulding and fill positions in use. The mould positioner may include a crank mechanism connected to the first and second mould bodies. A single drive may be provided with opposing out of phase crank arms for moving the first and second mould bodies. Advantageously, a crank mechanism may progressively decelerate the mould bodies as they approach the end positions of the motion (i.e. the fill and moulding positions) which is particular important when the mould is being moved with the cavities filled with molten metal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The molten metal delivery apparatus may be configured such that when the first and second mould bodies are in the fill position the mould bodies are heated by heat transfer from the delivery apparatus. For example, the mould bodies may be positioned adjacent to a hot surface of the molten metal delivery apparatus such that it is heated by radiant or conductive heat transfer. Advantageously such an arrangement may remove the need to provide any direct heating to the mould bodies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cast on strap machine may further be provided with a mould loading apparatus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a cast on strap machine comprising a molten metal delivery apparatus; a battery plate positioning device; a mould comprising a plurality of mould cavities; and a mould loading apparatus arranged to move the mould between an in use configuration and a configuration in which the mould is external to the cast on strap machine to allow access to the mould.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould loading apparatus may be arranged to automate the removal and insertion of the mould into the cast on strap machine. For example, the mould loading apparatus may be utilised to service or interchange the mould during use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould loading apparatus may comprises an elevator arranged to raise/lower the mould between a first height corresponding to the plane of the in use position of the mould and a second height where the mould is positioned out of the in use plane. By moving the mould out of the plane of the in use position it may be raised above or below the lead delivery apparatus such that it can be conveniently be moved into or out of the cast on strap machine. For example, the elevator may be arranged to lower the mould below the plane of a base member of the operational section of the cast on strap machine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould loading apparatus may further comprise a lateral positioning member. The lateral position arrangement may be arranged to move the mould between an internal position, in alignment with the in use configuration, and an external position in which the mould is positioned to a side of the cast on strap machine. The lateral positioning arrangement may move the elevator.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The lateral positioning arrangement may comprise a fixed support frame and a moveable frame slidable mounted theretto. The lateral positioning arrangement may be below the working area of the cast on lead machine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mould loading apparatus may comprise a cradle for supporting the mould. The cradle may, for example, be provided on the elevator. An ejection device may be provided for removing the mould from the cradle when the mould is in the in use configuration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a lead delivery apparatus for a cast on strap machine arranged to deliver a predetermined volume of molten lead to a mould, comprising: a housing defining a lead reservoir having a lead outlet defined in its base and in communication with the reservoir; a runway beneath the base, spaced from the base and substantially parallel thereto; a block slideably mounted between the base and the runway, the block having a through cavity defining the predetermined volume for receiving lead from the outlet of the reservoir in a first position and for releasing the lead in a second position; and a mechanism for reciprocating the block between the first and second positions; and characterised in that the apparatus further comprises a clamp arranged to selectively secure an upper portion of the housing such that the housing and/or block may be removable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The clamp may comprise a pivotable clamping member. The clamping member may be pivotally connected to the apparatus at, or proximal to, a first end of fastener for securing the clamping member in a closed configuration. The fastener may comprise quick release mechanism. The fastener may engage at, or proximal to, a free end of the clamping member.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The clamp and reservoir housing may be provided with interconnecting features which fix the housing relative to the clamp (and therefore relative to the housing) when the clamp is in a closed configuration. The interconnecting features may comprise a projection on one of the housing or clamp and a corresponding aperture defined by the other of the clamp or housing. The clamp may be configured such that the projection is retained in the aperture when the clamp is in the closed configuration. For example, the aperture may be defined by a notch or recess in the clamp. The notch or recess may be defined in the pivotable clamping member or in an opposing surface thereof, or jointly defined by the profile of such opposing surfaces. For example the clamping member and opposing surface (which may for example be a fixed member of the clamp from which the clamping member is pivoted) may have stepped profiles which in the closed position jointly define the aperture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The clamp may further comprise a reservoir cover. The reservoir cover may close an upper portion of the reservoir when the clamp is in a closed configuration. The reservoir cover may be pivotally connected to the clamp (such that it may self-align with the reservoir housing).</p>\n<p>&#8220;According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of moulding battery components comprising the steps of: providing a two part mould, each mould part comprising a plurality of mould cavities; separating the mould parts and providing a supply of molten metal to each of the plurality of mould cavities with the mould parts at spaced apart locations; and moving the filled mould parts to an aligned position to form the battery components.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The method may further comprising the step of: providing a plurality of aligned battery plates (which may for example be arranged in one or more groups); and, after the step of moving the filed mould parts into an aligned position, positioning the plurality of battery plates relative to the mould such that a portion of the plurality of battery plates lie within the mould cavities; and allowing the molten metal to solidify so as to form a connection between the plurality of battery plates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The method may further comprises moving the plurality of battery plates away from the away from the mould to eject the moulded battery components from the mould. After ejection of the moulded battery components the step of separating the mould parts (and the subsequent steps) may be repeated to start a further moulding cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whilst the invention has been described above, it extends to any inventive combination of features set out above or in the following description or drawings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1-15.
