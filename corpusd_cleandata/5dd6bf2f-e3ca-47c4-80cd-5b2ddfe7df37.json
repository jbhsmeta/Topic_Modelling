    "text": "Industry figures and venues have expressed solidarity with the Black Lives\nMatter movement and urged others to use their voices to fight racism.\n\nThose who have publicly backed the movement include London s Bush Theatre,\nHamilton writer Lin-Manuel Miranda, producer Sonia Friedman, Talawa Theatre\nCompany, Ballet Black, London s Royal Court and the Barn Theatre in\nCirencester.\n\nThe announcements on social media follow widespread protests over the killing\nof George Floyd by a policeman in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Bush Theatre suspended all normal activity on its channels for 24 hours on\nJune 1 in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, tweeting that it does not feel\nappropriate to release content that does not address recent events.\n\nThe theatre posted on Twitter: The last few days have been devastating. We re\nall fighting a pandemic right now, but there is an ongoing pandemic that has\nbeen dominant for too long and that is racism. Our building is closed so we\ncan t invite our family into our physical space in the way that we normally\nwould, but we are here with you during this upsetting time.\n\nWe will keep using our platform to represent black communities, to create\nopportunities with and for black artists, and to create work that reflects and\nchallenges the world we live in.\n\nThe statement added: If you enjoy the black stories on our stages, and consume\nblack culture, then you need to use your voice too. We can all make a\ndifference and there is more work to be done.\n\nIn a video posted on the Twitter account for Hamilton, Miranda said it was a\nmoral failure that the musical s other official channels had not yet spoken\nthe inarguable truth that black lives matter and denounced systemic racism and\nwhite supremacy .\n\nMiranda said: I m sorry for not pushing harder and faster for us to speak\nthese self-evident truths under the Hamilton banner, which has come to mean so\nmuch to so many of you. Hamilton doesn t exist without the black and brown\nartists who created, revolutionised and changed the world through the culture,\nmusic and language of hip hop. It doesn t exist without the brilliant black\nand brown artists in our cast, crew and production team who breathe life into\nthis story every time it s performed.\n\nHe added: While we live in a country where black people are under attack from\nemboldened white supremacy, police brutality and centuries of anti-black\nracism, it s up to us in words and deeds to stand up for our fellow citizens,\nit s up to us to be better allies and have each others backs.\n\nA statement from Talawa Theatre Company said the organisation was sickened by\nthe murder of George Floyd at the hands of the state machine . It added: We\nstand in solidarity with our Black writers, artists, communities, friends and\naudiences here in the UK and elsewhere. We will ensure our platform is used\nfor your voices to be amplified, your work to be shared and your communities\nrepresented.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Ballet Black said: It s positive to see dance\ncompanies responding to racial injustice. This is not just an American\nproblem. It is worldwide. For us in the UK, it is demonstrated by the Windrush\nscandal. Stop and search. Hostile environment policy. Blackface in ballet as a\n*debate*. Online abuse for the creation of brown pointe shoes. And this is a\nshortlist.\n\nThe statement adds: We ve been here for 20 years trying to make a difference.\nJoin the mission to lift black and brown voices up. Help change the power\nstructure. Call out racism. Organisations, recognise that 1,000 daily micro-\naggressions tire the souls of your black and brown artists and staff.\nGatekeepers, listen. Don t tell us equality is sold, it s not.\n\nA statement posted on Twitter by the musical Six said: Six is a show that has\nbeen seen to champion diversity and empower black femaleidentifying voices,\nand we are so proud to have this position in the theatre community. We are\nalso a show that is largely created and produced by white people - and like so\nmany shows Six benefits from the talent and work of our black cast members and\ncolleagues every day. It is therefore our duty to stand up for and support\nblack people always - and not just when it s trending - as to be silent is to\nbe complicit.\n\nOther theatres expressing solidarity include the Yard and the Almeida in\nLondon, HighTide, Manchester s Royal Exchange and Northampton s Royal and\nDerngate.",

We re all fighting a pandemic right now, but there is an ongoing pandemic that has been dominant for too long and that is racism. Our building is closed so we can t invite our family into our physical space in the way that we normally would, but we are here with you during this upsetting time.</p>\n<p>We will keep using our platform to represent black communities, to create opportunities with and for black artists, and to create work that reflects and challenges the world we live in.</p>\n<p>The statement added: If you enjoy the black stories on our stages, and consume black culture, then you need to use your voice too. We can all make a difference and there is more work to be done.</p>\n<p>In a video posted on the Twitter account for Hamilton, Miranda said it was a moral failure that the musical s other official channels had not yet spoken the inarguable truth that black lives matter and denounced systemic racism and white supremacy .</p>\n<p>Miranda said: I m sorry for not pushing harder and faster for us to speak these self-evident truths under the Hamilton banner, which has come to mean so much to so many of you. Hamilton doesn t exist without the black and brown artists who created, revolutionised and changed the world through the culture, music and language of hip hop. It doesn t exist without the brilliant black and brown artists in our cast, crew and production team who breathe life into this story every time it s performed.</p>\n<p>He added: While we live in a country where black people are under attack from emboldened white supremacy, police brutality and centuries of anti-black racism, it s up to us in words and deeds to stand up for our fellow citizens, it s up to us to be better allies and have each others backs.</p>\n<p>A statement from <org>Talawa Theatre Company</org> said the organisation was sickened by the murder of <person>George Floyd</person> at the hands of the state machine . It added: We stand in solidarity with our Black writers, artists, communities, friends and audiences here in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> and elsewhere. We will ensure our platform is used for your voices to be amplified, your work to be shared and your communities represented.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Twitter, <org>Ballet Black</org> said: It s positive to see dance companies responding to racial injustice. This is not just an American problem. It is worldwide. For us in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>, it is demonstrated by the Windrush scandal. Stop and search. Hostile environment policy. Blackface in ballet as a &#183;debate&#183;. Online abuse for the creation of brown pointe shoes. And this is a shortlist.</p>\n<p>The statement adds: We ve been here for 20 years trying to make a difference. Join the mission to lift black and brown voices up. Help change the power structure. Call out racism. Organisations, recognise that 1,000 daily micro-aggressions tire the souls of your black and brown artists and staff. Gatekeepers, listen. Don t tell us equality is sold, it s not.</p>\n<p>A statement posted on Twitter by the musical Six said: Six is a show that has been seen to champion diversity and empower black femaleidentifying voices, and we are so proud to have this position in the theatre community. We are also a show that is largely created and produced by white people - and like so many shows Six benefits from the talent and work of our black cast members and colleagues every day. It is therefore our duty to stand up for and support black people always - and not just when it s trending - as to be silent is to be complicit.</p>\n<p>Other theatres expressing solidarity include the Yard and the Almeida in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.london\">London</location>, HighTide, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.manchr\">Manchester</location> s Royal Exchange and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.northa\">Northampton</location> s Royal and Derngate.</p>",
