    "text": "Increased testing for the coronavirus in Ohio is not finding a higher rate of\npeople infected with the coronavirus.\n\nIn fact, 94% of people have tested negative in the past 40 days, leading state\nofficials and medical experts to say they are encouraged by Ohio's fight\nagainst the pandemic.\n\nBut they warn it's too soon to celebrate and return to the way life was before\nthe disease spread around the world.\n\n\"We can't let our guard down,\" said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, chief medical\nofficer for OhioHealth. \"The bigger picture for me is a positive and I am\nencouraged by the numbers. But as we return to common life we must continue\nbeing responsible and do the things we have been doing with social distancing\nand personal hygiene that helped get us to this point.\"\n\nThe data provided by the Ohio Department of Health through a records request\nby the Dispatch shows that as of Memorial Day, 340,000 tests had been\nadministered since record keeping began by the state on March 4.\n\nThat's 3 percent of the state's population. Ninety percent of the tests were\nnegative.\n\nSince the state began reopening on May 1, 94 percent of those tested were\nnegative. These are new cases, meaning it would not include people who had the\nvirus and recovered.\n\nThat number has held steady since restaurants began reopening on May 15.\n\nHere are the other key findings in the data:\n\nThe state has more than doubled tests given per day compared to what it was in\nApril. Tests given per day in May averaged 7,922 compared to 3,635 per day in\nApril.\n\nThe number of new positive cases have declined steadily from 697 a week in\nmid-April to 562 the week that ended on May 23.\n\nThe percentage of negative tests is increasing.\n\nFewer tests are being ordered by doctors. The peak tests ordered by doctors\nwas 10,879 on May 13. Since then that number has declined nearly every day.\nThere were 6,791 tests ordered on May 25.\n\nIn recent weeks the number of new tests administered has leveled off despite\nthere being more access to tests without a doctor referral.\n\nAt least 15 testing centers in the Columbus area that don't require a doctor\nreferral. Many of those testing centers are neighborhood urgent care\nfacilities and said they had been open for testing for at least two to three\nweeks.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine said in April that increased testing would give him another\n\"tool in the toolbox\" that would allow him to make better decisions.\n\n\"The more tests you have the better information you can get,\" he said.\n\nMedical experts said they are encouraged that the number of positive\ncoronavirus cases have been holding or declining the past six weeks.\n\nBut they are worried the public will declare victory against the virus far too\nsoon.\n\nDr. Michael Oglesbee, director of the Infectious Diseases Institute at the\nOhio State University, said the state needs to test many more Ohioans over an\nextended time period before making any sweeping statements.\n\n\"The next two weeks are going to be very informative as to how this all plays\nout,\" he said. \"As we start relaxing some of the measures to prevent\ninfections and including the Memorial Day holiday we are going to get some\ninformation.\"\n\nOglesbee, whose group at Ohio State came up with the projection models Dewine\nused to make his decisions early on in the pandemic, said there are some\npositives he sees in the data.\n\n\"From a trend perspective this is tremendous,\" he said. \"We have plateaued it\nappears by the numbers, but you still have to remember people are getting\ninfected.\"\n\nVanderhoff said the lull in positive cases is evidence that the state's tough\ndecisions that shut down the economy and kept people at home has been\neffective.\n\n\"I am convinced the people here in Ohio get it,\" Vanderhoff said. \"We have\ndemonstrated we can act together and do some pretty incredible stuff in a\ndifficult time. This tells us we are doing a good job but have to continue\ndoing a good job as we get our lives back.\"\n\nState Rep. Paul Zeltwanger, R-Mason, has been critical of DeWine's and Acton's\npolicies to deal the virus and called them an overreaction.\n\nZeltwanger joined another state representative last week in calling for\nActon's ouster.\n\nOglesbee said that until there is a vaccine, the only way to continue the\nfight against the virus is through herd immunity or social distancing.\n\nHe said since so few Ohioans are testing positive, herd immunity is not an\noption at this point.\n\nThe doctors also said Ohio needs to dramatically increase testing.\n\nThe state ranks 44th in coronavirus testing per 100,000 population, according\nto data collected and analyzed by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.\n\nDeWine has said the state has the daily capacity to test double the number\ntests administered but that isn't happening.\n\nIt's unclear if that's because not enough people are seeking tests, doctors\naren't recommending them or if other issues remain.\n\nThe Ohio Department of health said in an email that in order to use the full\ntesting capacity, there needs to be clear testing guidance on how to use tests\nto control the virus. The agency said it was reserving some testing to use\nduring expected outbreaks.\n\nThe health department said testing to capacity would also require an\n\"infrastructure\" to get specimen kits out for testing and back to the labs,\nwhich requires a system, something the state doesn't have, that would include\nscheduling, billing and reporting. The agency said it is close to completing a\nsystem for that.\n\nBrian Fowler, ODH's chief data officer, said a majority of those getting\ntested are still those presenting symptoms.\n\n\"We need to have as many tests as we can,\" he said. \"We know there are\npositive cases out there we are not catching.\"\n\nThe state has said it has begun testing 1,200 random Ohioans who volunteer to\nsee if they are infected or had been infected at one time with the virus.\n\nThat testing is to determine areas where the disease might have spread or be\nspreading.\n\nOhioans can get tested without a doctor's referral. Google has provided a list\nof testing centers in their area.\n\nThree urgent care centers contacted by the Dispatch said the tests are $100\nwithout insurance, but some policies cover the testing.\n\nThe turnaround time for results is two to three days.\n\n\"The virus is still there,\" said Dr. Nicholas Kreatsoulas, the chief clinical\nofficer for Mount Carmel Health System. \"We are not out of the woods yet. We\nare concerned about a possible surge in the future and people should remain\nfocused daily on how they interact with one another.\"\n\nKreatsoulas said that Mount Carmel, OhioHealth and Ohio State's health systems\nare working together to increase testing and monitoring the virus' effect on\nthe central Ohio community.\n\nHe said Mount Carmel is conducting at least 300 tests a day at its medical\nfacilities. Those being tested include people showing symptoms and others who\nare asymptomatic but are tested before elective procedures or being admitted\nto a hospital.\n\n\"All three health systems in our community are increasing testing,\"\nKreatsoulas said. \"I know people want to get out now but we must remain\ncautious.\"\n\nCREDIT: LUCAS SULLIVAN; MIKE WAGNER",

    "html": "<p>Increased testing for the coronavirus in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> is not finding a higher rate of people infected with the coronavirus. </p><p>In fact, 94% of people have tested negative in the past 40 days, leading state officials and medical experts to say they are encouraged by Ohio&#8217;s fight against the pandemic. </p><p>But they warn it&#8217;s too soon to celebrate and return to the way life was before the disease spread around the world. </p><p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t let our guard down,&#8221; said Dr. <person value=\"APIN:3077071170\">Bruce Vanderhoff</person>, chief medical officer for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1216237853\">OhioHealth</org>. &#8220;The bigger picture for me is a positive and I am encouraged by the numbers. But as we return to common life we must continue being responsible and do the things we have been doing with social distancing and personal hygiene that helped get us to this point.&#8221; </p><p>The data provided by the <org>Ohio Department of Health</org> through a records request by the Dispatch shows that as of <chron>Memorial Day</chron>, 340,000 tests had been administered since record keeping began by the state on <chron>March 4</chron>. </p><p>That&#8217;s 3 percent of the state&#8217;s population. Ninety percent of the tests were negative. </p><p>Since the state began reopening on <chron>May 1</chron>, 94 percent of those tested were negative. These are new cases, meaning it would not include people who had the virus and recovered. </p><p>That number has held steady since restaurants began reopening on <chron>May 15</chron>. </p><p>Here are the other key findings in the data: </p><p>The state has more than doubled tests given per day compared to what it was in April. Tests given per day in May averaged 7,922 compared to 3,635 per day in April. </p><p>The number of new positive cases have declined steadily from 697 a week in mid-April to 562 the week that ended on <chron>May 23</chron>. </p><p>The percentage of negative tests is increasing. </p><p>Fewer tests are being ordered by doctors. The peak tests ordered by doctors was 10,879 on <chron>May 13</chron>. Since then that number has declined nearly every day. There were 6,791 tests ordered on <chron>May 25</chron>. </p><p>In recent weeks the number of new tests administered has leveled off despite there being more access to tests without a doctor referral. </p><p>At least 15 testing centers in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.colbus\">Columbus</location> area that don&#8217;t require a doctor referral. Many of those testing centers are neighborhood urgent care facilities and said they had been open for testing for at least two to three weeks. </p><p>Gov. <person>Mike DeWine</person> said in April that increased testing would give him another &#8220;tool in the toolbox&#8221; that would allow him to make better decisions. </p><p>&#8220;The more tests you have the better information you can get,&#8221; he said. </p><p>Medical experts said they are encouraged that the number of positive coronavirus cases have been holding or declining the past six weeks. </p><p>But they are worried the public will declare victory against the virus far too soon. </p><p>Dr. <person>Michael Oglesbee</person>, director of the <org>Infectious Diseases Institute</org> at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0296093915\">Ohio State University</org>, said the state needs to test many more Ohioans over an extended time period before making any sweeping statements. </p><p>&#8220;The next two weeks are going to be very informative as to how this all plays out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As we start relaxing some of the measures to prevent infections and including the <chron>Memorial Day</chron> holiday we are going to get some information.&#8221; </p><p>Oglesbee, whose group at <org>Ohio State</org> came up with the projection models Dewine used to make his decisions early on in the pandemic, said there are some positives he sees in the data. </p><p>&#8220;From a trend perspective this is tremendous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have plateaued it appears by the numbers, but you still have to remember people are getting infected.&#8221; </p><p>Vanderhoff said the lull in positive cases is evidence that the state&#8217;s tough decisions that shut down the economy and kept people at home has been effective. </p><p>&#8220;I am convinced the people here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> get it,&#8221; Vanderhoff said. &#8220;We have demonstrated we can act together and do some pretty incredible stuff in a difficult time. This tells us we are doing a good job but have to continue doing a good job as we get our lives back.&#8221; </p><p>State Rep. <person>Paul Zeltwanger</person>, R-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.mason\">Mason</location>, has been critical of DeWine&#8217;s and Acton&#8217;s policies to deal the virus and called them an overreaction. </p><p>Zeltwanger joined another state representative last week in calling for Acton&#8217;s ouster. </p><p>Oglesbee said that until there is a vaccine, the only way to continue the fight against the virus is through herd immunity or social distancing. </p><p>He said since so few Ohioans are testing positive, herd immunity is not an option at this point. </p><p>The doctors also said <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> needs to dramatically increase testing. </p><p>The state ranks 44th in coronavirus testing per 100,000 population, according to data collected and analyzed by <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0843506359\">Johns Hopkins University</org> of Medicine. </p><p>DeWine has said the state has the daily capacity to test double the number tests administered but that isn&#8217;t happening. </p><p>It&#8217;s unclear if that&#8217;s because not enough people are seeking tests, doctors aren&#8217;t recommending them or if other issues remain. </p><p><org>The Ohio Department</org> of health said in an email that in order to use the full testing capacity, there needs to be clear testing guidance on how to use tests to control the virus. The agency said it was reserving some testing to use during expected outbreaks. </p><p>The health department said testing to capacity would also require an &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; to get specimen kits out for testing and back to the labs, which requires a system, something the state doesn&#8217;t have, that would include scheduling, billing and reporting. The agency said it is close to completing a system for that. </p><p><person>Brian Fowler</person>, ODH&#8217;s chief data officer, said a majority of those getting tested are still those presenting symptoms. </p><p>&#8220;We need to have as many tests as we can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know there are positive cases out there we are not catching.&#8221; </p><p>The state has said it has begun testing 1,200 random Ohioans who volunteer to see if they are infected or had been infected at one time with the virus. </p><p>That testing is to determine areas where the disease might have spread or be spreading. </p><p>Ohioans can get tested without a doctor&#8217;s referral. Google has provided a list of testing centers in their area. </p><p>Three urgent care centers contacted by the Dispatch said the tests are <money>$100</money> without insurance, but some policies cover the testing. </p><p>The turnaround time for results is two to three days. </p><p>&#8220;The virus is still there,&#8221; said Dr. <person>Nicholas Kreatsoulas</person>, the chief clinical officer for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2661980117\">Mount Carmel Health System</org>. &#8220;We are not out of the woods yet. We are concerned about a possible surge in the future and people should remain focused daily on how they interact with one another.&#8221; </p><p>Kreatsoulas said that Mount Carmel, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1216237853\">OhioHealth</org> and Ohio State&#8217;s health systems are working together to increase testing and monitoring the virus&#8217; effect on the central <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> community. </p><p>He said Mount Carmel is conducting at least 300 tests a day at its medical facilities. Those being tested include people showing symptoms and others who are asymptomatic but are tested before elective procedures or being admitted to a hospital. </p><p>&#8220;All three health systems in our community are increasing testing,&#8221; Kreatsoulas said. &#8220;I know people want to get out now but we must remain cautious.&#8221; </p><p>CREDIT: <person>LUCAS SULLIVAN</person>; <person>MIKE WAGNER</person></p>",
