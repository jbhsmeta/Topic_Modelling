    "text": "Here's what they are planning: a national health ID. This has been under\ndevelopment by international agencies along with the Gates Foundation for\nseveral years. Planning for this is being done by ID2020, an organization\nsupported by Accenture, the Rockefeller Foundation, Microsoft Corp., the Bill\n& Melinda Gates Foundation, and others. Of note, among the others is an entity\nnamed \"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance,\" whose support of ID2020 demonstrates the\ninterest of would-be globalist regulators in tying vaccination to\nidentification. This is all being built as part of an ongoing effort to force\nall of the world's peoples, Americans not excluded, into a thoroughgoing\ndigital ID scheme.\n\nOf course, this sounds crazy. First, vaccines are always good, aren't they?\nSecond, there has to be some means of tracking who has and has not been\nvaccinated, right? Third, naturally, there needs to be some means of proving\nwho you are. Finally, there can't be some worldwide coordination on all of\nthis, centralizing it and imposing it on everyone without Americans having\ncome to know about it. That would be impossible, right?\n\nWrong. Far removed from the day-today concerns of average Americans,\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and national and international government\nagencies work together to craft policies without notice being given to\ncitizens, without mainstream media reporting, and without legislative\noversight. In this case, for more than a decade these groups have collaborated\non two tracks of tracking and control: a general-purpose digital ID to track\neach of the world's inhabitants, and vaccination-based health IDs to allow\ngovernments and NGOs to track the health of citizens. In the age of COVID-19,\nthe world's would-be technocrat controllers and oligarchs are working to merge\nthis pair of efforts into a single, foundational ID that would be used to\nconstrain and control human activity.\n\nConditioning, Then Control\n\nA first step toward implementing a vaccine-based ID scheme is conditioning\npeople to accept the idea that they will need to prove their vaccination and\nhealth status before being allowed by government to engage in any activities\nthat, heretofore, were exercised without restriction by a free people. This is\nperfect for the age of COVID-19, when mainstream media organs and government\n\"experts\" have worked overtime to instill extreme levels of fear into the\nAmerican people, forcing them into what amounts to house arrest to fight the\n\"war\" on the virus. Now, to regain freedom, it has been suggested that people\nwill need to prove that they have gained immunity to the virus. To this end,\nAnthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump administration's coronavirus\ntask force, admitted that the federal government is considering forcing\ncitizens to use coronavirus immunity cards.\n\n\"You know, that's possible,\" Fauci told CNN. \"I mean, it's one of those things\nthat we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable\npeople are and [are] not,\" he continued. \"This is something that's being\ndiscussed. I think it might actually have some merit, under certain\ncircumstances.\"\n\nImportantly, the idea was also floated by Bill Gates, former head of Microsoft\nand current international supporter of digital ID schemes tied to vaccination.\nDuring an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on the social-media site Reddit, Gates\nsaid he supported using immunity IDs. \"Eventually we will have some digital\ncertificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have\na vaccine who has received it,\" Gates remarked. This is significant, as Gates\nand his foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have been among the\nkey players in the decade-old effort to develop both general-purpose digital\nIDs and vaccine/immunity tracking.\n\nThe constellation of efforts Gates has been making around digital identity and\nvaccination includes funding research at MIT on encoding health and identity\ndata into a quantum-dot based system that can be embedded in the skin.\nDescribed by researchers in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the\nresearchers said they had developed an \"approach to encode medical history on\na patient using the spatial distribution of biocompatible, near-infrared\nquantum dots (NIR QDs) in the dermis. QDs are invisible to the naked eye yet\ndetectable when exposed to NIR light.\"\n\nThe journal translated this into less technical terminology: \"McHugh et al.\ndeveloped dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared\nlight-emitting microparticles to the skin. Particle patterns are invisible to\nthe eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones. By codelivering a\nvaccine, the pattern of particles in the skin could serve as an on-person\nvaccination record.... These results demonstrate proof of concept for\nintradermal on-person vaccination recordkeeping.\"\n\nRecords in scientific journal research databases reveal sources of funding for\nstudies such as this one. In this case, funding was provided by the Bill &\nMelinda Gates Foundation, along with the National Science Foundation, the\nNational Cancer Institute, and the National Institutes of Health here in the\nUnited States. Funding sources also included the Youth Innovation Promotion\nAssociation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Scholarship Council,\nand the National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\nWHO Is the Vaccine ID Granddaddy\n\nFauci and the NIAID have a history of working with the Gates Foundation on\nworldwide vaccination programs. In 2010, the World Health Organization\nlaunched the \"Global Vaccine Action Plan to guide discovery, development and\ndelivery of lifesaving vaccines.\"\n\n\"The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates\nFoundation have announced a collaboration to increase coordination across the\ninternational vaccine community and create a Global Vaccine Action Plan,\" said\nthe WHO press release announcing the plan.\n\nIt continued: \"The collaboration follows the January 2010 call by Bill and\nMelinda Gates for the next ten years to be the Decade of Vaccines. The Global\nVaccine Action Plan will enable greater coordination across all stakeholder\ngroups --national governments, multilateral organizations, civil society, the\nprivate sector and philanthropic organizations--and will identify critical\npolicy, resource, and other gaps that must be addressed to realize the life-\nsaving potential of vaccines.\"\n\nThe leadership council for this initiative included:\n\n* Margaret Chan, director general of WHO;\n\n* Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health;\n\n* Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF;\n\n* Joy Phumaphi, chair of the International Advisory Committee and executive secretary of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance; and\n\n* Tachi Yamada, president of global health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nAmong these names, readers of THE NEW AMERICAN may be familiar with Anthony\nLake, who previously served as national security advisor to President Bill\nClinton. Lake, who had been nominated by Clinton to head the Central\nIntelligence Agency, infamously wasn't sure if notorious Soviet spy Alger Hiss\nwas actually a spy.\n\nAlso noteworthy is Margaret Chan, former longtime leader of the World Health\nOrganization. Before taking the reins of WHO, Chan served as director of\npublic health for Hong Kong. There, in 2004, she came under criticism from the\ncity's Legislative Council for her handling of the original SARS outbreak that\nled to 299 deaths and considerable economic turmoil for the city. Reporting in\n2004, the Hong Kong Standard noted that Chan was \"unanimously condemned\" by\nthe council for what was described as \"dereliction of duty before and during\nthe early stage of the Sars outbreak,\" said Tim Pang from the group Society\nfor Community Organisation, a group representing the interests of SARS victims\nin the city. Chan's inaction \"had a serious impact on public health and global\nhealth, which should disqualify her from working for the WHO,\" Pang concluded,\naccording the Standard.\n\nHer record at WHO, where she gained the top job after being boosted by\nCommunist China, as reported by Politico, was also not without controversy. In\n2009, under her leadership, WHO promoted the idea that the H1N1 swine flu\npandemic would be a worldwide catastrophe. In fact, it proved to be much\nmilder than the WHO health bureaucrats promised, prompting noted German\nphysician and one-time member of the German Parliament Wolfgang Wodarg to note\nin response, \"WHO in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and\ntheir re-defined pandemics ... lowered the alarm threshold.\" The organization\npushed a mass vaccination program for the swine flu, and these vaccines proved\ndangerous in some cases, causing narcolepsy in some, according to Politico.\nThough judged safe by the likes of the CDC, the swine flu vaccine was viewed\nwith increasing suspicion.\n\nChan was also known for her deferential treatment of communism. She appeared\nparticularly fond of North Korea, where she noted, according to Reuters, that\nthere were no signs of obesity and that \"nutrition is an area that the\ngovernment has to pay attention [to] and especially for pregnant women and for\nyoung children.\" This in a country where at least 40 percent of the population\nteeters on the verge of starvation. She also praised the communist\ndictatorship's vaccination programs, Reuters reported. \"They have something\nwhich most other developing countries would envy,\" she said of North Korean\nhealthcare.\n\nMost recently, Chan has worked with Mike Bloomberg's Task Force on Fiscal\nPolicy for Health. That effort resulted in an April 2019 \"study\" calling for\nall nations to raise taxes by 50 percent on sugary soft drinks, alcohol, and\ntobacco. She is now part of the Council of Advisors for the China-based\nglobalist organization the Boao Forum for Asia, run by former UN Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of the People's Bank\nof China, the communist nation's answer to the Federal Reserve. At the Boao\nForum, she is president of the organization's Global Health Forum (GHF). The\nGHF's first annual conference was held in June 2019, and among the\norganization's stated goals was to \"advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment.\" Among a broad menu of other things, that UN program promises by\n2030 to \"provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\" This\nUN program is the framework on which all other world government organizations\nand NGOs are basing their efforts to build health, vaccination, and digital ID\nplans and programs.\n\nIn its documentation, the World Health Organization's Global Vaccine Action\nPlan, led by Chan and Fauci, called for numerous steps, including the use of\nID technologies to track those vaccinated. According to the Global Vaccine\nAction Plan 2011-2020 summary available as a PDF from WHO: \"Reaching every\ncommunity will call for an understanding of the barriers to access and use of\nimmunization; it will also require the underserved to be identified, and\nmicro-plans at the district and community levels to be reviewed and revised in\norder to ensure that these barriers can be overcome. The rapid expansion of\ninformation technology should be leveraged to establish immunization\nregistries and electronic databases that will allow each individual's\nimmunization status to be tracked, timely reminders to be sent when\nimmunization is due and data to be accessed easily to inform actions. The\nintroduction of unique identification numbers could be a catalyst for the\nestablishment of such systems.\"\n\nSchemes for Global ID Control\n\nTying vaccine and health data to identification documentation is a twist on an\nalready elaborate, emerging constellation of efforts to subjugate the\npopulation of the entire world using a universal digital ID.\n\nIn a 2019 paper, the McKinsey Global Institute (McKinsey) described how a\ndigital ID would take the place of traditional paper IDs. The organization\nworked with all of the leading players in the development of these ID schemes.\n\"Our understanding of good ID was informed by extensive consultations with our\nresearch collaboration partners Omidyar Network, the Open Society Foundations,\nand the Rockefeller Foundation,\" said the McKinsey report. \"We also conducted\nin-depth discussions on the opportunities and challenges associated with\ndigital ID with experts from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Center\nfor Global Development, iSPIRT, the United Nations Development Programme, the\nWorld Bank Group's ID4D initiative, and the World Economic Forum.\"\n\nThis is a rogues' gallery of NGOs if there ever was one. The Omidyar Network,\nfor instance, thinks capitalism should be \"reimagined,\" which is code for\nbeing \"managed\" by planners to \"rebalance power,\" shifting it from markets to\nthe state and from businesses to workers' groups in such a way as to\nexplicitly undermine free market economics, which the organization identifies\nwith its bogeyman, the \"Milton Friedman-Friedrich Hayek paradigm.\"\n\nIn addition to the Omidyar Network, the Open Society Foundations from\ninternationalist mastermind George Soros is the chief NGO involved in the\ndisruption of national sovereignty worldwide, while the Rockefeller Foundation\nhas a deep history of dangerous subversion of individual dignity and rights.\nThe latter organization, to point to just one disturbing example, played a key\nrole in the perpetuation of the eugenics scheme worldwide, including in Nazi\nGermany. This, of course, sounds preposterous to those unfamiliar with this\nbit of hidden history. But as pioneering journalist Edwin Black, author of\nseveral books on the eugenics movement and Nazi Germany, points out, \"The\nRockefeller Foundation helped found the German eugenics program and even\nfunded the program that Josef Mengele worked in before he went to Auschwitz.\"\n\nThese are some of the key organizations that now want to be trusted to guide\nthe creation of a world scheme of digital identification.\n\nBased on their discussions with these and other organizations behind the\nscheme, McKinsey reported that a \"good ID\" (a euphemism preferred by the\nOmidyar Network) would be authenticated digitally, and could be issued by \"a\nnational or local government, by a consortium of private or nonprofit\norganizations, or by an individual entity.\" Technologies used for\nauthentication, McKinsey wrote, could include everything from \"biometric data\nto passwords, PINs, or smart devices and security tokens.\"\n\nBuilding a digital ID platform, McKinsey notes, is needed in order to reach\nthe goals outlined by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment\\--the same program guiding the efforts of Margaret Chan's Global\nHealth Forum.\n\nDescribing digital ID as an opportunity--the main theme of the report--\nMcKinsey pointed directly to the UN program, arguing that the world body's\n\"Sustainable Development Goals promote legal identity for all, especially\nbirth registration, by 2030. Furthermore, digital ID is increasingly seen as a\nprerequisite to participate in the digital economy, for example in digital\nfinance. Digital inclusion is considered so important to promote economic\ndevelopment that the United Nations has highlighted digital inclusion as a key\nenabler for 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\"\n\nThat last bit is promoted by those behind the digital ID schemes as a benefit.\nPeople provided with these new digital talismans will be able to get\nfinancing, secure jobs, purchase products, participate in democracy, and so\nforth, according to the prevailing propaganda.\n\nBut the reverse is also true. Without the digital ID, freedom will be revoked.\nThere will be no freedom to work for a living, to purchase property, to move\nabout freely, or to trade for goods or services. The digital ID is, in fact, a\nscheme to restrict or eliminate individual freedom outright and to provide it\nonly on the authority of some NGO or government agency.\n\nTurn over enough rocks and you'll find some of those behind the push for a\ndigital ID admitting that the scheme is actually about controlling people and\nbehavior. While pushing for adoption of digital IDs, McKinsey admits: \"Without\nproper controls, digital ID system administrators with nefarious aims, whether\nthey work for private-sector firms or governments, would gain access to and\ncontrol over data. History provides ugly examples of misuse of traditional\nidentification programs, including tracking or persecuting ethnic and\nreligious groups. Digital ID, if improperly designed, could be used in yet\nmore targeted ways against the interests of individuals or groups by\ngovernment or the private sector. Potential motivations could include\nfinancial profit from the collection and storage of personal data, political\nmanipulation of an electorate, and social control of particular groups through\nsurveillance and restriction of access to uses such as payments, travel, and\nsocial media.\"\n\nOne of the companies building the technological infrastructure for digital ID\nschemes is arms manufacturer and security firm Thales Group. Partially owned\nby the French government, the key division of Thales working on Digital ID is\nGemalto, a formerly independent company that Thales acquired in 2017 for $5.4\nbillion.\n\nAs with every other participant in the digital ID scheme, Gemalto points to\nits alignment with the UN's goals in its literature on building a digital ID.\nAnd it admits that a future digital identity will be necessary for individuals\nto engage in activities that, today, don't require an ID. \"Without a robust\nmeans of proving one's identity, exercising one's basic rights, claiming\nentitlements, accessing a range of governmental services, and conducting many\ndaily activities could be hampered,\" Gemalto warns.\n\nIt should be noted that this is not something coming in the distant, far-off\nfuture. Digital IDs are already being implemented. For just one example, in\nJuly 2019, Thales launched the Gemalto Digital ID Wallet. In a press release\nthe company described the function of this technology:\n\n    \n    \n    With Thales's new Gemalto Digital\n       ID Wallet, governments will issue\n       a secure digital version of official\n       documents including identity cards,\n       health cards and drivers licenses,\n       available to all citizens on their\n       smartphones. Citizens will therefore\n       be able to prove who they are, both\n       online and in the \"real world,\" and\n       access their rights and services at\n       the touch of a button. The solution\n       uses multi-layered security techniques\n       and sophisticated encryption\n       to achieve robust protection of\n       personal data, whilst offering users\n       complete control over what information\n       they choose to share, with\n       whom, and when.\n\nSolutions such as this would invariably be tied to various databases housing\ninformation about each person. It is a trivial matter to include in such\ndatabases information about credit scores, consumer behavior, and more. In\nChina, the population is increasingly controlled by the communist regime's\n\"social credit score.\" Writing for Digital Trends in 2018, Luke Dormehl\npointed out that the West is closer to China's system than many think. Of\nChina's Orwellian plan, he wrote: \"In addition to more mundane areas like\nwhether you pay your community charge on time, the system's reputational\nalgorithm will also factor in your choice of online friends. That person who\ncomplains about how the government is doing its job could suddenly cost you\nsome serious social cred. Befriend too many wrongthinkers and you could\nquickly find yourself classed as a wrongthinker too.\"\n\nIt's disturbing, and it's not going to be confined to China. \"It's an idea\nstraight out of the oft-invoked George Orwell dystopia Nineteen Eighty-Four,\"\nDormehl continued. \"But it's also not wholly unique to China. True, the U.S.\ngovernment isn't publicly instituting a Social Credit System, but the idea\nthat digital reputation analysis isn't something that affects us all in 2018\nis patently untrue.\"\n\nWhile somewhat informal and dispersed today in America, a worldwide digital ID\nwould offer the planet's would-be ruling class--the international \"Deep State\"\nif you will--the opportunity to roll out a communist China-like system for\neveryone, offering a level of control over people never before possible, or\neven dreamed of by tyrants of the past.\n\nThe Health ID Scheme\n\nOne of the key international organizations working to integrate digital ID and\nhealth ID is the World Bank, through its Identification for Development (ID4D)\nscheme. In 2018, the world financial body revealed in a report on its ID4D\ninitiatives that it was receiving key support from certain governments and\nfrom a pair of the internationalist and subversive NGOs that are prominent\nthroughout the movement to shackle the world's people to an ID control scheme.\n\"The work of ID4D is made possible through support from the World Bank Group,\nthe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Government, the Australian\nGovernment and the Omidyar Network,\" the World Bank report notes.\n\nThe World Bank calls for the linking of a health ID with existing national IDs\ninto a resulting, all-encompassing digital ID called a \"foundational\nidentification.\"\n\n\"Integration between foundational identification and healthcare systems has\nthe potential to not only improve the delivery of health services and public\nhealth management, but also to strengthen identification systems themselves,\"\nthe World Bank report notes. \"This is particularly the case where there are\nstrong linkages between identification and civil registration systems, the\nlatter of which already relies on the health sector for birth and death\nregistration. Incorporating foundational systems into healthcare can\nstrengthen and streamline these processes and create further demand for\nidentity documents and civil registration.\"\n\nOn the latter point, generating citizen demand for more ID documents, the\nWorld Bank report is slyly admitting that demand for IDs will be driven by\nrestricting services to only those who already have the ID required. \"Where a\nunique foundational identifier is required to enroll in or access health\nservices, it may increase incentives to obtain the ID, as in Estonia and\nIndia,\" the report notes. Again, that's because without the new ID, citizens\nwould be prevented from accessing services.\n\nOf course, the World Bank's 2018 report also pointed out that a \"foundational\nidentification\" scheme that incorporates health ID would be \"useful\" during\nhealth emergencies. \"Stronger vital statistics generated by CR [civil\nregistration] systems also benefit public health by improving the accuracy and\ntimeliness of important indicators --e.g., mortality, morbidity, maternal and\nchild health, etc.--used in health policy and planning and emergency response\nto disease outbreaks,\" the organization says.\n\nPopulation Control\n\nAs if tracking and controlling people isn't bad enough, there may be a more\nsinister population-control plan afoot. Speaking at a TED conference in 2010\non the subject of cutting carbon emissions to prevent global warming, Bill\nGates pointed to population control as one area where an impact could be made.\nAmong other things, he singled out vaccination as having a role in population\ncontrol.\n\n\"First we've got population,\" Gates began. \"The world today has 6.8 billion\npeople. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great\njob on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower\nthat by, perhaps 10 or 15 percent.\"\n\nNow, most people make the reasonable conclusion that vaccines, making people\nless prone to disease and, therefore, healthier, promote population stability,\nif not outright growth. But Gates, quite curiously, tied vaccines to\npopulation control in this talk.\n\nSubsequently, Melinda Gates attempted to explain his counterintuitive\nphilosophy on vaccines for population control. In the couple's 2017 Annual\nLetter, she wrote: \"Saving children's lives is the goal that launched our\nglobal work. It's an end in itself. But then we learned it has all these other\nbenefits as well. If parents believe their children will survive--and if they\nhave the power to time and space their pregnancies--they choose to have fewer\nchildren.\"\n\nCredible but also creditably disputed claims, especially in Kenya, that some\nGates-related vaccines intervened in human reproduction aside, Gates and his\norganization are interested in population control. Their work for a decade or\nmore on tying vaccination to identification is clearly part of this agenda.\nEven taking the generous position of assigning to Gates the possibility that\nhe is attempting to simply improve childhood health and reduce poverty does\nnot remove or make illegitimate concerns about using vaccination and health\nIDs to track the world's population, as such a scheme creates a system of\ncontrol for population technocrats to direct the lives of billions of people\nin a power grab of unimaginable proportions --and consequences.\n\nAt least not everyone in the Trump administration is simply going along with\nthe internationalist plan for the implementation of health IDs.\n\nSpeaking to Laura Ingraham on Fox News, Attorney General Bill Barr said he\ndidn't like the idea of vaccine IDs and certificates to prove immunity to\nCOVID-19.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about the slippery slope in terms of continuing\nencroachments on personal liberty. I do think during the emergency,\nappropriate, reasonable steps are fine,\" Barr said when asked about vaccine\ncertificates. Asked for more specifics, he continued: \"I'd be a little\nconcerned about that, the tracking of people and so forth, generally,\nespecially going forward over a long period of time.\"\n\nOpposition aside, if technocrats such as Gates achieve their aims, Americans\nwill not be able to shop, work, travel, or do anything else without their\nvaccine/ health ID, which will almost certainly end up in some sort of\ntechnological and possibly injectable form. This likely would then be combined\nin the future with your credit score and other social scores, becoming an all-\nencompassing tracking and management technology for the world's population.\n\nKeep in mind, too, the very important point that plans for a digital ID\nimposed worldwide are not schemes for the far-distant future. The UN\ndevelopment goals motivating the construction of the ID scheme call for\nimplementation by 2030, just a decade away. But already, much of the\ninfrastructure is in place.\n\nFrom Thales and Gemalto already launching digital ID wallets, to pilot\nprojects in places such as Bangladesh and early digital ID operations in\nEstonia and India, to name just two of many, the electronic control trap is\nready to spring.\n\n\"The technology sector is on a mission to equip everyone on the planet with a\ndigital and online presence,\" wrote Gavi Vaccine Alliance CEO Seth Berkely in\nNature in 2017. \"One of the biggest needs is for affordable, secure digital\nidentification systems that can store a child's medical history, and that can\nbe accessed even in places without reliable electricity. That might seem a\ntall order, but it is both achievable and necessary,\" he concluded.\n\nAgain, Berkely was writing in 2017. The scheme has made great strides since\nthen, and a pandemic is just what is needed to scare a fearful populace into\nsubmission.\n\nContrary to what the Deep State schemers and planners claim, people receive\nneither legitimacy nor identity from an NGO- or government-administered\ndatabase or tracking system. Each person's natural rights are inherent in\ntheir humanity and cannot be subjected in any legitimate way to control,\nmanagement, and regulation by some oligarchic international bureaucracy.\n\nA digital ID scheme is nothing more than a means of tracking personal activity\nand limiting and regulating access and behavior. It is antithetical to a free\npeople. That the plans for this have been and continue to be made at\ninternational conferences and behind the closed doors of international\nagencies and NGOs, unreported by the media and without citizen knowledge or\nassent, tells you much about their essential nature.\n\nTechnocrat oligarchs and planners are not looking to emancipate the peoples of\nthe world, but to enslave and control them. Don't let them.\n\nLive free--oppose the ID!\n\nWHO: \"The rapid expansion of information technology should be leveraged to\nestablish immunization registries and electronic databases that will allow\neach individual's immunization status to be tracked.\"\n\nDennis Behreandt works in the chemical technology industry and has served as\nan editor for several publications, including THE NEW AMERICAN.\n\nCaption: Dr. Anthony Fauci: A key member of President Trump's coronavirus task\nforce, Dr. Fauci has speculated that Americans will need to have immunity\ncards to prove they are virus-free before they can regain some of their lost\nfreedoms.\n\nCaption: Bill Gates: The billionaire former head of Microsoft Corp. now leads\na worldwide, multifaceted effort to develop vaccines, vaccine IDs, and\ncentralized digital ID schemes to be used to manage and control the world's\npopulation.\n\nCaption: Margaret Chan; Former head of the World Health Organization, Chan now\nleads the Global Health Forum, an organization dedicated to achieving the\ngoals put forth by the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

People saddled with a centralized\ndigital ID by some governing body would no longer be free and possessed of the\nunalienable human rights described by Thomas Jefferson, but would instead be\nreduced to a mere herd of livestock to be managed and controlled by\ninternational technocrats.",

Planning for this is being done by ID2020,\nan organization supported by Accenture, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2138737528\">Rockefeller Foundation</org>,\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:MSFT\">Microsoft Corp.</org>, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1760887732\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</org>, and others. Of\nnote, among the others is an entity named \"Gavi, the <org>Vaccine\nAlliance</org>,\" whose support of ID2020 demonstrates the interest of\nwould-be globalist regulators in tying vaccination to identification.\nThis is all being built as part of an ongoing effort to force all of the\nworld's peoples, Americans not excluded, into a thoroughgoing\ndigital ID scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this sounds crazy. First, vaccines are always good,\naren't they? Second, there has to be some means of tracking <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> has\nand has not been vaccinated, right? Third, naturally, there needs to be\nsome means of proving <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> you are. Finally, there can't be some\nworldwide coordination on all of this, centralizing it and imposing it\non everyone without Americans having come to know about it. That would\nbe impossible, right?</p>\n\n<p>Wrong. Far removed from the day-today concerns of average\nAmericans, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and national and\ninternational government agencies work together to craft policies\nwithout notice being given to citizens, without mainstream media\nreporting, and without legislative oversight. In this case, for more\nthan a decade these groups have collaborated on two tracks of tracking\nand control: a general-purpose digital ID to track each of the\nworld's inhabitants, and vaccination-based health IDs to allow\ngovernments and NGOs to track the health of citizens. In the age of\nCOVID-19, the world's would-be technocrat controllers and oligarchs\nare working to merge this pair of efforts into a single, foundational ID\nthat would be used to constrain and control human activity.</p>\n\n<p>Conditioning, Then Control</p>\n\n<p>A first step toward implementing a vaccine-based ID scheme is\nconditioning people to accept the idea that they will need to prove\ntheir vaccination and health status before being allowed by government\nto engage in any activities that, heretofore, were exercised without\nrestriction by a free people. This is perfect for the age of COVID-19,\nwhen mainstream media organs and government \"experts\" have\nworked overtime to instill extreme levels of fear into the American\npeople, forcing them into what amounts to house arrest to fight the\n\"war\" on the virus. Now, to regain freedom, it has been\nsuggested that people will need to prove that they have gained immunity\nto the virus. To this end, <person value=\"APIN:0999679393\">Anthony Fauci</person>, the head of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2992201491\">National\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</org> (NIAID) and a key member of\nthe Trump administration's coronavirus task force, admitted that\nthe federal government is considering forcing citizens to use\ncoronavirus immunity cards.</p>\n\n<p>\"You know, that's possible,\" Fauci told CNN. \"I\nmean, it's one of those things that we talk about when we want to\nmake sure that we know <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> the vulnerable people are and [are]\nnot,\" he continued. \"This is something that's being\ndiscussed. I think it might actually have some merit, under certain\ncircumstances.\"</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the idea was also floated by <person value=\"APIN:3523862123\">Bill Gates</person>, former head\nof Microsoft and current international supporter of digital ID schemes\ntied to vaccination. During an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on\nthe social-media site Reddit, Gates said he supported using immunity\nIDs. \"Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org>\nhas recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> has\nreceived it,\" Gates remarked. This is significant, as Gates and his\nfoundation, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1760887732\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</org>, have been among the\nkey players in the decade-old effort to develop both general-purpose\ndigital IDs and vaccine/immunity tracking.</p>\n\n<p>The constellation of efforts Gates has been making around digital\nidentity and vaccination includes funding research at <org>MIT</org> on encoding\nhealth and identity data into a quantum-dot based system that can be\nembedded in the skin. Described by researchers in the journal Science\nTranslational Medicine, the researchers said they had developed an\n\"approach to encode medical history on a patient using the spatial\ndistribution of biocompatible, near-infrared quantum dots (NIR QDs) in\nthe dermis. QDs are invisible to the naked eye yet detectable when\nexposed to NIR light.\"</p>\n\n<p>The journal translated this into less technical terminology:\n\"McHugh et al. developed dissolvable microneedles that deliver\npatterns of near-infrared light-emitting microparticles to the skin.\nParticle patterns are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using\nmodified smartphones. By codelivering a vaccine, the pattern of\nparticles in the skin could serve as an on-person vaccination record....\nThese results demonstrate proof of concept for intradermal on-person\nvaccination recordkeeping.\"</p>\n\n<p>Records in scientific journal research databases reveal sources of\nfunding for studies such as this one. In this case, funding was provided\nby the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1760887732\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</org>, along with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1037221827\">National\nScience Foundation</org>, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6000176586\">National Cancer Institute</org>, and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1965594450\">National\nInstitutes of Health</org> here in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>.

Before taking the reins of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">WHO</org>, Chan served\nas director of public health for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location>. There, in 2004, she came\nunder criticism from the city's <org>Legislative Council</org> for her\nhandling of the original SARS outbreak that led to 299 deaths and\nconsiderable economic turmoil for the city. Reporting in 2004, the Hong\nKong Standard noted that Chan was \"unanimously condemned\" by\nthe council for what was described as \"dereliction of duty before\nand during the early stage of the Sars outbreak,\" said <person>Tim Pang</person>\nfrom the group <org>Society for Community Organisation</org>, a group representing\nthe interests of SARS victims in the city. Chan's inaction\n\"had a serious impact on public health and global health, which\nshould disqualify her from working for the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">WHO</org>,\" Pang concluded,\naccording the Standard.</p>\n\n<p>Her record at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">WHO</org>, where she gained the top job after being boosted\nby Communist China, as reported by <org>Politico</org>, was also not without\ncontroversy. In 2009, under her leadership, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">WHO</org> promoted the idea that\nthe H1N1 swine flu pandemic would be a worldwide catastrophe.

Though judged safe by the likes of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">CDC</org>, the swine flu\nvaccine was viewed with increasing suspicion.</p>\n\n<p>Chan was also known for her deferential treatment of communism. She\nappeared particularly fond of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/kp\">North Korea</location>, where she noted, according to\nReuters, that there were no signs of obesity and that \"nutrition is\nan area that the government has to pay attention [to] and especially for\npregnant women and for young children.\" This in a country where at\nleast 40 percent of the population teeters on the verge of starvation.\nShe also praised the communist dictatorship's vaccination programs,\nReuters reported. \"They have something which most other developing\ncountries would envy,\" she said of North Korean healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>Most recently, Chan has worked with <person>Mike Bloomberg's</person> <org>Task\nForce on Fiscal Policy for Health</org>. That effort resulted in an <chron>April 2019</chron>\n\"study\" calling for all nations to raise taxes by 50 percent\non sugary soft drinks, alcohol, and tobacco. She is now part of the\nCouncil of Advisors for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>-based globalist organization the <org>Boao\nForum for Asia</org>, run by former <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">UN</org> Secretary-General <person value=\"APIN:1847150958\">Ban Ki-moon</person> and <person value=\"APIN:1652141566\">Zhou\nXiaochuan</person>, former governor of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1915898349\">People's Bank of China</org>, the\ncommunist nation's answer to the <org>Federal Reserve</org>. At the <org>Boao\nForum</org>, she is president of the organization's <org>Global Health Forum</org>\n(GHF). The GHF's first annual conference was held in <chron>June 2019</chron>, and\namong the organization's stated goals was to \"advance the 2030\nAgenda for <org>Sustainable Development</org>.\" Among a broad menu of other\nthings, that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">UN</org> program promises by 2030 to \"provide legal identity\nfor all, including birth registration.\" This <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">UN</org> program is the\nframework on which all other world government organizations and NGOs are\nbasing their efforts to build health, vaccination, and digital ID plans\nand programs.</p>\n\n<p>In its documentation, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">World Health Organization's</org> Global\nVaccine Action Plan, led by Chan and Fauci, called for numerous steps,\nincluding the use of ID technologies to track those vaccinated.\nAccording to the Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 summary available\nas a PDF from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">WHO</org>: \"Reaching every community will call for an\nunderstanding of the barriers to access and use of immunization; it will\nalso require the underserved to be identified, and micro-plans at the\ndistrict and community levels to be reviewed and revised in order to\nensure that these barriers can be overcome. The rapid expansion of\ninformation technology should be leveraged to establish immunization\nregistries and electronic databases that will allow each\nindividual's immunization status to be tracked, timely reminders to\nbe sent when immunization is due and data to be accessed easily to\ninform actions. The introduction of unique identification numbers could\nbe a catalyst for the establishment of such systems.\"</p>\n\n<p>Schemes for Global ID Control</p>\n\n<p>Tying vaccine and health data to identification documentation is a\ntwist on an already elaborate, emerging constellation of efforts to\nsubjugate the population of the entire world using a universal digital\nID.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2019 paper, the <org>McKinsey Global Institute</org> (McKinsey) described\nhow a digital ID would take the place of traditional paper IDs. The\norganization worked with all of the leading players in the development\nof these ID schemes. \"Our understanding of good ID was informed by\nextensive consultations with our research collaboration partners Omidyar\nNetwork, the <org>Open Society Foundations</org>, and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2138737528\">Rockefeller\nFoundation</org>,\" said the McKinsey report. \"We also conducted\nin-depth discussions on the opportunities and challenges associated with\ndigital ID with experts from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1760887732\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</org>,\nthe <org>Center for Global Development</org>, iSPIRT, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3369619786\">World Bank Group's</org> ID4D initiative, and\nthe <org>World Economic Forum</org>.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is a rogues' gallery of NGOs if there ever was one. The\nOmidyar Network, for instance, thinks capitalism should be\n\"reimagined,\" which is code for being \"managed\" by\nplanners to \"rebalance power,\" shifting it from markets to the\nstate and from businesses to workers' groups in such a way as to\nexplicitly undermine free market economics, which the organization\nidentifies with its bogeyman, the \"<person>Milton Friedman-Friedrich Hayek</person>\nparadigm.\"</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the Omidyar Network, the <org>Open Society Foundations</org>\nfrom internationalist mastermind <person>George Soros</person> is the chief NGO involved\nin the disruption of national sovereignty worldwide, while the\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2138737528\">Rockefeller Foundation</org> has a deep history of dangerous subversion of\nindividual dignity and rights. The latter organization, to point to just\none disturbing example, played a key role in the perpetuation of the\neugenics scheme worldwide, including in Nazi <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>. This, of course,\nsounds preposterous to those unfamiliar with this bit of hidden history.\nBut as pioneering journalist <person>Edwin Black</person>, author of several books on the\neugenics movement and Nazi <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>, points out, \"<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2138737528\">The Rockefeller\nFoundation</org> helped found the German eugenics program and even funded the\nprogram that <person>Josef Mengele</person> worked in before he went to Auschwitz.\"</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the key organizations that now want to be trusted\nto guide the creation of a world scheme of digital identification.</p>\n\n<p>Based on their discussions with these and other organizations\nbehind the scheme, McKinsey reported that a \"good ID\" (a\neuphemism preferred by the Omidyar Network) would be authenticated\ndigitally, and could be issued by \"a national or local government,\nby a consortium of private or nonprofit organizations, or by an\nindividual entity.\" Technologies used for authentication, McKinsey\nwrote, could include everything from \"biometric data to passwords,\nPINs, or smart devices and security tokens.\"</p>\n\n<p>Building a digital ID platform, McKinsey notes, is needed in order\nto reach the goals outlined by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">United Nations</org> 2030 Agenda for\n<org>Sustainable Development</org>--the same program guiding the efforts of\n<person value=\"APIN:2864447008\">Margaret Chan's</person> <org>Global Health Forum</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Describing digital ID as an opportunity--the main theme of the\nreport--McKinsey pointed directly to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">UN</org> program, arguing that the\nworld body's \"<org>Sustainable Development Goals</org> promote legal\nidentity for all, especially birth registration, by 2030. Furthermore,\ndigital ID is increasingly seen as a prerequisite to participate in the\ndigital economy, for example in digital finance. Digital inclusion is\nconsidered so important to promote economic development that the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">United\nNations</org> has highlighted digital inclusion as a key enabler for 13 of the\n17 <org>Sustainable Development Goals</org>.\"</p>\n\n<p>That last bit is promoted by those behind the digital ID schemes as\na benefit. People provided with these new digital talismans will be able\nto get financing, secure jobs, purchase products, participate in\ndemocracy, and so forth, according to the prevailing propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>But the reverse is also true. Without the digital ID, freedom will\nbe revoked. There will be no freedom to work for a living, to purchase\nproperty, to move about freely, or to trade for goods or services. The\ndigital ID is, in fact, a scheme to restrict or eliminate individual\nfreedom outright and to provide it only on the authority of some NGO or\ngovernment agency.</p>\n\n<p>Turn over enough rocks and you'll find some of those behind\nthe push for a digital ID admitting that the scheme is actually about\ncontrolling people and behavior. While pushing for adoption of digital\nIDs, McKinsey admits: \"Without proper controls, digital ID system\nadministrators with nefarious aims, whether they work for private-sector\nfirms or governments, would gain access to and control over data.\nHistory provides ugly examples of misuse of traditional identification\nprograms, including tracking or persecuting ethnic and religious groups.\nDigital ID, if improperly designed, could be used in yet more targeted\nways against the interests of individuals or groups by government or the\nprivate sector. Potential motivations could include financial profit\nfrom the collection and storage of personal data, political manipulation\nof an electorate, and social control of particular groups through\nsurveillance and restriction of access to uses such as payments, travel,\nand social media.\"</p>\n\n<p>One of the companies building the technological infrastructure for\ndigital ID schemes is arms manufacturer and security firm <org>Thales Group</org>.\nPartially owned by the French government, the key division of Thales\nworking on Digital ID is <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Vienna:GTO\">Gemalto</org>, a formerly independent company that\nThales acquired in 2017 for <money>$5.4 billion</money>.</p>\n\n<p>As with every other participant in the digital ID scheme, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Vienna:GTO\">Gemalto</org>\npoints to its alignment with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">UN</org>'s goals in its literature on\nbuilding a digital ID. And it admits that a future digital identity will\nbe necessary for individuals to engage in activities that, today,\ndon't require an ID. \"Without a robust means of proving\none's identity, exercising one's basic rights, claiming\nentitlements, accessing a range of governmental services, and conducting\nmany daily activities could be hampered,\" <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Vienna:GTO\">Gemalto</org> warns.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this is not something coming in the\ndistant, far-off future. Digital IDs are already being implemented. For\njust one example, in <chron>July 2019</chron>, Thales launched the Gemalto Digital ID\nWallet. In a press release the company described the function of this\ntechnology:</p>\n\n<pre>With Thales's new Gemalto Digital\n   ID Wallet, governments will issue\n   a secure digital version of official\n   documents including identity cards,\n   health cards and drivers licenses,\n   available to all citizens on their\n   smartphones. Citizens will therefore\n   be able to prove <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> they are, both\n   online and in the \"real world,\" and\n   access their rights and services at\n   the touch of a button. The solution\n   uses multi-layered security techniques\n   and sophisticated encryption\n   to achieve robust protection of\n   personal data, whilst offering users\n   complete control over what information\n   they choose to share, with\n   whom, and when.</pre>\n\n<p>Solutions such as this would invariably be tied to various\ndatabases housing information about each person. It is a trivial matter\nto include in such databases information about credit scores, consumer\nbehavior, and more. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, the population is increasingly controlled\nby the communist regime's \"social credit score.\" Writing\nfor Digital Trends in 2018, Luke Dormehl pointed out that the West is\ncloser to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location> system than many think. Of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location> Orwellian\nplan, he wrote: \"In addition to more mundane areas like whether you\npay your community charge on time, the system's reputational\nalgorithm will also factor in your choice of online friends. That person\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> complains about how the government is doing its job could suddenly\ncost you some serious social cred. Befriend too many wrongthinkers and\nyou could quickly find yourself classed as a wrongthinker too.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's disturbing, and it's not going to be confined to\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. \"It's an idea straight out of the oft-invoked George\nOrwell dystopia <chron>Nineteen Eighty-Four</chron>,\" Dormehl continued. \"But\nit's also not wholly unique to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>. True, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> government\nisn't publicly instituting a Social Credit System, but the idea\nthat digital reputation analysis isn't something that affects us\nall in 2018 is patently untrue.\"</p>\n\n<p>While somewhat informal and dispersed today in America, a worldwide\ndigital ID would offer the planet's would-be ruling class--the\ninternational \"Deep State\" if you will--the opportunity to\nroll out a communist <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>-like system for everyone, offering a level of\ncontrol over people never before possible, or even dreamed of by tyrants\nof the past.</p>\n\n<p>The Health ID Scheme</p>\n\n<p>One of the key international organizations working to integrate\ndigital ID and health ID is the <org>World Bank</org>, through its Identification\nfor Development (ID4D) scheme. In 2018, the world financial body\nrevealed in a report on its ID4D initiatives that it was receiving key\nsupport from certain governments and from a pair of the internationalist\nand subversive NGOs that are prominent throughout the movement to\nshackle the world's people to an ID control scheme. \"The work\nof ID4D is made possible through support from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3369619786\">World Bank Group</org>, the\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1760887732\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</org>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> Government, the Australian\nGovernment and the Omidyar Network,\" the <org>World Bank</org> report notes.</p>\n\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3369619786\">The World Bank</org> calls for the linking of a health ID with existing\nnational IDs into a resulting, all-encompassing digital ID called a\n\"foundational identification.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Integration between foundational identification and\nhealthcare systems has the potential to not only improve the delivery of\nhealth services and public health management, but also to strengthen\nidentification systems themselves,\" the <org>World Bank</org> report notes.\n\"This is particularly the case where there are strong linkages\nbetween identification and civil registration systems, the latter of\nwhich already relies on the health sector for birth and death\nregistration. Incorporating foundational systems into healthcare can\nstrengthen and streamline these processes and create further demand for\nidentity documents and civil registration.\"</p>\n\n<p>On the latter point, generating citizen demand for more ID\ndocuments, the <org>World Bank</org> report is slyly admitting that demand for IDs\nwill be driven by restricting services to only those <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> already have\nthe ID required. \"Where a unique foundational identifier is\nrequired to enroll in or access health services, it may increase\nincentives to obtain the ID, as in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ee\">Estonia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>,\" the report\nnotes. Again, that's because without the new ID, citizens would be\nprevented from accessing services.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the <org>World Bank's</org> 2018 report also pointed out that\na \"foundational identification\" scheme that incorporates\nhealth ID would be \"useful\" during health emergencies.\n\"Stronger vital statistics generated by CR [civil registration]\nsystems also benefit public health by improving the accuracy and\ntimeliness of important indicators --e.g., mortality, morbidity,\nmaternal and child health, etc.--used in health policy and planning and\nemergency response to disease outbreaks,\" the organization says.</p>\n\n<p>Population Control</p>\n\n<p>As if tracking and controlling people isn't bad enough, there\nmay be a more sinister population-control plan afoot. Speaking at a TED\nconference in 2010 on the subject of cutting carbon emissions to prevent\nglobal warming, <person value=\"APIN:3523862123\">Bill Gates</person> pointed to population control as one area\nwhere an impact could be made. Among other things, he singled out\nvaccination as having a role in population control.</p>\n\n<p>\"First we've got population,\" Gates began. \"The\nworld today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine\nbillion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care,\nreproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps 10 or 15\npercent.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, most people make the reasonable conclusion that vaccines,\nmaking people less prone to disease and, therefore, healthier, promote\npopulation stability, if not outright growth. But Gates, quite\ncuriously, tied vaccines to population control in this talk.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequently, Melinda Gates attempted to explain his\ncounterintuitive philosophy on vaccines for population control. In the\ncouple's 2017 Annual Letter, she wrote: \"Saving\nchildren's lives is the goal that launched our global work.\nIt's an end in itself. But then we learned it has all these other\nbenefits as well. If parents believe their children will survive--and if\nthey have the power to time and space their pregnancies--they choose to\nhave fewer children.\"</p>\n\n<p>Credible but also creditably disputed claims, especially in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ke\">Kenya</location>,\nthat some Gates-related vaccines intervened in human reproduction aside,\nGates and his organization are interested in population control. Their\nwork for a decade or more on tying vaccination to identification is\nclearly part of this agenda. Even taking the generous position of\nassigning to Gates the possibility that he is attempting to simply\nimprove childhood health and reduce poverty does not remove or make\nillegitimate concerns about using vaccination and health IDs to track\nthe world's population, as such a scheme creates a system of\ncontrol for population technocrats to direct the lives of billions of\npeople in a power grab of unimaginable proportions --and consequences.</p>\n\n<p>At least not everyone in the Trump administration is simply going\nalong with the internationalist plan for the implementation of health\nIDs.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to <person>Laura Ingraham</person> on <org>Fox News</org>, Attorney General <person>Bill Barr</person>\nsaid he didn't like the idea of vaccine IDs and certificates to\nprove immunity to COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm very concerned about the slippery slope in terms of\ncontinuing encroachments on personal liberty. I do think during the\nemergency, appropriate, reasonable steps are fine,\" Barr said when\nasked about vaccine certificates. Asked for more specifics, he\ncontinued: \"I'd be a little concerned about that, the tracking\nof people and so forth, generally, especially going forward over a long\nperiod of time.\"</p>\n\n<p>Opposition aside, if technocrats such as Gates achieve their aims,\nAmericans will not be able to shop, work, travel, or do anything else\nwithout their vaccine/ health ID, which will almost certainly end up in\nsome sort of technological and possibly injectable form. This likely\nwould then be combined in the future with your credit score and other\nsocial scores, becoming an all-encompassing tracking and management\ntechnology for the world's population.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, too, the very important point that plans for a\ndigital ID imposed worldwide are not schemes for the far-distant future.\nThe <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">UN</org> development goals motivating the construction of the ID scheme\ncall for implementation by 2030, just a decade away. But already, much\nof the infrastructure is in place.</p>\n\n<p>From Thales and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Vienna:GTO\">Gemalto</org> already launching digital ID wallets, to\npilot projects in places such as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/bd\">Bangladesh</location> and early digital ID\noperations in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ee\">Estonia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location>, to name just two of many, the\nelectronic control trap is ready to spring.</p>\n\n<p>\"The technology sector is on a mission to equip everyone on\nthe planet with a digital and online presence,\" wrote <org>Gavi Vaccine\nAlliance</org> CEO <person>Seth Berkely</person> in Nature in 2017. \"One of the biggest\nneeds is for affordable, secure digital identification systems that can\nstore a child's medical history, and that can be accessed even in\nplaces without reliable electricity. That might seem a tall order, but\nit is both achievable and necessary,\" he concluded.</p>\n\n<p>Again, Berkely was writing in 2017. The scheme has made great\nstrides since then, and a pandemic is just what is needed to scare a\nfearful populace into submission.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to what the Deep State schemers and planners claim, people\nreceive neither legitimacy nor identity from an NGO- or\ngovernment-administered database or tracking system. Each person's\nnatural rights are inherent in their humanity and cannot be subjected in\nany legitimate way to control, management, and regulation by some\noligarchic international bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>A digital ID scheme is nothing more than a means of tracking\npersonal activity and limiting and regulating access and behavior. It is\nantithetical to a free people. That the plans for this have been and\ncontinue to be made at international conferences and behind the closed\ndoors of international agencies and NGOs, unreported by the media and\nwithout citizen knowledge or assent, tells you much about their\nessential nature.</p>\n\n<p>Technocrat oligarchs and planners are not looking to emancipate the\npeoples of the world, but to enslave and control them.
