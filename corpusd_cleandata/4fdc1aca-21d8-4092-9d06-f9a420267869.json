    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Japan Daily\nReport -- According to news reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by\nNewsRx journalists, a patent application by the inventor Tsutsui, Ryo (Matsudo\nCity, Japan), filed on November 14, 2019, was made available online on May 21,\n2020.\n\nThe assignee for this patent application is STMicroelectronics (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nReporters obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Infinite impulse response filters (IIR) filters\nare widely used for signal processing. Compared with finite impulse response\n(FIR) filters, IIR filters usually provide better frequency response at the\nsame computational cost. However, IIR filters are more precision-sensitive.\nConsequently, IIR filters can suffer from inaccuracy problems or, in some\ncases, divergence if improperly implemented. This risk is particularly true\nfor IIR filter implemented with fixed-point processors and with fixed-point\nhardware IPs.\"\n\nIn addition to obtaining background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx editors also obtained the inventor's summary information for this\npatent application: \"In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a\nmethod of filtering includes generating a random value by a random number\ngenerator circuit, filtering a first signal by a first filter to form a\nfiltered first signal, dithering the filtered first signal using the random\nvalue to form a dithered first signal, filtering a second signal by a second\nfilter to form a filtered second signal, and dithering the filtered second\nsignal using the random value to form a dithered second signal.\n\n\"In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, an IIR filter\nincludes a plurality of lower order filter stages and a random number\ngenerator circuit. The plurality of lower order filter stages includes a first\nfilter stage coupled to a second filter stage. The random number generator\ncircuit includes a first output coupled to the first filter stage and a second\noutput coupled to the second filter stage. The random number generator circuit\nis configured to generate a random value at both the first output and the\nsecond output. The IIR filter is an nth order filter and a respective order of\neach of the lower order filter stages is less than n.\n\n\"In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, a multichannel\nIIR filter includes a plurality of channels and a random number generator\ncircuit. The plurality of channels includes a first channel and a second\nchannel. The random number generator circuit includes a first output coupled\nto a first filter of the first channel and a second output coupled to a second\nfilter of the second channel. The random number generator circuit is\nconfigured to generate a random value at both the first output and the second\noutput.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\. A method of filtering comprising: generating a random value by a random\nnumber generator circuit; filtering a first signal by a first filter to form a\nfiltered first signal; dithering the filtered first signal using the random\nvalue to form a dithered first signal; filtering a second signal by a second\nfilter to form a filtered second signal; and dithering the filtered second\nsignal using the random value to form a dithered second signal.\n\n\"2\\.

Compared with finite impulse response (FIR) filters, IIR filters usually provide better frequency response at the same computational cost. However, IIR filters are more precision-sensitive. Consequently, IIR filters can suffer from inaccuracy problems or, in some cases, divergence if improperly implemented. This risk is particularly true for IIR filter implemented with fixed-point processors and with fixed-point hardware IPs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to obtaining background information on this patent application, NewsRx editors also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent application: &#8220;In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method of filtering includes generating a random value by a random number generator circuit, filtering a first signal by a first filter to form a filtered first signal, dithering the filtered first signal using the random value to form a dithered first signal, filtering a second signal by a second filter to form a filtered second signal, and dithering the filtered second signal using the random value to form a dithered second signal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, an IIR filter includes a plurality of lower order filter stages and a random number generator circuit. The plurality of lower order filter stages includes a first filter stage coupled to a second filter stage. The random number generator circuit includes a first output coupled to the first filter stage and a second output coupled to the second filter stage. The random number generator circuit is configured to generate a random value at both the first output and the second output. The IIR filter is an nth order filter and a respective order of each of the lower order filter stages is less than n.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, a multichannel IIR filter includes a plurality of channels and a random number generator circuit. The plurality of channels includes a first channel and a second channel. The random number generator circuit includes a first output coupled to a first filter of the first channel and a second output coupled to a second filter of the second channel.
