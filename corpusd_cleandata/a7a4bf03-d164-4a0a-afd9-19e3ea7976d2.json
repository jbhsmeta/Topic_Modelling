    "text": "LAKE COUNTY, Calif. \u0096 Two more Lake County residents have been confirmed to\nhave COVID-19, the county's Public Health officer reported on Memorial Day.\n\nThe newest cases bring Lake County's COVID-19 case total to 14.\n\nDr. Gary Pace said the two latest cases were detected through a recent testing\nsite.\n\nPace said given recent increases in community activity and broader\navailability of testing, new infections are probable right now. Just last\nweek, four new cases were reported in Lake County.\n\nHe said an impromptu testing site was created last Friday to follow up on some\ncontacts from a previous case and results began returning over the weekend.\n\nThe two newly confirmed cases were among 40 tests received so far from that\nrecent testing site. Pace said the results from 55 tests are still pending.\n\nThe two individuals newly confirmed to have the virus are stable and isolating\nat home, and further contact tracing has begun, Pace said.\n\n\"I am very pleased to report the previous cases are all doing well, and the\nperson who was recently in the hospital has been released to their home in\ngood condition,\" Pace said in a Monday statement.\n\nPace said the county continues to try to strike a balance between allowing\nmore activity and protecting people from the transmission of the virus.\n\n\"Over the next 10 to 14 days, we will monitor the effects increased social\nmixing and out-of-town visitors have on the infection rate in Lake County,\" he\nsaid.\n\nIf someone believes they may have been exposed, Pace said drive-thru testing\nis available at different locations around the county, open daily during the\nweek.\n\nPeople in need of testing can go to the Verily website and get screened and\nmake an appointment.\n\nFrequently asked questions on drive-thru testing are available here.\n\nEmail Elizabeth Larson at\n[elarson@lakeconews.com](mailto:elarson@lakeconews.com) .

Just last week, four new cases were reported in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.lake\">Lake County</location>.</p>\n\n<p>He said an impromptu testing site was created last Friday to follow up on some contacts from a previous case and results began returning over the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>The two newly confirmed cases were among 40 tests received so far from that recent testing site. Pace said the results from 55 tests are still pending.</p>\n\n<p>The two individuals newly confirmed to have the virus are stable and isolating at home, and further contact tracing has begun, Pace said.</p>\n\n<p>\"I am very pleased to report the previous cases are all doing well, and the person who was recently in the hospital has been released to their home in good condition,\" Pace said in a Monday statement.</p>\n\n<p>Pace said the county continues to try to strike a balance between allowing more activity and protecting people from the transmission of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>\"Over the next 10 to 14 days, we will monitor the effects increased social mixing and out-of-town visitors have on the infection rate in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.lake\">Lake County</location>,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>If someone believes they may have been exposed, Pace said drive-thru testing is available at different locations around the county, open daily during the week.</p>\n\n<p>People in need of testing can go to the Verily website and get screened and make an appointment.</p>\n\n<p>Frequently asked questions on drive-thru testing are available here.</p>\n\n<p>Email <person>Elizabeth Larson</person> at <a href=\"mailto:elarson@lakeconews.com\">elarson@lakeconews.com</a> .
