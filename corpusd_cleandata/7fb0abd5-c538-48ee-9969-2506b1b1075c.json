    "text": "The Chautauqua Center has received $50,000 in emergency grant funding from the\nmedical aid organization Direct Relief, in partnership with the National\nAssociation of Community Health Centers.The Chautauqua Center was among 518\nfederally qualified health centers to receive funding last week through Direct\nRelief's $25 million Covid-19 Fund for Community Health, which recognizes the\nprofound effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the finances, services, staff,\nand patients of community health centers.The Chautauqua Center will use the\nmoney to help expand their screening and telehealth programs. The screening\nprogram demands have increased over the past few weeks as the community moves\nthrough the phased re-opening plan for local businesses. The telehealth\nprogram has permitted the center to offer a safe way to continue providing\nvital healthcare services to residents of Chautauqua County.\"Access to primary\ncare is what keeps people healthy and out of the hospital, and the frontline\nwork of The Chautauqua Center and other nonprofit community health centers\nacross the US is more critical than ever with the onset of Covid-19,\"\"Direct\nRelief is doing everything possible to bolster the work and support the staff\nat the safety-net health facilities on which so many patients and their\nfamilies rely for excellent care and trust for advice in this public health\nemergency.\"Nearly 30 million (one in 12) of the country's most vulnerable\nresidents -- including one in three individuals living in poverty, one in five\nMedicaid beneficiaries and one in nine children -- rely on federally qualified\nhealth centers like The Chautauqua Center for their health care. That number\nis expected to rise as more people lose employer-sponsored insurance.\"We are\ngrateful for this critical and immediate support as Community Health Centers\nwork hard to keep communities safe during an unprecedented pandemic,\"\"We are\nalso deeply appreciative of our longstanding partnership with Direct Relief in\nthese uncertain times and their efforts to ensure that health centers\nconfronting multiple challenges in underserved communities have the resources\nwhen and where they need them. We know that many donors and contributors have\nhelped to make this fund possible, and we further extend our appreciation to\nall of them.\"Since opening in 2013, the Chautauqua Center has created an\naffordable health care option for more than 10,000 patients annually. The\nChautauqua Center has locations in Dunkirk and Jamestown and is open from 8\na.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday.

    "html": "<p>The Chautauqua Center has received <money>$50,000</money> in emergency grant funding from the medical aid organization Direct Relief, in partnership with the <org>National Association of Community Health Centers</org>.The Chautauqua Center was among 518 federally qualified health centers to receive funding last week through Direct Relief&#8217;s <money>$25 million</money> <org>Covid-19 Fund for Community Health</org>, which recognizes the profound effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the finances, services, staff, and patients of community health centers.The Chautauqua Center will use the money to help expand their screening and telehealth programs. The screening program demands have increased over the past few weeks as the community moves through the phased re-opening plan for local businesses. The telehealth program has permitted the center to offer a safe way to continue providing vital healthcare services to residents of Chautauqua County.&#8220;Access to primary care is what keeps people healthy and out of the hospital, and the frontline work of The Chautauqua Center and other nonprofit community health centers across the US is more critical than ever with the onset of Covid-19,&#8221;&#8220;Direct Relief is doing everything possible to bolster the work and support the staff at the safety-net health facilities on which so many patients and their families rely for excellent care and trust for advice in this public health emergency.&#8221;Nearly 30 million (one in 12) of the country&#8217;s most vulnerable residents &#8212; including one in three individuals living in poverty, one in five Medicaid beneficiaries and one in nine children &#8212; rely on federally qualified health centers like <org>The Chautauqua Center</org> for their health care. That number is expected to rise as more people lose employer-sponsored insurance.&#8220;We are grateful for this critical and immediate support as <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1134063634\">Community Health Centers</org> work hard to keep communities safe during an unprecedented pandemic,&#8221;&#8220;We are also deeply appreciative of our longstanding partnership with Direct Relief in these uncertain times and their efforts to ensure that health centers confronting multiple challenges in underserved communities have the resources when and where they need them. We know that many donors and contributors have helped to make this fund possible, and we further extend our appreciation to all of them.&#8221;Since opening in 2013, the Chautauqua Center has created an affordable health care option for more than 10,000 patients annually. The Chautauqua Center has locations in Dunkirk and Jamestown and is open from <chron>8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday</chron> and <chron>8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday</chron>.
