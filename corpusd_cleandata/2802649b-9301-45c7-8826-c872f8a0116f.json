There are many\nmethods to treat the dislocation of patella, among which the reconstruction of\nmedial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the main one. In this paper, the\nbiomechanics and graft selection of medial patellofemoral ligament\nreconstruction were discussed in detail by reviewing the relevant literature\nat home and abroad. The femoral insertion, patellofemoral fixation and\npostoperative complications were also discussed, in order to provide reference\nfor clinical workers.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"In view of different\npostoperative complications, there are many kinds of optimization schemes, and\nreasonable choice of operation scheme is the premise of good operation\nsatisfaction rate.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Research progress of medial\npatellofemoral ligament reconstruction. _Journal of Hainan Medical University_\n, 2020,26(5):56-59.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Health &amp; Medicine Daily</org> -- Researchers detail new data in health and medicine. According to news originating from <org>Second Hospital</org> of <org>Shanxi Medical University</org> by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;Patellar dislocation is a common disease in orthopaedics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news editors obtained a quote from the research from <org>Second Hospital</org> of <org>Shanxi Medical University</org>: &#8220;The incidence of patellar dislocation is the highest in adolescents with an average age of 21.4 years. There are many methods to treat the dislocation of patella, among which the reconstruction of medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the main one. In this paper, the biomechanics and graft selection of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction were discussed in detail by reviewing the relevant literature at home and abroad. The femoral insertion, patellofemoral fixation and postoperative complications were also discussed, in order to provide reference for clinical workers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;In view of different postoperative complications, there are many kinds of optimization schemes, and reasonable choice of operation scheme is the premise of good operation satisfaction rate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Research progress of medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. <em><org>Journal of Hainan Medical University</org></em>, 2020,26(5):56-59.
