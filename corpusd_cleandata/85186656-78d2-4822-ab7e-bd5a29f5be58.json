    "text": "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Monday extended his safer-at-home coronavirus\ndirective until July 1 with some modifications giving more leeway for the\nstate's older residents.\n\n\"It may feel like we are getting back to normal, but the virus is still here,\nand it could surge back the moment we let our guard down,\" Polis said in a\nwritten statement. \"We are still far from normal. Coloradans have to remain\ndiligent, and must continue staying home or in the great outdoors away from\nothers as much as possible, wearing masks when we leave the house, and washing\nour hands.\"\n\nThe safer-at-home period, during which restaurants and shops have been allowed\nto reopen, was set to expire Monday night.\n\n\"Over these next few weeks, each and every one of us has a responsibility to\nprotect ourselves and others, especially as we begin venturing out onto our\ntrails and open space,\" the governor said.\n\nThe changes to the safer-at-home order come even as health care experts warn\nthat data point toward a possible coronavirus resurgence in Colorado. Health\nexperts are worried that crowds gathering to protest the death of George\nFloyd, the man who died last week at the hands of police officers in\nMinneapolis, could lead to an increase in infections.\n\nThrough Monday, 26,577 people have either tested positive for the disease or\nare considered to have infections because of their proximity to someone who\ntested positive. Nearly 1,500 who have contracted the virus have died,\nincluding 1,185 whose deaths have been directly linked to coronavirus.\n\nPolis changed the safer-at-home directive to allow people age 65 or older or\nwith pre-existing conditions that make them vulnerable to coronavirus to visit\nparks and recreate outdoors as long as they wear a mask and stay at least 6\nfeet from others.\n\nPeople considered vulnerable to the disease cannot be compelled to perform in-\nperson jobs under Polis' directive.\n\nBefore the modifications, high-risk Coloradans, those age 65 or older or who\nhave underlying health conditions, were required to stay home unless\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nThe safer-at-home order also advises Coloradans to get tested for COVID-19,\nthe disease caused by the coronavirus, if they have symptoms and continue\npracticing social distancing and limiting their social interactions \"to the\ngreatest extent possible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, gatherings of more than 10 people are still prohibited and\nbusinesses and governments are strongly encouraged to allow workers to\ntelecommute as much as possible.\n\nShort-term rentals can resumePolis and his Colorado Department of Public\nHealth and Environment are allowing short-term rentals \u0096 such as Airbnbs \u0096 to\nresume operating as of Monday.\n\nThey must, however, follow state guidelines, including:\n\nProvide guests with soap and water and/or hand sanitizer.Provide guests with\ncleaning and/or disinfectant products.Avoid scheduling guests on back to back\ndays to ensure proper cleaning can occur.Routinely check infection data in the\ncity or county of the rental.Routinely check and implement local coronavirus\nguidelines.Clearly communicate with guests regarding cleaning and disinfecting\nsteps.Collect all guests' contact information and be prepared to support local\npublic health contact tracing efforts if exposures occur.\n\nGov. Polis extends safer-at-home coronavirus directive until July 1\n\nPlaces of worship, outdoor recreation and sports guidance comingThe state is\nfinalizing guidance this week that will allow places of worship, outdoor\nrecreation businesses and team sports to reopen or resume on Thursday.\n\nThey will be required to follow social distancing guidelines and frequently\nclean surfaces.\n\nFor places of worship, draft guidance says they can operate only at 50% of\ntheir capacity or with up to 50 people in their primary worship place.\n\nOutdoor recreation businesses must perform daily exposure and symptom checks\nof their employees and limit the number of people in their facilities to 50%\nof capacity or up to 10 people at any time.\n\nTeam sports will be able to resume on a limited basis. Organized youth or\nadult recreational sports leagues can gather in groups of 25 if they are\noutdoors or groups of 10 if they are indoors.\n\nGov. Polis extends safer-at-home coronavirus directive until July 1\n\nPlaygrounds will be able to reopen, but only with up to 10 people at a time\nand proper signs about social distancing. Outdoor sports facilities, such as\ntennis courts, basketball courts and fields, must follow the same rules.\"Do\nnot share snacks or water, except in emergency situations,\" the guidance says.\n\nOutdoor swimming pools will be allowed to reopen at 50% of their capacity or\nup to 50 people, whichever is fewer.\n\nThe Colorado Sun is a reader-supported, journalist-owned news outlet exploring\nissues of statewide interest.

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location> Gov. <person>Jared Polis</person> on Monday extended his safer-at-home coronavirus directive until <chron>July 1</chron> with some modifications giving more leeway for the state's older residents.</p>\n<p>\"It may feel like we are getting back to normal, but the virus is still here, and it could surge back the moment we let our guard down,\" Polis said in a written statement. \"We are still far from normal. Coloradans have to remain diligent, and must continue staying home or in the great outdoors away from others as much as possible, wearing masks when we leave the house, and washing our hands.\"</p>\n\n<p>The safer-at-home period, during which restaurants and shops have been allowed to reopen, was set to expire Monday night.</p>\n\n<p>\"Over these next few weeks, each and every one of us has a responsibility to protect ourselves and others, especially as we begin venturing out onto our trails and open space,\" the governor said.</p>\n\n<p>The changes to the safer-at-home order come even as health care experts warn that data point toward a possible coronavirus resurgence in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location>. Health experts are worried that crowds gathering to protest the death of <person>George Floyd</person>, the man who died last week at the hands of police officers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location>, could lead to an increase in infections.</p>\n\n<p>Through Monday, 26,577 people have either tested positive for the disease or are considered to have infections because of their proximity to someone who tested positive. Nearly 1,500 who have contracted the virus have died, including 1,185 whose deaths have been directly linked to coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p>Polis changed the safer-at-home directive to allow people age 65 or older or with pre-existing conditions that make them vulnerable to coronavirus to visit parks and recreate outdoors as long as they wear a mask and stay at least 6 feet from others.</p>\n\n<p>People considered vulnerable to the disease cannot be compelled to perform in-person jobs under Polis' directive.</p>\n\n<p>Before the modifications, high-risk Coloradans, those age 65 or older or who have underlying health conditions, were required to stay home unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The safer-at-home order also advises Coloradans to get tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, if they have symptoms and continue practicing social distancing and limiting their social interactions \"to the greatest extent possible.\"</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, gatherings of more than 10 people are still prohibited and businesses and governments are strongly encouraged to allow workers to telecommute as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Short-term rentals can resumePolis and his <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0247934432\">Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment</org> are allowing short-term rentals &#150; such as Airbnbs &#150; to resume operating as of Monday.</p>\n\n<p>They must, however, follow state guidelines, including:</p>\n\n<p>Provide guests with soap and water and/or hand sanitizer.Provide guests with cleaning and/or disinfectant products.Avoid scheduling guests on back to back days to ensure proper cleaning can occur.Routinely check infection data in the city or county of the rental.Routinely check and implement local coronavirus guidelines.Clearly communicate with guests regarding cleaning and disinfecting steps.Collect all guests' contact information and be prepared to support local public health contact tracing efforts if exposures occur.</p>\n\n<p><person>Gov. Polis</person> extends safer-at-home coronavirus directive until <chron>July 1</chron></p>\n\n<p>Places of worship, outdoor recreation and sports guidance comingThe state is finalizing guidance this week that will allow places of worship, outdoor recreation businesses and team sports to reopen or resume on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>They will be required to follow social distancing guidelines and frequently clean surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>For places of worship, draft guidance says they can operate only at 50% of their capacity or with up to 50 people in their primary worship place.</p>\n\n<p>Outdoor recreation businesses must perform daily exposure and symptom checks of their employees and limit the number of people in their facilities to 50% of capacity or up to 10 people at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Team sports will be able to resume on a limited basis. Organized youth or adult recreational sports leagues can gather in groups of 25 if they are outdoors or groups of 10 if they are indoors.</p>\n\n<p><person>Gov. Polis</person> extends safer-at-home coronavirus directive until <chron>July 1</chron></p>\n\n<p>Playgrounds will be able to reopen, but only with up to 10 people at a time and proper signs about social distancing. Outdoor sports facilities, such as tennis courts, basketball courts and fields, must follow the same rules.\"Do not share snacks or water, except in emergency situations,\" the guidance says.</p>\n\n<p>Outdoor swimming pools will be allowed to reopen at 50% of their capacity or up to 50 people, whichever is fewer.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Colorado Sun</org> is a reader-supported, journalist-owned news outlet exploring issues of statewide interest.
