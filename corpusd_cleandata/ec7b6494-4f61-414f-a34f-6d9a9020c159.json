    "text": "JONESBORO \\- The federal government approved Craighead County residents and\nbusinesses to use a program to receive low-interest loans for disaster relief.\n\nCounty Judge Marvin Day said Friday that he received word from the Small\nBusiness Administration that it had approved businesses and residents to apply\nfor the loans.\n\n\"So that is really big news so people who have uninsured losses \u0096 things like\ninventory \u0096 they're able to get their business back going, and it'll be\naffordable for them because, generally speaking, the interest rates are about\nhalf of what the market rate is,\" Day said.\n\nPreviously, the Small Business Administration approved non-profits that were\ninvolved with efforts to help people after the tornado for the same types of\nloans.\n\nDay said the Jonesboro Regional Chamber of Commerce was instrumental in\npushing for county businesses to get the loans.\n\n\"We're all real excited that that happened today,\" Day said on Friday.\n\nAccording to a press release, the Small Business Administration approves\n\"long-term disaster loans to businesses of all sizes, private, non-profit\norganizations, homeowners and renters to repair or replace\nuninsured/underinsured disaster damaged property.\"\n\nThe loans are primarily for people who had their business, non-profit or home\ndamaged by the March tornado in Jonesboro.\n\nBut according to the release, the administration also offers Economic Injury\nDisaster loans for businesses that didn't sustain physical damage but have\ndifficulty conducting business because of the twister.\n\nNortheast Arkansas residents in Craighead, Greene, Jackson, Lawrence,\nMississippi and Poinsett and the Missouri county of Dunklin can apply.\n\nThe deadline to turn in applications for the loans is July 20 to receive loans\nfor physical damage to properties. The deadline for businesses that have faced\neconomic difficulties because of the tornado is Feb. 22, 2021.\n\nAdministration officials recommend that people first file to receive their\ninsurance money to help with damages that occurred during the tornado.\n\nAdministrators have also set up a Virtual Disaster Loan Outreach Center.\nRepresentatives are available by phone at 916-735-1500 or by email at\n[FOCWAssistance@sba.gov](mailto:FOCWAssistance@sba.gov) from 6 a.m. to 2:30\np.m. Monday through Friday, according to the release.\n\nPeople can apply for the loans online at\n<https://disasterloanassistance.sba.gov>.\n\nDay made the announcement at the Craighead County Quorum Court on Monday. The\ncourt met, with some justices of the peace continuing to utilize the\nopportunity to attend virtually, at 5:30 p.m. in the basement of the\nCourthouse Annex, as it has done since Gov. Asa Hutchinson approved for\njustices to begin meeting via Zoom. While most justices met in person, a few\ncontinue to meet online to protect themselves from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
