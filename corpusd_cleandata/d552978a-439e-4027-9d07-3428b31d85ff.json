    "text": "The MRC was proposing to move its Caulfield Cup and Guineas features to the\nback end of November to avoid a clash with finals and to give its members a\ngreater chance of attending the races.\"Another weak decision, totally\npredictable, gutless position as far as I'm concerned,\" Le Grand said on\nSEN.\"Here was an opportunity to be different in racing, to be innovative and\ntry something different. There's absolutely no innovation coming out of\nRVL.\"Fair dinkum, I'm nearly speechless. I can't believe it. Here was an\nopportunity in COVID-19 times to put it back a month, give people and members\na chance to get the races in better weather, and what do we do? Just keep on\ngoing the way you're going, don't change anything, just go along with what\nwe've been doing the last hundred years.\"Kruger said RV had undergone a six-\nweek process \"at least\" to explore how a revamped program might have looked,\nin order to avoid a clash with finals and give the sport a better chance at\nhosting crowds.LoadingHowever, he said potential upside to overhauling its\ntime-honoured carnival were uncertain enough \"to warrant making such a\nsignificant change\".\"The spring racing carnival has been so successful, it\nreally is a global icon and we felt in order to consider making changes, even\nin this COVID-effected world, there really needed to be some compelling\nreasons for us to do that,\" Kruger said.Blanksby said the MRC would\n\"absolutely\" look at the proposal for next year's spring.\"We put this up\nbecause we feel that's a period of the sporting calendar that's vacant,\" he\nsaid.\"There's better weather and racing can have that chance to absolutely own\nthat space. It's been a really positive debate, the pros and cons, so we'll\nmonitor how [wagering] results go this spring \u2026 and then see how it\ngoes.\"Blanksby added he would be ask RV for its wagering analysis after Kruger\nsaid bookmakers were split on whether a November spring carnival would\nmaterially improve the sport's wagering income.The Club has been adamant the\nCup carnival and its traditional first Tuesday in November date is sacrosanct\nand would not be moving. Moonee Valley Club had opted to stay in its\ntraditional late October space too, with every likelihood that the Cox Plate\nwill now be an afternoon hors d'oeuvres for a night grand final on October\n24.VRC chief executive Neil Wilson said it was \"good to have clarity\".\"We were\nnot opposed to it [running the Caulfield Cup later in the year] but we know\nthe programme as is, is a model that works,\" he said.Moonee Valley boss\nMichael Browell said: \" the club was willing to consider both options. We now\nretain the two-day carnival, Friday night with the Manikato as the headline\nand the 100th running of the Cox Plate on the Saturday.\"We are happy to retain\nthe traditional carnival format but were equally as happy to consider the one-\noff change this year, to accommodate the MRC's request in light of the impact\nof COVID.\"RV has, however, decided to move the Underwood Stakes - which is\ntraditionally held on the Sunday after the grand final - back to a Saturday\nmeeting, while confirming the preferred race time for the October 24 Cox Plate\nwas during the day.License this articleSpring CarnivalDamien RactliffeDamien\nRactliffe is the Chief Reporter for .Michael LynchMichael Lynch is 's chief\nsoccer reporter and also reports on motor sport and horseracingMost Viewed in",

    "html": "<p>The MRC was proposing to move its Caulfield Cup and Guineas features to the back end of November to avoid a clash with  finals and to give its members a greater chance of attending the races.\"Another weak decision, totally predictable, gutless position as far as I'm concerned,\" Le Grand said on SEN.\"Here was an opportunity to be different in racing, to be innovative and try something different. There's absolutely no innovation coming out of RVL.\"Fair dinkum, I'm nearly speechless. I can't believe it. Here was an opportunity in COVID-19 times to put it back a month, give people and members a chance to get the races in better weather, and what do we do? Just keep on going the way you're going, don't change anything, just go along with what we've been doing the last hundred years.\"Kruger said RV had undergone a six-week process \"at least\" to explore how a revamped program might have looked, in order to avoid a clash with  finals and give the sport a better chance at hosting crowds.LoadingHowever, he said potential upside to overhauling its time-honoured carnival were uncertain enough \"to warrant making such a significant change\".\"The spring racing carnival has been so successful, it really is a global icon and we felt in order to consider making changes, even in this COVID-effected world, there really needed to be some compelling reasons for us to do that,\" Kruger said.Blanksby said the MRC would \"absolutely\" look at the proposal for next year's spring.\"We put this up because we feel that's a period of the sporting calendar that's vacant,\" he said.\"There's better weather and racing can have that chance to absolutely own that space. It's been a really positive debate, the pros and cons, so we'll monitor how [wagering] results go this spring &#8230; and then see how it goes.\"Blanksby added he would be ask RV for its wagering analysis after Kruger said bookmakers were split on whether a November spring carnival would materially improve the sport's wagering income.The   Club has been adamant the  Cup carnival and its traditional first Tuesday in November date is sacrosanct and would not be moving. Moonee Valley  Club had opted to stay in its traditional late October space too, with every likelihood that the Cox Plate will now be an afternoon hors d'oeuvres for a night  grand final on October 24.VRC chief executive <person>Neil Wilson</person> said it was \"good to have clarity\".\"We were not opposed to it [running the Caulfield Cup later in the year] but we know the programme as is, is a model that works,\" he said.<location>Moonee Valley</location> boss <person>Michael Browell</person> said: \" the club was willing to consider both options. We now retain the two-day carnival, Friday night with the Manikato as the headline and the 100th running of the Cox Plate on the Saturday.\"We are happy to retain the traditional carnival format but were equally as happy to consider the one-off change this year, to accommodate the MRC's request in light of the impact of COVID.\"RV has, however, decided to move the Underwood Stakes - which is traditionally held on the Sunday after the  grand final - back to a Saturday meeting, while confirming the preferred race time for the <chron>October 24</chron> Cox Plate was during the day.License this articleSpring  CarnivalDamien RactliffeDamien Ractliffe is the Chief  Reporter for .Michael LynchMichael Lynch is 's chief soccer reporter and also reports on motor sport and horseracingMost Viewed in</p>",
