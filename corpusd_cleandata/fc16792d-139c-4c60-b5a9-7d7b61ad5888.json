With the pandemic, this season's schedule has been\nimpacted and will be presented live through Facebook live streaming.\n\nSummer recreation program canceled\n\nThe town's 2020 Summer Recreation Program, also referred to as the Summer\nPlayground Program, is canceled for this season. The Recreation Department has\ndetermined it is not feasible to hold the program in light of the school\nbuilding closures as well as the draft guidelines for summer day camps put out\nthrough the state.\n\nFood support available\n\nFor those in need of food during the pandemic, St. Jude's Parish offers help\nfrom its longstanding food pantry. The food pantry is a volunteer-run mission\nat the church, started as a small holiday basket effort and growing through\nthe decades into an organization that supports individuals and families in\nneed with food not only donated by the parish congregation but also through\nconnections with local businesses, organizations and the New Hampshire Food\nBank.\n\nAnyone needing help can call the food pantry at 603-434-1827 and give\ninformation on the number of people in a family, and then get directions on\nhow to go to the church at 435 Mammoth Road and pick up food safely and with\nno contact.\n\nIn addition, the Londonderry Senior Center offers pickup of Meals on Wheels\nfood on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. To register for this service, call the\nsenior center and leave a message at 603-432-8554 and the senior director will\nreturn calls.\n\nLibrary offers pickup service\n\nLeach Library begins a drive-through service beginning June 1, and continuing\nMonday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nPatrons can call the library with lists of what materials they would like and\narrange a time for the pickup. Patrons coming to the library will remain in\ntheir car and library staff will safely come out wearing protective gear and\nwill check identification and library card at that time. Staff will then place\nmaterials in the vehicle. Call the library for information or to schedule a\npickup at 603-432-1132.",

The food pantry is a volunteer-run mission at the church, started as a small holiday basket effort and growing through the decades into an organization that supports individuals and families in need with food not only donated by the parish congregation but also through connections with local businesses, organizations and the <org>New Hampshire Food Bank</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone needing help can call the food pantry at 603-434-1827 and give information on the number of people in a family, and then get directions on how to go to the church at <location>435 Mammoth Road</location> and pick up food safely and with no contact.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the <org>Londonderry Senior Center</org> offers pickup of <org>Meals on Wheels</org> food on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. To register for this service, call the senior center and leave a message at 603-432-8554 and the senior director will return calls.</p>\n\n<p>Library offers pickup service</p>\n\n<p><org>Leach Library</org> begins a drive-through service beginning <chron>June 1</chron>, and continuing Monday through Friday, <chron>10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</chron>, and Saturday, <chron>10 a.m. to 2 p.m.</chron> Patrons can call the library with lists of what materials they would like and arrange a time for the pickup. Patrons coming to the library will remain in their car and library staff will safely come out wearing protective gear and will check identification and library card at that time. Staff will then place materials in the vehicle. Call the library for information or to schedule a pickup at 603-432-1132.</p>",
