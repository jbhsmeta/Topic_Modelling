    "text": "Albany, June 4 \\-- Outdoor dining will be permitted in Phase 2 of New York's\nreopening plan for exiting the coronavirus crisis, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\nannounced Wednesday, giving a boost to restaurant owners desperate to restart\nafter months of a crippling shutdown.\n\nThe move means restaurants on Long Island may be able to start offering\noutdoor dining as soon as next week, when Nassau and Suffolk hope they will\nqualify to enter the next phase.\n\nThe prospect of returning chefs to kitchens, bringing back waitstaff and\nserving customers was a ray of hope for many business owners struggling to\nhold on through much uncertainty.\n\n\"We're feeling a combination of first-day-of-school jitters and just a huge\namount of relief,\" said Frank Antonetti, co-owner of The Rust & Gold in\nHuntington. \"The hope of this day is what kept us going during the toughest\ndays of quarantine.\"\n\nHe managed to keep 60% of his small staff with curbside pickup, takeout and\ndelivery, but said it hasn't been easy. There will be much to work out in the\ndays ahead, Antonetti said, \"But now that this day is here, any problem that\ncomes along with it in my book is an easy one.\"\n\nOfficials throughout Long Island welcomed the decision, reported Newsday.\n\n\"This will help boost the recovery of our restaurants and Main Street\ncommunities we cherish,\" said Nassau Executive Laura Curran. \"And in Nassau\nCounty, we are prepared to maximize this opportunity with a program to fast-\ntrack road closures in our downtowns, encouraging creative ways for shops and\nrestaurants to safely expand.\"\n\nSuffolk County Executive Steve Bellone called the action \"very good news.\"\n\nFarmingdale Mayor Ralph Ekstrand, who was among Long Island officials lobbying\nCuomo to fast-track outdoor dining, said the governor's action \"will greatly\nhelp the restaurants,\" though he wants more details about requirements for\nmasks and social distancing.
