    "text": "JONESBORO - A Lake City man was being held in jail Wednesday after police say\nhe injured an officer during an arrest.\n\nRobert Carter, 52, fled from a vehicle Monday that Jonesboro Police Officer\nAasin Lester was going to pull over for a defective license plate light,\naccording to the probable cause affidavit.\n\nA foot chase ensued in the area of North Church Street and East Gordon Street.\nIn a church parking lot, Lester used his Taser twice on Carter.\n\nCarter \"wouldn't comply\" to Lester's orders to place his hands behind his\nback, the affidavit read. When the officer attempted to arrest the suspect, he\n\"was reaching for a knife that was on his waist.\"\n\nAfter a scuffle with Lester, Carter threw a pill bottle containing an\nassortment of pills and 2.4 grams of marijuana in a neighboring yard, reports\nstate.\n\nThe officer pointed his gun at him and attempted to pepper spray him, but the\nsuspect still didn't comply with the officer's order to place his hands behind\nhis back.\n\nCarter reached into his right pants pocket, the affidavit states. Because\nOfficer Tanner Huff \"was worried that Carter may have a weapon in his pocket,\"\nthe officer hit the suspect in the torso twice with his knee.\n\nHe then complied with officers and was handcuffed, but it didn't stop him from\nreaching for the knife clipped to his pocket, according to the affidavit.\n\nOther items seized from Carter include two glass meth pipes and 1.5 grams of\nmeth, the incident read.\n\nHuff wasn't injured but Lester \"sustained minor injuries during a short\nscuffle with Mr. Carter,\" said Sally Smith, JPD public information specialist.\n\n\"He was transported to St. Bernards where he was treated and released,\" she\nsaid.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Tommy Fowler found probable cause Wednesday to charge\nCarter with possession of meth less than 2 grams, possession of drug\nparaphernalia, second-degree battery injuring an officer, aggravated assault\non a certified law enforcement officer, possession of marijuana less than 4\nounces, fleeing and parole violation.\n\nHis bond was set at $100,000, cash or surety. The suspect's next court\nappearance is scheduled for 8 a.m. July 27 at the Craighead County Courthouse,\n511 S. Main St., Jonesboro.",

In a church parking lot, Lester used his Taser twice on Carter.</p>\n\n<p>Carter \"wouldn't comply\" to Lester's orders to place his hands behind his back, the affidavit read.

Because Officer <person>Tanner Huff</person> \"was worried that Carter may have a weapon in his pocket,\" the officer hit the suspect in the torso twice with his knee.</p>\n\n<p>He then complied with officers and was handcuffed, but it didn't stop him from reaching for the knife clipped to his pocket, according to the affidavit.</p>\n\n<p>Other items seized from Carter include two glass meth pipes and 1.5 grams of meth, the incident read.</p>\n\n<p>Huff wasn't injured but Lester \"sustained minor injuries during a short scuffle with <person>Mr. Carter</person>,\" said <person>Sally Smith</person>, JPD public information specialist.</p>\n\n<p>\"He was transported to <person>St. Bernards</person> where he was treated and released,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>District Court Judge <person>Tommy Fowler</person> found probable cause Wednesday to charge Carter with possession of meth less than 2 grams, possession of drug paraphernalia, second-degree battery injuring an officer, aggravated assault on a certified law enforcement officer, possession of marijuana less than 4 ounces, fleeing and parole violation.</p>\n\n<p>His bond was set at <money>$100,000</money>, cash or surety. The suspect's next court appearance is scheduled for <chron>8 a.m.</chron> <chron>July 27</chron> at the <location>Craighead County Courthouse</location>, <location>511 S.
