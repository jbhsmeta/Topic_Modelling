    "text": "NO hearty handshake from a salesperson and no fancy coffee as you listen to\ntheir pitch -- buying a new car is going to be very different.\n\nSigns at Isaac Agnew showrooms around Belfast, Newtownabbey and Portadown will\nremind customers of the no-handshake rule and the need for social distancing.\n\nCar showrooms are permitted to open from Monday and Isaac Agnew managing\ndirector Yuile Magee has said the new era is the biggest change in how cars\nhave been sold in his 40 years in the industry.\n\nWhile the company's showrooms have been closed in lockdown, it has continued\nto sell online, including six Porsches, with two of these new models retailing\nat \u00a3124,000. But the company has also fielded many queries from customers who\nhave fallen on hard times during lockdown and want to take payment holidays\nfrom their personal contract plans.\n\nOutlining the changes, Mr Magee (above) said that from Monday customers will\nbe expected to keep their distance from salespeople, and test drive cars by\nthemselves.\n\nVehicles will be cleaned between drives and a plastic seal applied to doors\nafter cleaning to make it clear they are safe.\n\nMr Magee said the company's insurance policy permitted lone test drives,\nalthough they had be along designated routes.\n\nHe added: \"We'll also have customers' driving licence details, and we already\nknow a lot of our customers already.\"\n\nThey will exercise discretion and will not allow a teenager to test drive a\nPorsche, however.\n\nTouch-points of the cars will also be sanitised between drives and customers\nwill be offered personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nEamon Bell of dealership Bell's in Crossgar said customers will no longer have\nthe freedom to wander in and out of the showroom.\n\n\"Everything will be cleaned and disinfected and we are planning to implement\nan appointment-only system to begin with to give us time to disinfect desks,\ntables and cars afterwards before the next customer,\" he said. Confident of a\ngood start, he added: \"All the signs have been positive and at the minute I'm\nseeing plenty of demand. Used car sales will be okay but new car sales might\ntake a wee bit longer to come back.\"\n\nMr Magee, meanwhile, said car sales had accelerated after lockdown in some\nterritories.\n\n\"We'd be hopeful that would be the case here, but if there's a really bad\nrecession that might reverse it in the UK,\" he said.\n\n\"Initially there will be pent-up demand, which we will meet, but by August,\nSeptember or October things will be more clear for the long-term picture.\"\n\nThe MD at Isaac Agnew believes manufacturers will offer generous finance plans\nto shift cars. He added: \"They will need to find market share and homes for\nthe cars they are producing.\n\n\"In 2009 after the crash we had a really good year because of the offers\nmanufacturers came up with, so who knows.\"\n\nHowever, he said the factory shutdown across Europe meant many deliveries were\nnow delayed. He is sorry the company has had to shelve some of its customer\nservice features.\n\n\"We've always worked hard on having good coffee, newspapers, magazines,\nfriendly staff and flowers. But now we have to reduce that,\" he explained.\n\"Our staff will be happy to be back in work and will make customers welcome.\nIt may not be just the same as before, but we will have nice hosts and\nhostesses to receive people and take them through the process.\"\n\nDuring the day the company's 'cleaning champions' will check that procedures\nare being carried out properly.\n\n\"I've spent more time on this than anything else in a long time to make sure\nwe've done it right,\" Mr Magee added.",

    "html": "<p>NO hearty handshake from a salesperson and no fancy coffee as you listen to their pitch &#8212; buying a new car is going to be very different.</p>\n<p>Signs at Isaac Agnew showrooms around Belfast, Newtownabbey and Portadown will remind customers of the no-handshake rule and the need for social distancing.</p>\n<p>Car showrooms are permitted to open from Monday and <person>Isaac Agnew</person> managing director Yuile Magee has said the new era is the biggest change in how cars have been sold in his 40 years in the industry.</p>\n<p>While the company's showrooms have been closed in lockdown, it has continued to sell online, including six Porsches, with two of these new models retailing at &#163;124,000. But the company has also fielded many queries from customers who have fallen on hard times during lockdown and want to take payment holidays from their personal contract plans.</p>\n<p>Outlining the changes, <person>Mr Magee</person> (above) said that from Monday customers will be expected to keep their distance from salespeople, and test drive cars by themselves.</p>\n<p>Vehicles will be cleaned between drives and a plastic seal applied to doors after cleaning to make it clear they are safe.</p>\n<p><person>Mr Magee</person> said the company's insurance policy permitted lone test drives, although they had be along designated routes.</p>\n<p>He added: \"We'll also have customers' driving licence details, and we already know a lot of our customers already.\"</p>\n<p>They will exercise discretion and will not allow a teenager to test drive a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Frankfurt:PAH3\">Porsche</org>, however.</p>\n<p>Touch-points of the cars will also be sanitised between drives and customers will be offered personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>\n<p><person>Eamon Bell</person> of dealership Bell's in Crossgar said customers will no longer have the freedom to wander in and out of the showroom.</p>\n<p>\"Everything will be cleaned and disinfected and we are planning to implement an appointment-only system to begin with to give us time to disinfect desks, tables and cars afterwards before the next customer,\" he said. Confident of a good start, he added: \"All the signs have been positive and at the minute I'm seeing plenty of demand. Used car sales will be okay but new car sales might take a wee bit longer to come back.\"</p>\n<p><person>Mr Magee</person>, meanwhile, said car sales had accelerated after lockdown in some territories.</p>\n<p>\"We'd be hopeful that would be the case here, but if there's a really bad recession that might reverse it in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location>,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"Initially there will be pent-up demand, which we will meet, but by August, September or October things will be more clear for the long-term picture.\"</p>\n<p>The MD at Isaac Agnew believes manufacturers will offer generous finance plans to shift cars. He added: \"They will need to find market share and homes for the cars they are producing.</p>\n<p>\"In 2009 after the crash we had a really good year because of the offers manufacturers came up with, so who knows.\"</p>\n<p>However, he said the factory shutdown across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location> meant many deliveries were now delayed. He is sorry the company has had to shelve some of its customer service features.</p>\n<p>\"We've always worked hard on having good coffee, newspapers, magazines, friendly staff and flowers. But now we have to reduce that,\" he explained. \"Our staff will be happy to be back in work and will make customers welcome. It may not be just the same as before, but we will have nice hosts and hostesses to receive people and take them through the process.\"</p>\n<p>During the day the company's 'cleaning champions' will check that procedures are being carried out properly.</p>\n<p>\"I've spent more time on this than anything else in a long time to make sure we've done it right,\" <person>Mr Magee</person> added.</p>",
