    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at CDC & FDA\nDaily \\-- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our\njournalists obtained the following quote sourced from\n[medrxiv.org](http://medrxiv.org):\n\n\"Background: Risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19 are emerging among\nUS cohorts, but patient trajectories during hospitalization ranging from mild-\nmoderate, severe, and death and the factors associated with these outcomes\nhave been underexplored. Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of\nconsecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 Johns Hopkins hospitals in the\nBaltimore/DC area between March 4 and April 24, 2020. Disease severity and\noutcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal\nscale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess\nrelationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to\nsevere disease or death.\n\n\"Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1%) were\ndischarged, 113 (13.6%) died, and 85 (10.2%) remained hospitalized. Among\nthose discharged, 518 (82%) had mild/moderate and 116 (18%) had severe\nillness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing\nage per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing\nhome residence (aHR 2.13, 95%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13;\n95% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer\ngreater than 1mg/dL (aHR 2.79; 95% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR\n2.79; 95%CI 1.53-5.09).\n\n\"In patients under 60, only male sex (aHR 1.7;95%CI 1.11-2.58), increasing\nbody mass index (BMI) (aHR1.25 1.14-1.37), Charlson score (aHR 1.27; 1.1-1.46)\nand respiratory rate (aHR 1.16; 95%CI 1.13-1.2) were associated with severe\nillness or death.\n\n\"Conclusions: A combination of demographic and clinical features on admission\nis strongly associated with progression to severe disease or death in a US\ncohort of COVID-19 patients. Younger patients have distinct risk factors for\npoor outcomes.\"\n\nThis preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>CDC &amp; FDA Daily</org> -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from <a href=\"http://medrxiv.org\">medrxiv.org</a>:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Background: Risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19 are emerging among US cohorts, but patient trajectories during hospitalization ranging from mild-moderate, severe, and death and the factors associated with these outcomes have been underexplored. Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of consecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 <org>Johns Hopkins</org> hospitals in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.bltmre\">Baltimore</location>/DC area <chron>between March 4 and April 24, 2020</chron>. Disease severity and outcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal scale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess relationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to severe disease or death.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1%) were discharged, 113 (13.6%) died, and 85 (10.2%) remained hospitalized. Among those discharged, 518 (82%) had mild/moderate and 116 (18%) had severe illness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing age per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing home residence (aHR 2.13, 95%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer greater than 1mg/dL (aHR 2.79; 95% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR 2.79; 95%CI 1.53-5.09).</p>\n<p>&#8220;In patients under 60, only male sex (aHR 1.7;95%CI 1.11-2.58), increasing body mass index (BMI) (aHR1.25 1.14-1.37), Charlson score (aHR 1.27; 1.1-1.46) and respiratory rate (aHR 1.16; 95%CI 1.13-1.2) were associated with severe illness or death.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Conclusions: A combination of demographic and clinical features on admission is strongly associated with progression to severe disease or death in a US cohort of COVID-19 patients. Younger patients have distinct risk factors for poor outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.
