    "text": "Nashville: Middle Tennessee State University has issued the following news\nrelease:\n\nMiddle Tennessee baseball player Fausto Lopez joined the Blue Raiders after\nplaying two seasons at Pensacola State College. The Brooklyn, N.Y., native\nracked up a .282 batting average at the JUCO level and swiped 23 bases in his\nfinal season with the Pirates.\n\nLopez started all of the Blue Raiders' 17 games at shortstop in 2020 and got\noff to a hot start with a team high 12 hits in the month of February. When the\nseason came to an abrupt end, Lopez tied with fellow JUCO transfer Nathan\nSanders with a team high five multi-hit games.\n\nIn 2019 you had 11 doubles, three home runs, and 23 stolen bases in your final\nseason at Pensacola State College, what are some benefits of playing at the\nJUCO level before transferring to a Division I program?\n\nThe number one thing that just jumps into my head is for sure the work ethic,\nand everybody always talks about the JUCO grind. It isn't made up, it isn't\nfake, it isn't something JUCO guys say to try and be cool, it's a true thing.\nThere are certain things at the Division I level that I wasn't appreciative of\nuntil I went to a junior college, then I realized that we have so much\navailable to us [coming from the JUCO level] that you've got to be grateful\nfor what we have and still continue to grind. I feel like one thing is to just\nkeep your head down and keep working. In JUCO there weren't any [media]\ninterviews, there wasn't a conviction of everyone in the school like there is\nat MT. Playing at a JUCO made me one: appreciative of everything I've had\nevery step of the way, and two: just to grind, keep your head down, and focus\non your craft above all else.\n\nAt the beginning of the season you were hitting in the ninth spot in the\nlineup, but as the season progressed you cemented yourself as the leadoff\nhitter for the Blue Raiders. What was going right for you at the plate and\nwhat was your approach in the batter's box?\n\nThe main thing was confidence from my teammates honestly, it took them because\nthey had more confidence in me than I had in myself. Getting encouragement\nfrom my teammates and them letting me know that they were confident in me\nwhether I failed or succeeded got me right in the batter's box.\n\nYou and teammate Brian Dillingham started the majority of games up the middle\nfor MT. Both of you guys are JUCO guys, both played in Florida, are there some\nother similarities that you guys bonded over as a double play duo?\n\nFor sure, we also knew some of the same people. A guy that I went to high\nschool with rand was very good friends with went to junior college with him\nand he was very good friends with Brian. We didn't find out that mutual\nconnection until a month into the fall semester. I was like '\"wait, you went\nto school with Ty Hoyle,'\" and he was like \"'yeah, I love Ty.\"' That led to us\nstarting to talk to Ty more through that, and Brian and I will call up Ty\nwhenever we're together. That and practicing every single day, going through\neverything together in the weight room and training, and eating, we spent so\nmuch time together. I actually just got off the phone from talking with Brian\nmaybe 30 minutes ago. It's crazy the bond that we formed through the whole\nprocess.\n\nHead Coach Jim Toman talked during the season about \"putting together complete\ngames,\" meaning hitting well, playing solid defense, and having quality\npitching. As the season progressed we stared to see more and more of those\ncomplete games come together. What kind of confidence does it give the team\nwhen you all are fire on all cylinders like you guys were heading into\nconference play?\n\nIt gave us a lot of confidence. I've always thought to myself the team is\ngoing to be as good as their leader. Yes, there are down years, but Coach\nToman as a leader believed in us before we even knew what we had. We had a\nwhole bunch of JUCO guys come in, and yeah we had an idea that we might be\npretty good, but Coach Toman was preaching that from the get-go. It goes to\nthe point where, us hearing that everyday, we had no choice but to believe and\nplay with confidence. It's either that or you're just not tuned in at\npractice. He did a good job of humbling us down when he needed to, but at the\nsame time he instilled confidence in us from day one. With a leader like that\nthere is no other way to play other than to say 'we don't care who is in the\nother dugout, we want to put our name out there.'\n\nNow that the semester has come to a conclusion what are some things that you\nare doing in your down time?\n\nI haven't been able to go home yet with the whole Coronavirus thing. I'm\nhoping to be able to go home. I live in Brooklyn, N.Y. and my parents have\nbeen up there. I came to Orlando to stay with my cousin and he's been on a\ndiet kind of deal and for some reason that translated into me. During lockdown\nI've been in the kitchen a lot, learning how to cook healthy, doing stuff like\nmeal prepping, and I feel like that's going to help out a lot. I've also been\nconnected to my church through Zoom. My church is in New York, but we all stay\nconnected through Zoom now that you can't go to church in person. All of that,\nworking out, hitting, fielding ground balls and all that stuff.\n\nWhat are some things you're looking to improve on before next season?\n\nI'm focused on getting back and getting my body in even better shape and being\nready to attack the year. I want to be a positive teammate. I want my\nteammates to look at me and be like, '\"that dude works hard.'\"",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tn.nashvl\">Nashville</location>: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3136255059\">Middle Tennessee State University</org> has issued the\nfollowing news release:</p>\n\n<p>Middle <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tn\">Tennessee</location> baseball player <person>Fausto Lopez</person> joined the Blue\nRaiders after playing two seasons at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0639046605\">Pensacola State College</org>. The\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.brklyn\">Brooklyn, N.Y.</location>, native racked up a .282 batting average at the JUCO\nlevel and swiped 23 bases in his final season with the <org>Pirates</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Lopez started all of the Blue Raiders' 17 games at shortstop\nin 2020 and got off to a hot start with a team high 12 hits in the month\nof February. When the season came to an abrupt end, Lopez tied with\nfellow JUCO transfer <person>Nathan Sanders</person> with a team high five multi-hit\ngames.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 you had 11 doubles, three home runs, and 23 stolen bases in\nyour final season at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0639046605\">Pensacola State College</org>, what are some benefits of\nplaying at the JUCO level before transferring to a Division I program?</p>\n\n<p>The number one thing that just jumps into my head is for sure the\nwork ethic, and everybody always talks about the JUCO grind. It\nisn't made up, it isn't fake, it isn't something JUCO\nguys say to try and be cool, it's a true thing. There are certain\nthings at the Division I level that I wasn't appreciative of until\nI went to a junior college, then I realized that we have so much\navailable to us [coming from the JUCO level] that you've got to be\ngrateful for what we have and still continue to grind. I feel like one\nthing is to just keep your head down and keep working. In JUCO there\nweren't any [media] interviews, there wasn't a conviction of\neveryone in the school like there is at MT. Playing at a JUCO made me\none: appreciative of everything I've had every step of the way, and\ntwo: just to grind, keep your head down, and focus on your craft above\nall else.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the season you were hitting in the ninth spot\nin the lineup, but as the season progressed you cemented yourself as the\nleadoff hitter for the Blue Raiders. What was going right for you at the\nplate and what was your approach in the batter's box?</p>\n\n<p>The main thing was confidence from my teammates honestly, it took\nthem because they had more confidence in me than I had in myself.\nGetting encouragement from my teammates and them letting me know that\nthey were confident in me whether I failed or succeeded got me right in\nthe batter's box.</p>\n\n<p>You and teammate <person>Brian Dillingham</person> started the majority of games up\nthe middle for MT. Both of you guys are JUCO guys, both played in\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, are there some other similarities that you guys bonded over as\na double play duo?</p>\n\n<p>For sure, we also knew some of the same people. A guy that I went\nto high school with rand was very good friends with went to junior\ncollege with him and he was very good friends with Brian. We didn't\nfind out that mutual connection until a month into the fall semester. I\nwas like '\"wait, you went to school with <person>Ty Hoyle</person>,'\"\nand he was like \"'yeah, I love Ty.\"' That led to us\nstarting to talk to Ty more through that, and Brian and I will call up\nTy whenever we're together. That and practicing every single day,\ngoing through everything together in the weight room and training, and\neating, we spent so much time together. I actually just got off the\nphone from talking with Brian maybe 30 minutes ago. It's crazy the\nbond that we formed through the whole process.</p>\n\n<p>Head Coach <person>Jim Toman</person> talked during the season about \"putting\ntogether complete games,\" meaning hitting well, playing solid\ndefense, and having quality pitching. As the season progressed we stared\nto see more and more of those complete games come together. What kind of\nconfidence does it give the team when you all are fire on all cylinders\nlike you guys were heading into conference play?</p>\n\n<p>It gave us a lot of confidence. I've always thought to myself\nthe team is going to be as good as their leader. Yes, there are down\nyears, but <person>Coach Toman</person> as a leader believed in us before we even knew\nwhat we had. We had a whole bunch of JUCO guys come in, and yeah we had\nan idea that we might be pretty good, but <person>Coach Toman</person> was preaching that\nfrom the get-go. It goes to the point where, us hearing that everyday,\nwe had no choice but to believe and play with confidence. It's\neither that or you're just not tuned in at practice. He did a good\njob of humbling us down when he needed to, but at the same time he\ninstilled confidence in us from day one. With a leader like that there\nis no other way to play other than to say 'we don't care who\nis in the other dugout, we want to put our name out there.'</p>\n\n<p>Now that the semester has come to a conclusion what are some things\nthat you are doing in your down time?</p>\n\n<p>I haven't been able to go home yet with the whole Coronavirus\nthing. I'm hoping to be able to go home. I live in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ny.brklyn\">Brooklyn, N.Y.</location>\nand my parents have been up there. I came to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> to stay with my\ncousin and he's been on a diet kind of deal and for some reason\nthat translated into me. During lockdown I've been in the kitchen a\nlot, learning how to cook healthy, doing stuff like meal prepping, and I\nfeel like that's going to help out a lot. I've also been\nconnected to my church through Zoom. My church is in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ny\">New York</location>, but we\nall stay connected through Zoom now that you can't go to church in\nperson. All of that, working out, hitting, fielding ground balls and all\nthat stuff.</p>\n\n<p>What are some things you're looking to improve on before next\nseason?</p>\n\n<p>I'm focused on getting back and getting my body in even better\nshape and being ready to attack the year. I want to be a positive\nteammate. I want my teammates to look at me and be like,\n'\"that dude works hard.'\"</p>",
