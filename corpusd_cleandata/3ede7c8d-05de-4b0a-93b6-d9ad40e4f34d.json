    "text": "By CHINO S. LEYCO\n\nThe country's approved foreign investments declined in the first-quarter of\nthe year amid massive uncertainty in global capital flows due to coronavirus\npandemic, data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed.\n\nBased on the submissions from six investment promotion agencies, total\ncommitments reached P29.4 billion in January to March this year, lower by 36\npercent compared with P46 billion in the same period last year.\n\nOf the total pledges to the Philippines, three-fourths of the foreign\ninvestments will go Metro Manila and its nearly areas.\n\nThe national capital region cornered the majority with 43.8 percent, while\n17.5 percent should go to southern Luzon and 15.2 percent are committed to\ncentral Luzon.\n\nCentral Mindanao, meanwhile, secured 11.6 percent of the total foreign\ninvestment pledges in the first-quarter.\n\nDuring the three-month period, the bulk of approved foreign investments came\nfrom United Kingdom with P6.14 billion (20.9 percent), United States with\nP5.74 billion (19.6 percent) and China with P4.9 billion (16.7 percent).\n\nThe PSA data were submitted by Board of Investments (BOI), Clark Development\nCorp., Philippine Economic Zone Authority, Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority,\nAuthority of the Freeport Area of Bataan and Cagayan Economic Zone Authority.\n\nNo investment approvals were reported from BOI-Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in\nMuslim Mindanao during the quarter.\n\nBecause of the lower investments pledges, the expected jobs to be generated\nalso fell by 17.6 percent to 34,814 as against the projected 42,245\nemployments registered in the same quarter in 2019.\n\nOut of the anticipated jobs during the quarter, 89 percent would be absorbed\nby projects with foreign interest, the PSA said.\n\nLast year, foreigners pledged P390.1 billion investments to the Philippines,\nup by more than double compared with P183.3 billion in the previous year.\n\nBut with the worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease, the country is\nexpected to take a hit from the health crisis as its economy is projected to\ncontract by 2.0 percent to 3.4 percent.\n\nTo attract investments, the Duterte administration already proposed to\ndrastically reduce the government's corporate income tax by five percentage\npoints from 30 percent to 25 percent beginning July this year.\n\nThe Philippines currently has the highest corporate tax in Southeast Asia.\n\nCAPTION(S):",
