    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Math Daily\nNews \\-- Investigators discuss new findings in mathematics. According to news\nreporting out of Shanghai, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors,\nresearch stated, \"This paper examines the influence that members' preferred\nservice investments have on their decision-making and profits in a dual-\nchannel supply chain.\"\n\nFunders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina.\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of\nShanghai for Science and Technology: \"We discuss changes in the supplier's and\nretailer's decision-making and optimal profits with reference to their\ndifferent preferred service investment combination modes and their different\nleader-follower relationships. We also provide classified comparisons of the\nsupplier's and retailer's optimal profits by referring to four types of\nproduct characteristics combination modes that are assessed across two\nchannels. By providing classifications and comparisons, we put forward\noperational insights for the supplier and retailer who have direct\nimplications for their optimal decisions and profits, including selling\nproducts with higher homogeneity between two channels, choosing the retailer\nas the leader of the supply chain, and confirming appropriate preference\ncombination mode under a certain product characteristics.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We analyze the\ninfluences of the preferred service investment levels as well as preference\nintensities of the supplier and retailer on their strategies and profits in\ntheir respective advantaged states and obtain some enlightenment about the\ncooperation strategies and relationship-building methods of the supplier and\nretailer in the actual process of their participation in the dual-channel\nsupply chain operation.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Preferred Service Investment in the\nDual-Channel Supply Chain: Leader-Follower Relationships and Product\nCharacteristics. _Mathematical Problems in Engineering_ , 2020,2020.\n(Mathematical Problems in Engineering -\n<https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/>).

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Math Daily News</org> -- Investigators discuss new findings in mathematics.

We also provide classified comparisons of the supplier&#8217;s and retailer&#8217;s optimal profits by referring to four types of product characteristics combination modes that are assessed across two channels. By providing classifications and comparisons, we put forward operational insights for the supplier and retailer who have direct implications for their optimal decisions and profits, including selling products with higher homogeneity between two channels, choosing the retailer as the leader of the supply chain, and confirming appropriate preference combination mode under a certain product characteristics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;We analyze the influences of the preferred service investment levels as well as preference intensities of the supplier and retailer on their strategies and profits in their respective advantaged states and obtain some enlightenment about the cooperation strategies and relationship-building methods of the supplier and retailer in the actual process of their participation in the dual-channel supply chain operation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: <org>Preferred Service Investment</org> in the Dual-Channel Supply Chain: Leader-Follower Relationships and Product Characteristics. <em>Mathematical Problems in Engineering</em>, 2020,2020.
