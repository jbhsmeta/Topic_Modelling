    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at AIDS Daily \\--\nFrom Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a patent application by\nthe inventors WRING, Steve (South Boston, VA); ALONSO-GALICIA, Magdalena\n(Durham, NC); PACK, Thomas (Durham, NC); RURKA, Julie (Raleigh, NC);\nCARPENTER, David (Durham, NC); RHODES, Melissa (Raleigh, NC), filed on\nNovember 15, 2019, was made available online on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee is ALTAVANT SCIENCES GmbH (Basel, Switzerland).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"The present disclosure relates to a method for\ntreating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and associated pulmonary\narterial hypertension (APAH) in a patient. The present disclosure further\nrelates to a method for treating PAH/APAH via a systemic administration to a\npatient.\n\n\"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one form of a broader condition\nknown as pulmonary hypertension, which means high blood pressure in the lungs.\nIn PAH, increased pressure in the vessels is caused by obstruction in small\narteries in the lungs and/or constriction or narrowing in diameter, which\nincreases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. Over time, the\nincreased blood pressure can damage the heart. In many cases of pulmonary\narterial hypertension, the cause is unknown. Others causes can be drug-\nrelated, HIV infection, and connective tissue/autoimmune disorders (such as\nscleroderma).\n\n\"A type of PAH is associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH). APAH can\nbe PAH associated with other medical conditions including, for example, (1)\ncollagen vascular disease (or connective tissue disease) which include\nautoimmune diseases such as scleroderma or lupus; (2) congenital heart and\nlung disease; (3) portal hypertension (e.g., resulting from liver disease);\n(4) HIV infection; (5) drugs (e.g., appetite suppressants, cocaine, and\namphetamines; (6) other conditions including thyroid disorders, glycogen\nstorage disease, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,\nhernoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, and splenectomy. APAH can\nalso be PAH associated with abnormal narrowing in the pulmonary veins and/or\ncapillaries such as in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary\ncapillary hemangiomatosis.\n\n\"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that modulates\ncentral and peripheral functions by acting on neurons, smooth muscle, and\nother cell types. 5-HT is involved in the control and modulation of multiple\nphysiological and psychological processes, including in lung and pulmonary\ndiseases. The literature discloses the relationship between 5-HT and pulmonary\ndiseases at PloS One, e31617 7, (2012), 'The Role of Circulating Serotonin in\nthe Development of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease' and Thorax 161-168,\n54 (1999), 'Role of Serotonin in the Pathogenesis of Acute and Chronic\nPulmonary Hypertension'.\n\n\"The rate-limiting step in 5-HT biosynthesis is the hydroxylation of\ntryptophan by dioxygen, which is catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC\n1.14.16.4) in the presence of the cofactor\n(6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). The resulting oxidized\nproduct, 5-hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTT) is subsequently decarboxylated by an\naromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD; EC 4.1.1.28) to produce 5-HT.\nTogether with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),\nTPH belongs to the pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family.\n\n\"Two vertebrate isoforms of TPH, namely TPH1 and TPH2, have been identified.\nTPH1 is primarily expressed in the pineal gland and non-neuronal tissues, such\nas entei chromaffin (EC) cells located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\nTPH2 (the dominant form in the brain) is expressed exclusively in neuronal\ncells, such as dorsal raphe or myenteric plexus cells. The peripheral and\ncentral systems involved in 5-HT biosynthesis are isolated, with 5-HT being\nunable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the pharmacological\neffects of 5-HT can be modulated by agents affecting TPH in the periphery,\nmainly TPH1 in the gut.\n\n\"WO 2015/035113 and U.S. Pat. No. 9,199,994 disclose spirocyclic compounds\nthat act as inhibitors of THP and are useful in the treatment of various\ndiseases and disorders associated with peripheral serotonin, including\ncardiovascular diseases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and\nassociated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH).\n\n\"However, there is a need for a method of treating or preventing PAH/APAH in a\npatient. There is further a need for a method of treating or preventing\nPAH/APAH in a patient with a systemic administration of a pharmaceutical\ncompound or composition effective in modulating or ameliorating the effects of\nPAH/APAH. There is yet further a need for a method of treating or preventing\nPAH/APAH in a patient with a pharmaceutical compound or composition containing\na THP1 inhibitor.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for\nthis patent application: \"According to the present disclosure, there is\nprovided a method of treating or preventing PAH/APAH in a patient.

The present disclosure further relates to a method for treating PAH/APAH via a systemic administration to a patient.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one form of a broader condition known as pulmonary hypertension, which means high blood pressure in the lungs. In PAH, increased pressure in the vessels is caused by obstruction in small arteries in the lungs and/or constriction or narrowing in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. Over time, the increased blood pressure can damage the heart. In many cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the cause is unknown. Others causes can be drug-related, HIV infection, and connective tissue/autoimmune disorders (such as scleroderma).</p>\n<p>&#8220;A type of PAH is associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH). APAH can be PAH associated with other medical conditions including, for example, (1) collagen vascular disease (or connective tissue disease) which include autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma or lupus; (2) congenital heart and lung disease; (3) portal hypertension (e.g., resulting from liver disease); (4) HIV infection; (5) drugs (e.g., appetite suppressants, cocaine, and amphetamines; (6) other conditions including thyroid disorders, glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, hernoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders, and splenectomy. APAH can also be PAH associated with abnormal narrowing in the pulmonary veins and/or capillaries such as in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that modulates central and peripheral functions by acting on neurons, smooth muscle, and other cell types. 5-HT is involved in the control and modulation of multiple physiological and psychological processes, including in lung and pulmonary diseases. The literature discloses the relationship between 5-HT and pulmonary diseases at PloS One, e31617 7, (2012), &#8216;The Role of Circulating Serotonin in the Development of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#8217; and Thorax 161-168, 54 (1999), &#8216;Role of Serotonin in the Pathogenesis of Acute and Chronic Pulmonary Hypertension&#8217;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rate-limiting step in 5-HT biosynthesis is the hydroxylation of tryptophan by dioxygen, which is catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC 1.14.16.4) in the presence of the cofactor (6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). The resulting oxidized product, 5-hydroxy tryptophan (5-HTT) is subsequently decarboxylated by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD; EC 4.1.1.28) to produce 5-HT. Together with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), TPH belongs to the pterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Two vertebrate isoforms of TPH, namely TPH1 and TPH2, have been identified. TPH1 is primarily expressed in the pineal gland and non-neuronal tissues, such as entei chromaffin (EC) cells located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. TPH2 (the dominant form in the brain) is expressed exclusively in neuronal cells, such as dorsal raphe or myenteric plexus cells. The peripheral and central systems involved in 5-HT biosynthesis are isolated, with 5-HT being unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the pharmacological effects of 5-HT can be modulated by agents affecting TPH in the periphery, mainly TPH1 in the gut.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WO 2015/035113 and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Pat. No. 9,199,994 disclose spirocyclic compounds that act as inhibitors of THP and are useful in the treatment of various diseases and disorders associated with peripheral serotonin, including cardiovascular diseases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH).</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, there is a need for a method of treating or preventing PAH/APAH in a patient.
