    "text": "HARRISBURG \\- The Pennsylvania Department of Health warned Pennsylvania's\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)\nparticipants of potential scams and cautioned them not to disclose their\npersonal information without verifying the identity of the caller.\n\nAlthough WIC clinics do perform eligibility determinations, they will never\ncall participants to request their bank account information to deposit funds\ndirectly into their accounts.\n\n\"The WIC program provides access to resources for mothers and children across\nPennsylvania and we do not want our WIC participants worried about being taken\nadvantage of \u0096 especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Sec. of Health Dr.\nRachel Levine said. \"We want participants to be alert, but know their\ninformation is protected and their benefits will continue to be distributed\nthrough secure means. Please be aware of potential scammers looking to steal\npersonal information and report their number so more Pennsylvanians do not\nhave this experience.\"\n\nIf a WIC participant is unsure if a request for information is legitimate they\nshould contact their local WIC office. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WIC\nservices will be available over the phone or by virtual appointments until\ncounties reopen into the green phase. Residents can find the address, hours of\noperation, and contact information for their local WIC clinic here.\n\nPennsylvanians should report scams to their local law enforcement or file a\nconsumer complaint to the Office of the Attorney General through an online\nform, by calling 800-441-2555, or by email at\n[scams@attorneygeneral.gov](mailto:scams@attorneygeneral.gov).\n\nThe WIC program in Pennsylvania provides services at more than 260 locations\nand serves more than 205,000 pregnant women, infants and children under age 5.\nWIC families shop at more than 1,500 Pennsylvania grocery stores and spend\n$248 million a year with their WIC food benefits. In addition, the program\nalso serves as a gateway for preventive health, and is considered one of the\nmost successful, cost-effective and important nutrition intervention programs\nin the country.\n\nFor more information about WIC, visit [www.pawic.com](http://www.pawic.com) or\ncall 1-800-WIC-WINS. The Pennsylvania WIC program is funded by the United\nStates Department of Agriculture. This institution is an equal opportunity\nprovider.",

Please be aware of potential scammers looking to steal personal information and report their number so more Pennsylvanians do not have this experience.\"</p>\n\n<p>If a WIC participant is unsure if a request for information is legitimate they should contact their local WIC office. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WIC services will be available over the phone or by virtual appointments until counties reopen into the green phase. Residents can find the address, hours of operation, and contact information for their local WIC clinic here.</p>\n\n<p>Pennsylvanians should report scams to their local law enforcement or file a consumer complaint to the <org>Office of the Attorney General</org> through an online form, by calling 800-441-2555, or by email at <a href=\"mailto:scams@attorneygeneral.gov\">scams@attorneygeneral.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The WIC program in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location> provides services at more than 260 locations and serves more than 205,000 pregnant women, infants and children under age 5. WIC families shop at more than 1,500 <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location> grocery stores and spend <money>$248 million</money> a year with their WIC food benefits. In addition, the program also serves as a gateway for preventive health, and is considered one of the most successful, cost-effective and important nutrition intervention programs in the country.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about WIC, visit <a href=\"http://www.pawic.com\">www.pawic.com</a> or call 1-800-WIC-WINS. The Pennsylvania WIC program is funded by the <org>United States Department of Agriculture</org>. This institution is an equal opportunity provider.</p>",
