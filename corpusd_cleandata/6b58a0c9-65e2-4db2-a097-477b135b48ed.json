    "text": "Yellow means proceed with caution.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf announced Friday that Philadelphia and its surrounding counties\nwill be allowed to move into the first phase of his coronavirus reopening plan\nJune 5, though life will still be far from normal.\n\nGyms, spas, barber shops, nail salons, massage parlors, casinos and theaters\nwill still be subject to shutdown orders. Restaurants and bars will still only\nbe able to offer takeout.\n\nRetail stores will be able to reopen but will be required to follow strict\nguidelines similar to measures currently being enforced at grocery stores.\nChild care centers can also resume operations.\n\nAll companies that can conduct their business remotely should continue doing\nso, according to Wolf's plan.\n\nThe stay-at-home order will be lifted, allowing residents to legally leave\ntheir homes for nonessential purposes. Gatherings of more than 25 people will\nstill be prohibited.\n\nCatholic churches in the region will reopen for Mass June 6. The Archdiocese\nof Philadelphia said it is working with health officials on guidance to\nprovide to priests.\n\nWolf's plan calls for a county to be moved to the less-restricted \"green\nphase\" if COVID-19 cases haven't spiked for two weeks.\n\nMayor Jim Kenney said the city would release specific guidance later this week\non how the yellow phase will be handled in Philadelphia.\n\n\"The next two weeks are critical-if we see a spike in cases it will jeopardize\nany hope we have of beginning to reopen,\" Kenney warned in a statement Friday.\n\nPhiladelphia recorded 407 new coronavirus cases Monday and two additional\ndeaths, reflecting two-day totals since the city does not release numbers on\nSundays.\n\nIt's still far above the governor's benchmark for moving to the yellow phase,\nwhich local officials have said would equate to 50 cases a day in the city.\n\nWolf's office, in a statement, said infection rate isn't necessarily the\ndetermining factor. Officials said the state also looked at hospitalizations\nand contact tracing and testing capability.\n\n\"My stay-at-home order did exactly what it was intended to do: It saved lives\nand it bought us valuable time,\" the governor said.\n\nKenney, in a statement reacting to Wolf's announcement, struck a cautious\ntone. He thanked residents for their cooperation but said the work isn't over\nyet.\n\n\"We successfully flattened the curve to prevent a hospital surge, and we\nundoubtedly slowed the spread of COVID-19 and saved many lives,\" Kenney said.\n\"But as we move to the next stage of the response, I need to remind\nPhiladelphians that we are not yet out of the woods. The virus is still very\npresent in our communities.\"\n\nPhiladelphia's COVID-19-related death toll stands at 1,235, and a total of\n21,641 people have caught the virus. About 900 coronavirus patients are being\ntreated at hospitals in the region, including 446 in the city.\n\nOnce southeastern Pennsylvania moves into the yellow phase, no counties in the\nstate will be subject to the stay-at-home order and red phase restrictions.\nState officials on Monday reported 473 additional positive tests and 15\nfatalities.\n\nThe post Yellow phase still brings restrictions appeared first on Metro\nPhiladelphia.",

    "html": "<p>Yellow means proceed with caution.</p>\n<p>Gov. <person>Tom Wolf</person> announced Friday that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> and its surrounding counties will be allowed to move into the first phase of his coronavirus reopening plan <chron>June 5</chron>, though life will still be far from normal.</p>\n\n<p>Gyms, spas, barber shops, nail salons, massage parlors, casinos and theaters will still be subject to shutdown orders. Restaurants and bars will still only be able to offer takeout.</p>\n\n<p>Retail stores will be able to reopen but will be required to follow strict guidelines similar to measures currently being enforced at grocery stores. Child care centers can also resume operations.</p>\n\n<p>All companies that can conduct their business remotely should continue doing so, according to Wolf's plan.</p>\n\n<p>The stay-at-home order will be lifted, allowing residents to legally leave their homes for nonessential purposes. Gatherings of more than 25 people will still be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Catholic churches in the region will reopen for Mass <chron>June 6</chron>. The <location>Archdiocese of Philadelphia</location> said it is working with health officials on guidance to provide to priests.</p>\n\n<p>Wolf's plan calls for a county to be moved to the less-restricted \"green phase\" if COVID-19 cases haven't spiked for two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Mayor <person>Jim Kenney</person> said the city would release specific guidance later this week on how the yellow phase will be handled in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"The next two weeks are critical-if we see a spike in cases it will jeopardize any hope we have of beginning to reopen,\" Kenney warned in a statement Friday.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia</location> recorded 407 new coronavirus cases Monday and two additional deaths, reflecting two-day totals since the city does not release numbers on Sundays.</p>\n\n<p>It's still far above the governor's benchmark for moving to the yellow phase, which local officials have said would equate to 50 cases a day in the city.</p>\n\n<p>Wolf's office, in a statement, said infection rate isn't necessarily the determining factor. Officials said the state also looked at hospitalizations and contact tracing and testing capability.</p>\n\n<p>\"My stay-at-home order did exactly what it was intended to do: It saved lives and it bought us valuable time,\" the governor said.</p>\n\n<p>Kenney, in a statement reacting to Wolf's announcement, struck a cautious tone. He thanked residents for their cooperation but said the work isn't over yet.</p>\n\n<p>\"We successfully flattened the curve to prevent a hospital surge, and we undoubtedly slowed the spread of COVID-19 and saved many lives,\" Kenney said. \"But as we move to the next stage of the response, I need to remind Philadelphians that we are not yet out of the woods. The virus is still very present in our communities.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.pa.phldph\">Philadelphia's</location> COVID-19-related death toll stands at 1,235, and a total of 21,641 people have caught the virus. About 900 coronavirus patients are being treated at hospitals in the region, including 446 in the city.</p>\n\n<p>Once southeastern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.pa\">Pennsylvania</location> moves into the yellow phase, no counties in the state will be subject to the stay-at-home order and red phase restrictions. State officials on Monday reported 473 additional positive tests and 15 fatalities.</p>\n\n<p>The post Yellow phase still brings restrictions appeared first on Metro Philadelphia.</p>",
