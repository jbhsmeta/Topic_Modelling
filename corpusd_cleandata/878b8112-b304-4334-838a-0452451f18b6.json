    "text": "In response to the growing need for emotional and practical support related to\nCOVID-19 in the Greater Santa Barbara area, Hospice Santa Barbara (HSB) now\noffers a comprehensive resource page called Coping With COVID-19. It includes\nvideos and articles by the HSB Community Education staff of dedicated experts,\ntherapists and clergy.\n\nTopics include relevant issues everyone is facing during the global pandemic.\nThe Coping with COVID-19 Series addresses the many emotional and practical\nday-to-day challenges coronavirus is having on all of us including schedules,\nfinances, the lives of our children and family, our plans our control over\nsituations.\n\nThe COVID-19 quarantine is compelling us to face a new kind of loss. We have\nlost all sense of normalcy in our lives. It is a difficult and confusing time.\n\nMany of us feel helpless, and with the uncertainty, emotions can be intense.\nWe've all lost a sense of safety. Many events have been canceled - school,\nchurch services, sports, graduation, weddings.\n\nThe sense of loss from not having loved ones around is especially hard for\nthose giving birth, now happening in isolation, rather than in the presence of\nfamily and friends. Some are suffering the death of a loved one due to this\npandemic, as well as other causes, which makes grieving all the more\ndifficult. There is so much to grieve at this time.\n\nOne way of experiencing COVID-19's impact on our way of living is treating it\nas though it's the death of someone who matters. It can be a reminder of times\nwhen you've been sick. But we aren't sick, nor have we dealt with a recent\ndeath, but the feelings are the same. Life feels surreal in not knowing what\nto expect or how to live in this changed reality.\n\nBeing with grief and death in our work at HSB has informed us about ways to be\nwith loss on a larger scale.\n\nYou may sense feelings coming up inside. It could be fear, anger, guilt,\nshame, anxiety, regret, loneliness, helplessness, yearning, and more. These\nfeelings can happen one at a time or all together in utter confusion. We might\ncycle through different feelings over and over. These are normal reactions to\nloss. We are all grieving the loss of our world as we know it. And grief can\nbe powerful.\n\nWe are being told to socially distance from others, which can create further\nisolation and loss. In grief from death, we encourage people to reach out to\nothers, which is a form of healing in itself. Though we need to physically\ndistance ourselves, social, emotional and spiritual connections are vital.\n\nThis moment in history is an opportunity to develop greater resilience; it is\nan opportunity for growth, deeper connection and intimacy, forgiveness and\ngratitude. There are many possibilities. But first it's important to recognize\nthat this is a major loss, and it's important how we address it.\n\nIt's alright to give ourselves permission to recognize the stories you tell\nourselves during the pandemic. These stories color the way we live through\nthis difficult time. They color how we respond, support each other or not, and\nwhether we will come out more whole in the end.\n\nFor example, a story behind panic might be, \"I won't have what I need, I'll\nstarve,\" or \"I'll never survive this,\" so we buy huge quantities of supplies,\ncreating problems for other people.\n\nOur experience of COVID-19 can either be an opportunity for growth, or a\nrecipe for further disaster. How do we remain calm during these times? One way\nis to check in with yourself by asking:\n\nWhat are my thoughts? They might be, \"This will never end,\" or \"How can I\nhelp?,\" or, \"This is an opportunity to use creative problem-solving skills.\"\n\nWhat are my feelings? This could be fear or anger, sadness, or utter\nconfusion.\n\nWhat is happening in my body? Am I in survival mode of fight or flight or\nfreeze?\n\nCan we tolerate the state we're in with the abruptness of the changed world?\n\nCan we tolerate the feelings that arise in this novel experience?\n\nCan we grow the window of tolerance for our own experiences and for those of\nothers?\n\nCan we allow ourselves to be in this vulnerable place? How do we support\nourselves each other during these challenging times? Consider these methods\nfor helping yourself and others:\n\nSit down, stay calm. Both calm and panic can have a ripple effect. One calm\npresence in the room may be all anyone needs in a crisis.\n\nSet down the terrifying stories about the future you may be telling yourself.\nMost of us are not fortune tellers. Don't pass on rumors. Be in the here and\nnow. Check in with yourself, what are your thoughts, feelings and body\nsensations?\n\nKnow that we are all going through this together. Normalize what you and those\naround you are feeling. These are challenging times. Know your feelings are\nnormal. Try not to over- identify with the feelings you do have. Take a\nbalanced approach to your difficult emotions so that feelings are neither\nbottled-up nor exaggerated. You don't have to act on them.\n\nBe mindful of and acknowledge any feelings that do arise. Name them. If it's\nconfusion, name that.\n\nWe can be physically distant, and still be socially, emotionally, and\nspiritually connected. Reach out to someone over the phone, Skype, FaceTime,\nZoom, or by writing a letter or card\n\nGround yourself and come to your senses: feel your feet on the floor, pressing\nsoftly, really feel the sensations. Breathe through your nose and out your\nmouth, notice five different colors you see, four things you can touch, three\nthings you hear, two things you can smell, one taste you have in your mouth\nnow.\n\nIt's not easy to bear witness to mass suffering. We might feel uneasy, and we\nmight even collude in creating more harm, whether it's anxiety, panic,\njudgment or some other form. Loss stimulates our own fears because we're\nempathic creatures. Recognize this.\n\nIf we're going to support each other in this time of mass loss and grief\nwithout getting lost in it, we need to get to know the terrain of our own\nfeelings and thoughts and not act impulsively. Ask: If I can't tolerate grief\nand loss in myself \u0096 will I be able to tolerate it in others?\n\nIn the beginning when loss is fresh, it can be most confusing; emotions pour\nin too fast to differentiate. We need to sit quietly, shelter in place (in\ngrief we call this \"cocooning\") and listen to ourselves and those who matter\nto us. Be real, share honestly.\n\nGet to know these states in yourself \u0096 sadness, fear, helplessness ... Don't\ntry to take away someone's suffering, just listen. Support others where they\nare. Pay attention. Show up and be present (even virtually). The more we're\naware of our inner terrain, the more present we are able to be. Nonjudgmental\npresence may be all that's needed for now.\n\nAs we heal from this, let curiosity grow. Learn to trust the process of grief.\nIt slows us down and allows us to see things in a new way.\n\nRemember, we are all in this pandemic together, which is showing us our true\ninterdependence and the importance of our human connections. When this is over\nand done, let's not forget the lessons we learn from this era. What we need\nnow is love and compassion.\n\nFor more information about Hospice of Santa Barbara, including volunteer\nopportunities, call (805) 563-8820 or visit\n[www.hospiceofsantabarbara.org](http://www.hospiceofsantabarbara.org).",

    "title": "Hospice Santa Barbara Offers Coping Techniques During Pandemic",
    "html": "<p>In response to the growing need for emotional and practical support related to COVID-19 in the Greater Santa Barbara area, Hospice Santa Barbara (HSB) now offers a comprehensive resource page called Coping With COVID-19. It includes videos and articles by the HSB Community Education staff of dedicated experts, therapists and clergy.</p>\n<p>Topics include relevant issues everyone is facing during the global pandemic. The Coping with COVID-19 Series addresses the many emotional and practical day-to-day challenges coronavirus is having on all of us including schedules, finances, the lives of our children and family, our plans our control over situations.</p>\n\n<p>The COVID-19 quarantine is compelling us to face a new kind of loss. We have lost all sense of normalcy in our lives. It is a difficult and confusing time.</p>\n\n<p>Many of us feel helpless, and with the uncertainty, emotions can be intense. We've all lost a sense of safety. Many events have been canceled - school, church services, sports, graduation, weddings.</p>\n\n<p>The sense of loss from not having loved ones around is especially hard for those giving birth, now happening in isolation, rather than in the presence of family and friends. Some are suffering the death of a loved one due to this pandemic, as well as other causes, which makes grieving all the more difficult. There is so much to grieve at this time.</p>\n\n<p>One way of experiencing COVID-19's impact on our way of living is treating it as though it's the death of someone who matters. It can be a reminder of times when you've been sick. But we aren't sick, nor have we dealt with a recent death, but the feelings are the same. Life feels surreal in not knowing what to expect or how to live in this changed reality.</p>\n\n<p>Being with grief and death in our work at HSB has informed us about ways to be with loss on a larger scale.</p>\n\n<p>You may sense feelings coming up inside. It could be fear, anger, guilt, shame, anxiety, regret, loneliness, helplessness, yearning, and more. These feelings can happen one at a time or all together in utter confusion. We might cycle through different feelings over and over. These are normal reactions to loss. We are all grieving the loss of our world as we know it. And grief can be powerful.</p>\n\n<p>We are being told to socially distance from others, which can create further isolation and loss. In grief from death, we encourage people to reach out to others, which is a form of healing in itself. Though we need to physically distance ourselves, social, emotional and spiritual connections are vital.</p>\n\n<p>This moment in history is an opportunity to develop greater resilience; it is an opportunity for growth, deeper connection and intimacy, forgiveness and gratitude. There are many possibilities. But first it's important to recognize that this is a major loss, and it's important how we address it.</p>\n\n<p>It's alright to give ourselves permission to recognize the stories you tell ourselves during the pandemic. These stories color the way we live through this difficult time. They color how we respond, support each other or not, and whether we will come out more whole in the end.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a story behind panic might be, \"I won't have what I need, I'll starve,\" or \"I'll never survive this,\" so we buy huge quantities of supplies, creating problems for other people.</p>\n\n<p>Our experience of COVID-19 can either be an opportunity for growth, or a recipe for further disaster. How do we remain calm during these times? One way is to check in with yourself by asking:</p>\n\n<p>What are my thoughts? They might be, \"This will never end,\" or \"How can I help?,\" or, \"This is an opportunity to use creative problem-solving skills.\"</p>\n\n<p>What are my feelings? This could be fear or anger, sadness, or utter confusion.</p>\n\n<p>What is happening in my body? Am I in survival mode of fight or flight or freeze?</p>\n\n<p>Can we tolerate the state we're in with the abruptness of the changed world?</p>\n\n<p>Can we tolerate the feelings that arise in this novel experience?</p>\n\n<p>Can we grow the window of tolerance for our own experiences and for those of others?</p>\n\n<p>Can we allow ourselves to be in this vulnerable place? How do we support ourselves each other during these challenging times? Consider these methods for helping yourself and others:</p>\n\n<p>Sit down, stay calm. Both calm and panic can have a ripple effect. One calm presence in the room may be all anyone needs in a crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Set down the terrifying stories about the future you may be telling yourself. Most of us are not fortune tellers. Don't pass on rumors. Be in the here and now. Check in with yourself, what are your thoughts, feelings and body sensations?</p>\n\n<p>Know that we are all going through this together. Normalize what you and those around you are feeling. These are challenging times. Know your feelings are normal. Try not to over- identify with the feelings you do have. Take a balanced approach to your difficult emotions so that feelings are neither bottled-up nor exaggerated. You don't have to act on them.</p>\n\n<p>Be mindful of and acknowledge any feelings that do arise. <org>Name</org> them. If it's confusion, name that.</p>\n\n<p>We can be physically distant, and still be socially, emotionally, and spiritually connected. Reach out to someone over the phone, <org>Skype</org>, FaceTime, Zoom, or by writing a letter or card</p>\n\n<p>Ground yourself and come to your senses: feel your feet on the floor, pressing softly, really feel the sensations. Breathe through your nose and out your mouth, notice five different colors you see, four things you can touch, three things you hear, two things you can smell, one taste you have in your mouth now.</p>\n\n<p>It's not easy to bear witness to mass suffering. We might feel uneasy, and we might even collude in creating more harm, whether it's anxiety, panic, judgment or some other form. Loss stimulates our own fears because we're empathic creatures. Recognize this.</p>\n\n<p>If we're going to support each other in this time of mass loss and grief without getting lost in it, we need to get to know the terrain of our own feelings and thoughts and not act impulsively. Ask: If I can't tolerate grief and loss in myself &#150; will I be able to tolerate it in others?</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning when loss is fresh, it can be most confusing; emotions pour in too fast to differentiate. We need to sit quietly, shelter in place (in grief we call this \"cocooning\") and listen to ourselves and those who matter to us. Be real, share honestly.</p>\n\n<p>Get to know these states in yourself &#150; sadness, fear, helplessness ... Don't try to take away someone's suffering, just listen. Support others where they are. Pay attention. Show up and be present (even virtually). The more we're aware of our inner terrain, the more present we are able to be. Nonjudgmental presence may be all that's needed for now.</p>\n\n<p>As we heal from this, let curiosity grow. Learn to trust the process of grief. It slows us down and allows us to see things in a new way.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, we are all in this pandemic together, which is showing us our true interdependence and the importance of our human connections. When this is over and done, let's not forget the lessons we learn from this era. What we need now is love and compassion.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about <org>Hospice of Santa Barbara</org>, including volunteer opportunities, call (805) 563-8820 or visit <a href=\"http://www.hospiceofsantabarbara.org\">www.hospiceofsantabarbara.org</a>.</p>",
