    "text": "Unions vote to strike at Tata Steel, without hard guarantees on jobsJune 5,\n2020The steel works dominate the surrounding area. Photo: Dutch.nlSteel\nworkers at the Tata Steel plant in IJmuiden have voted unanimously to go on\nstrike if management do not respond to their questions about the future of the\ncompany in the Netherlands, and the sudden departure of chief executive Theo\nHenrar.In particular,the unions want guaranteesThey also want assurances that\nadmin work at the IJmuiden plant is not contracted out to third parties and\nthat there is a strategic plan drawn up for the future of Tata Steel\nNederland.The central works council has already said it will take legal action\nif sidelined during the process to find a successor Henrar, who left suddenly\nlast month.Henrar, whose departure prompted a spontaneous blockade by staff,\nis known as a defender of the Dutch company's interests and has campaigned\nagainst plans to shift jobs to India and further integrate the British and\nDutch activities.In April Tata Steel said it was delaying a planned\nreorganisation of its European arm until July at least, because of the\ncoronavirus crisis. The company had wanted to cut 3,000 jobs and slash costs\nin an effort to restore profitability. Almost 1,000 of the 11,000 jobs in\nIJmuiden would have been scrapped.Earlier this week the company confirmed\nthere will be no compulsory redundancies in IJmuiden when the company\nreorganises and the current pact on jobs - which runs until October 2021 -\nwill be respected.Thank you for donating to Dutch.nlThe Dutch.nl team would\nlike to thank all the generous readers who have made a donation in recent\nweeks. Your financial support has helped us to expand our coverage of the\ncoronavirus crisis into the evenings and weekends and make sure you are kept\nup to date with the latest developments.If you have not yet made a donation,\nbut would like to,",

Photo: Dutch.nlSteel workers at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Bombay:890144\">Tata Steel</org> plant in IJmuiden have voted unanimously to go on strike if management do not respond to their questions about the future of the company in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/nl\">the Netherlands</location>, and the sudden departure of chief executive Theo Henrar.In particular,the unions want guaranteesThey also want assurances that admin work at the IJmuiden plant is not contracted out to third parties and that there is a strategic plan drawn up for the future of Tata Steel Nederland.The central works council has already said it will take legal action if sidelined during the process to find a successor Henrar, who left suddenly last month.Henrar, whose departure prompted a spontaneous blockade by staff, is known as a defender of the Dutch company&#8217;s interests and has campaigned against plans to shift jobs to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/in\">India</location> and further integrate the British and Dutch activities.In <person>April Tata Steel</person> said it was delaying a planned reorganisation of its European arm until July at least, because of the coronavirus crisis. The company had wanted to cut 3,000 jobs and slash costs in an effort to restore profitability. Almost 1,000 of the 11,000 jobs in IJmuiden would have been scrapped.Earlier this week the company confirmed there will be no compulsory redundancies in IJmuiden when the company reorganises and the current pact on jobs &#8211; which runs until <chron>October 2021</chron> &#8211; will be respected.Thank you for donating to Dutch.nlThe Dutch.nl team would like to thank all the generous readers who have made a donation in recent weeks.
