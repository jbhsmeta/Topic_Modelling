    "text": "The rising severity and intensity of natural catastrophes, amplified by\nclimate change, in California, Florida and Texas have brought about some\ninsurance, regulatory and building code changes in those states.\n\nOver the years, Florida, Texas and California have been especially hard hit by\nrecord-breaking natural perils, which have been amplified by climate change.\nThose events have driven a number of insurance, regulatory and building code\nchanges in those states.\n\nSeveral global trends are \"colliding to create the perfect storm\" for growing\naccumulation of hurricanes and other natural catastrophe risks, said Mohit\nPande, head of property underwriting at Swiss Re. Among them, he said, are\neconomic growth and urban development in low-line coastal\n\nKey Points\n\nCostly Catastrophes: The number of billion-dollar natural catastrophes\ncontinues to rise in the United States.\n\nWeathering the Storm:\n\nPopulation growth, climate change and other factors are driving a rise in\nthose events in states such as California, Florida and Texas, and spurring the\nneed for legislation and reform.\n\nFighting Back: Some states are implementing new building codes, while others\nare making changes to their private flood insurance market or requiring homes\nto be built with flame retardant features to withstand wildfires. regions,\nflood plains and wildfire urban interfaces, along with climate change, which\nis fueling the intensity of natural disasters and driving a rise in secondary\nperils such as floods, droughts and wildfires.\n\nLast year, natural catastrophes, driven in part by changing weather patterns,\ncaused overall losses of $150 billion, including insured losses of about $52\nbillion, according to Munich Re.\n\nExperts say that's only the beginning.\n\nWithin the next five years, the threat of climate change could potentially\ncost some of the world's largest companies $1 trillion, according to estimates\nby environmental nonprofit CDP North America.\n\nAlthough the science of climate change and its impact on natural catastrophes\nremain somewhat nascent, experts point to a number of probabilities linking\nthe two together.\n\nWarmer temperatures are intensifying precipitation and floods, while changing\nwind patterns have been shifting the threat of tornadoes from what's known as\nTornado Alley in the Great Plains to Dixieland states such as Alabama,\nTennessee and Mississippi, said Dr. Peter Sousounis, vice president and\ndirector of climate change research at risk-modeling solutions provider AIR\nWorldwide.\n\nColorado State University researchers pin this year's projected rise in\nhurricanes on warmer sea temperatures and the absence of El Nino.\n\nLast year marked the seventh year in the past decade with 10 or more $1\nbillion-plus weather climate events, including powerful tornadoes in Texas and\nOhio, Hurricane Dorian that hard-hit the Bahamas and Typhoon Hagibis in Japan,\naccording to CoreLogic's 2019 Natural Hazard Report.\n\nThe good news is that global insured losses are estimated to be around $56\nbillion in 2019, down from $93 billion in 2018 and below the annual average\n($75 billion) of the previous 10 years, according to Swiss Reinsurance\nInstitute.\n\nBest's Review takes a closer look at some of the recent reforms put in place\nin the aftermath of several high-loss events in the three states.\n\nFlorida\n\nAfter Hurricane Andrew barreled down on Miami-Dade County on Aug. 24, 1992,\nracking up more than $15 billion in claims payouts, the historic storm\nrevealed deficiencies in Florida's existing building code compliance and\nenforcement process.\n\nTen years later Florida legislators implemented the first statewide building\ncode mandating new structures be built to withstand hurricane-force winds and\ninclude features such as storm shutters and impact-resistant windows.\n\nSince then, a number of amendments have been made to the Florida Building\nCode, including a new directive that, beginning on Jan. 1, 2021, will require\na sealed roof deck as a secondary water barrier on all new structures.\n\nToday Florida's uniform building code is among the strongest in the nation,\nand the rising severity of catastrophes across the state is continually\ntesting the resiliency of those standards.\n\nRecent storms like Hurricane Irma in 2017 and\n\nHurricane Michael in 2018 have proven that the codes are up to the challenge,\nsaid Arnie Mascali, president of Brown & Brown subsidiary Procor Solutions.\n\nWhile Michael brought winds \"stronger than what's required for [testing the]\nbuildings,\" both Irma and Michael revealed the damage water intrusion causes\nwhen roof cover is lost, Anne Cope, chief engineer at the Insurance Institute\nfor Business & Home Safety Research Center, said.\n\nIn response, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has made additional\nrecommendations for homes built after the first adoption of the Florida\nBuilding Code in 2002, including enhanced wind resistance of roof coverings, a\nsecondary underlayment system to prevent water intrusion and improvements to\nthe performance of asphalt shingles.\n\nThe Sunshine State has also been hard hit by a growing number of climatic\ndisasters including droughts, wildfires and floods. For years Floridians\nlooking for flood insurance had only one place to turn: the National Flood\nInsurance Program. As of Sept. 30, 2019, there were almost 83,000 private\nflood insurance policies in force in the state, according to Florida's Office\nof Insurance Regulation.\n\nNew developments regarding flooding include:\n\n* The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation has made the development of the private flood market a priority in the state, said OIR press secretary Karen Kees. The office encourages companies to participate as flood writers, helps facilitate the development of additional flood insurance options for consumers and has streamlined form and rate filing procedures to make products available on the market quickly.\n\n* Last June, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill that revises circumstances under which insurers issuing homeowners insurance policies must include a specified statement relating to flood insurance with policy documents at initial issuance and renewals.\n\nThe rising severity and intensity of floods and other natural perils in\nFlorida are caused by several factors, including population growth, climate\nchange and the state's history of natural variability, said Karen Clark, CEO\nof catastrophe modeler Karen Clark & Company.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Florida was hit by an unprecedented eight named storms,\nincluding hurricanes Wilma, Ivan and Charley.That period was then followed by\na 10-year lull of land-falling hurricanes.\n\nBut the respite came to a screeching halt in 2016 with Hurricane Matthew,\nfollowed by Irma and Michael, \"proving that a quiet period can suddenly become\nactive again,\" Clark said.\n\nAs of October 2019, Hurricane Michael resulted in more than 149,700 claims and\nmore than $7.4 billion in estimated insured losses, according to OIR. However,\nnearly 10% of those claims remain open.\n\nDispleased with the number of unresolved claims, subcommittees in the Florida\nSenate and House earlier this year considered a new wide-ranging consumer\nprotection bill that would make more than 20 amendments to Florida's insurance\nregulations, such as requiring surplus lines insurers to pay or deny claims\nwithin 90 days and increasing the cooling-off period during which a consumer\nmay cancel a contract with a public adjuster from three or five days to seven\ncalendar days.\n\nHowever, the bill failed to pass during the recent state legislative session\nthat concluded March 13.\n\nOver the years, there has been exponential growth in assignment of benefits\nlitigation in Florida.\n\nAccording to a release on Gov. DeSantis' website, there were approximately 90\nproperty AOB lawsuits filed statewide in 2008, but by 2018, the number of\nlawsuits had increased by more than 19,000%.\n\nFlorida law permits homeowners to sign over their rights to contractors or\nauto repair shops so they can receive direct payment from an insurer. However,\noften the amount of those claims are disputed and wind up in court.\n\nWhile increasing AOB litigation has become a taxing burden on first-party\ninsurers, it's also saddling some state property owners with rising homeowners\ninsurance premiums.\n\nLast May DeSantis signed into a law the Insurance Assignment Agreements bill\nthat establishes a series of reforms that address AOB abuse.\n\nThe legislation gives an insured 14 days to rescind an assignment without\npenalty, and gives the insured 30 days to rescind the assignment if the\nassignee has not begun substantial work during that 30 days. Also, assignees\nare required to provide a copy of the assignment agreement to the insurer\nwithin three days.\n\nThe rule also places a $3,000, or 1% of Coverage A, cap, whichever is greater,\non emergency repair AOB invoices.\n\nExperts expect AOB costs to drive some rate increases in the industry this\nyear.\n\nAM Best in its Feb. 3 Best's Journal report projected June reinsurance\nrenewals to increase 15% to 20% on the heels of rising AOB and other\nlitigation costs and loss creep from prior storms.\n\nThe rising cost of reinsurance has already led several of the state's\nhomeowners insurers to request rate increases earlier this year, some by as\nmuch as 28%.\n\nTexas\n\nIn 2017, Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on Texas,\nflooding large swaths of Houston, Beaumont and other areas of the state.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that over the past century,\naverage annual rainfall in the eastern two-thirds of Texas has continued to\nrise. Harvey eclipsed those average amounts to become a 1,000-year flood\nevent, signaling the need for tougher flood-risk mitigation requirements and\nchanges to the state's private flood insurance market.\n\nNearly 400,000 homeowners lacked flood insurance at the time of the storm,\nleaving losses largely on the shoulders of the already financially troubled\nNational Flood Insurance Program, which is part of FEMA.\n\nThe Insurance Information Institute reports FEMA paid out $8.9 billion in\nclaims filed by 76,000 NFIP policyholders living in the Harvey flood zone.\n\nFlood insurance sales in the state rose 18% from July 2017 to May 2018,\naccording to FEMA.\n\nAlso on the heels of the mammoth storm have been a number of changes by state\nregulators to improve resilience and recovery after hurricanes and floods,\nincluding:\n\n* House Bill 1900, which was passed last spring during the only state legislative session to be held since Harvey, allots policyholders additional time to determine final repair costs and permits them to work with the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association if its estimates aren't enough to cover the repair, said Texas Department of Insurance press secretary Jerry Hagins. Also under the new rule, he said, TWIA policyholders have more time to request an appraisal to resolve payment disputes.\n\n* Hagins said also during last year's legislative session, several laws were passed that now require homeowners insurers to indicate in their policies if flood is not a covered peril, and allow surplus lines companies to write flood insurance without requiring two rejections in the regular market.\n\nWhile industry experts laud those measures, some point to the need for\nadditional overhauls in the disaster-prone state, including a statewide\nbuilding code and uniform minimum construction standards.\n\nA recent review of coastal Texas building codes by the Insurance Institute for\nBusiness & Home Safety revealed gaps that could leave one-third of homeowners\nliving in coastal counties at risk if mitigation efforts and modern building\ncodes aren't developed.\n\nTexas, unlike Florida, lacks a statewide building code, leaving the adoption\nand enforcement of those standards up to city and county officials.\n\nWhile 21 cities surveyed in the IBHS study have adopted a code, only 20% of\ncounties have adopted a standard, leaving more than 840,000 residents in areas\noutside city limits with no adopted residential building code, according to\nCope.\n\nShe said that is driving the need for more investment in mitigation \"to bridge\nthe gap and help vulnerable coastal communities build stronger.\"\n\nState insurance regulators hope new construction standards set to go into\neffect later this year will help to close that gap for coastal homeowners.\n\nEarlier this year, the Texas Department of Insurance announced it was moving\nto newer standards that will provide greater windstorm protection to homes and\nbuildings built along the Gulf Coast. The standards, designated for new\nstructures or property repairs by owners seeking insurance coverage from the\nTWIA, were set to begin on April 1. But because of business disruption caused\nby the COVID-19 pandemic, TDI has decided to push back the start date to Sept.\n1.\n\nCalifornia\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, wildfires razed northern areas of California.\n\nThe Tubbs Fire ravaged more than 36,000 acres of land, destroyed more than\n5,600 structures and claimed 22 lives in 2017, according to the California\nDepartment of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire's destructiveness was\nsurpassed the following year when the Camp Fire became the deadliest and most\ndestructive wildfire in state history and was the single costliest global\nnatural disaster for insurers in 2018.\n\nThomas Holzheu, Swiss Re's chief economist for the Americas, points to warmer\ntemperatures and housing growth in wildfire urban interfaces as fueling the\nrise in those and other recent wildfires.\n\nSince 2017, fires across the state have set off a domino effect that includes\nsome insurers pulling out of the market, a reduction in capacity, and a rise\nin homeowners insurance prices and policy nonrenewals.\n\nIn 2018, nonrenewals in eight counties, including Sierra and San Diego,\nclimbed by 10%, according to the California Department of Insurance.\n\nBut out of the ruin of the fires have come some big changes designed to aid\nhomeowners living in fire-prone areas:\n\n* In December 2019, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara issued a mandatory, year-long moratorium, set to expire on Dec. 5, that prohibits insurers from issuing nonrenewal notices to nearly one million policyholders living inside or next to the perimeter of a state-declared wildfire disaster. Lara issued the moratorium amid growing evidence that homeowners insurance has become more difficult for Californians to obtain from traditional markets, forcing them into more expensive, less comprehensive options such as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, the state's insurer of last resort.\n\n* The FAIR Plan has also recently undergone some changes, including an order by Lara last year calling for the plan to offer a comprehensive HO-3 policy in addition to its current fire-only policy; expand residential coverage limits from $1.5 million to $3 million; and offer consumers a monthly payment plan and the ability to pay by credit card or electronic funds transfer, all without fees.\n\nCalifornia wildfires continue to rack up large losses for insurers, including\nmore than $12 billion from the November 2018 fires, according to the\nCalifornia Department of Insurance.\n\nState homeowners insurers, in turn, have been implementing re-underwriting\nmeasures, filing rounds of rate hike requests and exiting fire-prone areas\n\"where not restricted by recent legislative changes,\" according to an April 6\nBest Market Segment Report.\n\nThe authors of the report said many insurers are also continuing to reevaluate\ntheir wildfire underwriting strategies and enhance their reinsurance programs\nto limit exposure concentrations.\n\nWhile improvements have been made to bolster the resilience of those\nstructures, Cope, of IBHS, said even more needs to be done to the state's\nbuilding codes to protect homes in fire-prone areas.\n\n\"Unlike Florida with its strict adoption and enforcement of a uniform building\ncode, and Texas that has yet to adopt a statewide mandate, I believe\nCalifornia lies in the middle with its history of good building codes for wind\nand earthquake perils and the challenge of the increasing severity and limited\ncode provisions for wildfire,\" she said.\n\nState legislators are hoping to change that. Last October, California passed\nseveral bills that encourage communities to adopt standards for making homes\nand their surroundings more fire resistant.\n\nOne of the new rules encourages home hardening efforts through a California\nWildfire Mitigation Financial Assistance Program for communities in forest and\nbrush areas across the state, while another creates statewide defensible space\nrequirements to reduce wildfire risks in communities.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom also signed into law last year legislation that creates a\nsingle rule to be used in determining the value of property damage for total\nand partial losses in insurance policies. Prior to the new rule, state\nhomeowners were paid the actual cash value of their home in the event of a\ntotal loss. Now insurance payouts for a total or partial loss are based on the\ncost to repair, rebuild or replace a property, minus a \"fair and reasonable\"\ndeduction for physical depreciation based on its condition at the time of an\nevent.\n\nby Lori Chordas\n\nLori Chordas is a senior associate editor.

and wildfires.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, natural catastrophes, driven in part by changing weather\npatterns, caused overall losses of <money>$150 billion</money>, including insured\nlosses of about <money>$52 billion</money>, according to <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Frankfurt:MUV2\">Munich Re</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Experts say that's only the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Within the next five years, the

to\n<org>Swiss Reinsurance Institute</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Best's Review takes a closer look at some of the recent\nreforms put in place in the aftermath of several high-loss events in the\nthree states.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location></p>\n\n<p>After Hurricane Andrew barreled down on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.miaade\">Miami-Dade County</location> on <chron>Aug.\n24, 1992</chron>, racking up more than <money>$15 billion</money> in claims payouts, the\nhistoric storm revealed deficiencies in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> existing building\ncode compliance and enforcement process.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years later <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> legislators implemented the first statewide\nbuilding code mandating new structures be built to withstand\nhurricane-force winds and include features such as storm shutters and\nimpact-resistant windows.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, a number of amendments have been made to the Florida\n<location>Building Code</location>, including a new directive that, beginning on <chron>Jan. 1,\n2021</chron>, will require a sealed roof deck as a secondary water barrier on\nall new structures.</p>\n\n<p>Today <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> uniform building code is among the strongest\nin the nation, and the rising severity of catastrophes across the state\nis continually testing the resiliency of those standards.</p>\n\n<p>Recent storms like Hurricane Irma in 2017 and</p>\n\n<p>Hurricane Michael in 2018 have proven that the codes are up to the\nchallenge, said <person>Arnie Mascali</person>, president of Brown &amp; Brown subsidiary\nProcor Solutions.</p>\n\n<p>While Michael brought winds \"stronger than what's\nrequired for [testing the] buildings,\" both Irma and Michael\nrevealed the damage water intrusion causes when roof cover is lost, <person>Anne\nCope</person>, chief engineer at the <org>Insurance Institute for Business &amp; Home\nSafety Research Center</org>, said.</p>\n\n<p>In response, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3926532505\">Federal Emergency Management Agency</org> has made\nadditional recommendations for homes built after the first adoption of\nthe Florida <location>Building Code</location> in 2002, including enhanced wind resistance of\nroof coverings, a secondary underlayment system to prevent water\nintrusion and improvements to the performance of asphalt shingles.</p>\n\n<p>The Sunshine State has also been hard hit by a growing number of\nclimatic disasters including droughts, wildfires and floods. For years\nFloridians looking for flood insurance had only one place to turn: the\nNational Flood Insurance Program. As of <chron>Sept. 30, 2019</chron>, there were\nalmost 83,000 private flood insurance policies in force in the state,\naccording to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> <org>Office of Insurance Regulation</org>.</p>\n\n<p>New developments regarding flooding include:</p>\n\n<p>* <org>The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation</org> has made the\ndevelopment of the private flood market a priority in the state, said\nOIR press secretary <person>Karen Kees</person>. The office encourages companies to\nparticipate as flood writers, helps facilitate the development of\nadditional flood insurance options for consumers and has streamlined\nform and rate filing procedures to make products available on the market\nquickly.</p>\n\n<p>* Last June, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> Gov. <person>Ron DeSantis</person> signed a bill that revises\ncircumstances under which insurers issuing homeowners insurance policies\nmust include a specified statement relating to flood insurance with\npolicy documents at initial issuance and renewals.</p>\n\n<p>The rising severity and intensity of floods and other natural\nperils in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> are caused by several factors, including population\ngrowth, climate change and the state's history of natural\nvariability, said <person>Karen Clark</person>, CEO of catastrophe modeler <org>Karen Clark\n&amp; Company</org>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2004 and 2005, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> was hit by an unprecedented eight named\nstorms, including hurricanes Wilma, Ivan and Charley.That period was\nthen followed by a 10-year lull of land-falling hurricanes.</p>\n\n<p>But the respite came to a screeching halt in 2016 with Hurricane\nMatthew, followed by Irma and Michael, \"proving that a quiet period\ncan suddenly become active again,\" Clark said.</p>\n\n<p>As of <chron>October 2019</chron>, Hurricane Michael resulted in more than 149,700\nclaims and more than <money>$7.4 billion</money> in estimated insured losses, according\nto OIR. However, nearly 10% of those claims remain open.</p>\n\n<p>Displeased with the number of unresolved claims, subcommittees in\nthe <org>Florida Senate</org> and House earlier this year considered a new\nwide-ranging consumer protection bill that would make more than 20\namendments to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida's</location> insurance regulations, such as requiring\nsurplus lines insurers to pay or deny claims within 90 days and\nincreasing the cooling-off period during which a consumer may cancel a\ncontract with a public adjuster from three or five days to seven\ncalendar days.</p>\n\n<p>However, the bill failed to pass during the recent state\nlegislative session that concluded <chron>March 13</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, there has been exponential growth in assignment of\nbenefits litigation in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>.</p>\n\n<p>According to a release on <person>Gov. DeSantis'</person> website, there were\napproximately 90 property AOB lawsuits filed statewide in 2008, but by\n2018, the number of lawsuits had increased by more than 19,000%.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> law permits homeowners to sign over their rights to\ncontractors or auto repair shops so they can receive direct payment from\nan insurer. However, often the amount of those claims are disputed and\nwind up in court.</p>\n\n<p>While increasing AOB litigation has become a taxing burden on\nfirst-party insurers, it's also saddling some state property owners\nwith rising homeowners insurance premiums.</p>\n\n<p>Last <person>May DeSantis</person> signed into a law the Insurance Assignment\nAgreements bill that establishes a series of reforms that address AOB\nabuse.</p>\n\n<p>The legislation gives an insured 14 days to rescind an assignment\nwithout penalty, and gives the insured 30 days to rescind the assignment\nif the assignee has not begun substantial work during that 30 days.\nAlso, assignees are required to provide a copy of the assignment\nagreement to the insurer within three days.</p>\n\n<p>The rule also places a <money>$3,000</money>, or 1% of Coverage A, cap, whichever\nis greater, on emergency repair AOB invoices.</p>\n\n<p>Experts expect AOB costs to drive some rate increases in the\nindustry this year.</p>\n\n<p>AM Best in its <chron>Feb. 3</chron> Best's Journal report projected June\nreinsurance renewals to increase 15% to 20% on the heels of rising AOB\nand other litigation costs and loss creep from prior storms.</p>\n\n<p>The rising cost of reinsurance has already led several of the\nstate's homeowners insurers to request rate increases earlier this\nyear, some by as much as 28%.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location></p>\n\n<p>In 2017, Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>, flooding large swaths of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\">Houston</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.beaont\">Beaumont</location> and other areas of the\nstate.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4114923472\">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</org> reports that over the past\ncentury, average annual rainfall in the eastern two-thirds of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> has\ncontinued to rise. Harvey eclipsed those average amounts to become a\n1,000-year flood event, signaling the need for tougher flood-risk\nmitigation requirements and changes to the state's private flood\ninsurance market.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 400,000 homeowners lacked flood insurance at the time of the\nstorm, leaving losses largely on the shoulders of the already\nfinancially troubled National Flood Insurance Program, which is part of\n<org>FEMA</org>.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3472780265\">Insurance Information Institute</org> reports <org>FEMA</org> paid out <money>$8.9\nbillion</money> in claims filed by 76,000 NFIP policyholders living in the\nHarvey flood zone.</p>\n\n<p>Flood insurance sales in the state rose 18% from <chron>July 2017</chron> to <chron>May\n2018</chron>, according to <org>FEMA</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Also on the heels of the mammoth storm have been a number of\nchanges by state regulators to improve resilience and recovery after\nhurricanes and floods, including:</p>\n\n<p>* House Bill 1900, which was passed last spring during the only\nstate legislative session to be held since Harvey, allots policyholders\nadditional time to determine final repair costs and permits them to work\nwith the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3503725459\">Texas Windstorm Insurance Association</org> if its estimates\naren't enough to cover the repair, said <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2710234423\">Texas Department of\nInsurance</org> press secretary <person>Jerry Hagins</person>. Also under the new rule, he\nsaid, TWIA policyholders have more time to request an appraisal to\nresolve payment disputes.</p>\n\n<p>* Hagins said also during last year's legislative session,\nseveral laws were passed that now require homeowners insurers to\nindicate in their policies if flood is not a covered peril, and allow\nsurplus lines companies to write flood insurance without requiring two\nrejections in the regular market.</p>\n\n<p>While industry experts laud those measures, some point to the need\nfor additional overhauls in the disaster-prone state, including a\nstatewide building code and uniform minimum construction standards.</p>\n\n<p>A recent review of coastal <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> building codes by the <org>Insurance\nInstitute for Business &amp; Home Safety</org> revealed gaps that could leave\none-third of homeowners living in coastal counties at risk if mitigation\nefforts and modern building codes aren't developed.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location>, unlike <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, lacks a statewide building code, leaving the\nadoption and enforcement of those standards up to city and county\nofficials.</p>\n\n<p>While 21 cities surveyed in the IBHS study have adopted a code,\nonly 20% of counties have adopted a standard, leaving more than 840,000\nresidents in areas outside city limits with no adopted residential\nbuilding code, according to Cope.</p>\n\n<p>She said that is driving the need for more investment in mitigation\n\"to bridge the gap and help vulnerable coastal communities build\nstronger.\"</p>\n\n<p>State insurance regulators hope new construction standards set to\ngo into effect later this year will help to close that gap for coastal\nhomeowners.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2710234423\">Texas Department of Insurance</org> announced it\nwas moving to newer standards that will provide greater windstorm\nprotection to homes and buildings built along the <location>Gulf Coast</location>. The\nstandards, designated for new structures or property repairs by owners\nseeking insurance coverage from the TWIA, were set to begin on <chron>April 1</chron>.\nBut because of business disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, TDI\nhas decided to push back the start date to <chron>Sept. 1</chron>.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location></p>\n\n<p>In 2017 and 2018, wildfires razed northern areas of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location>.</p>\n\n<p>The Tubbs Fire ravaged more than 36,000 acres of land, destroyed\nmore than 5,600 structures and claimed 22 lives in 2017, according to\nthe <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0809632502\">California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection</org>. The\nfire's destructiveness was surpassed the following year when the\n<location>Camp Fire</location> became the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state\nhistory and was the single costliest global natural disaster for\ninsurers in 2018.</p>\n\n<p><person>Thomas Holzheu</person>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"Swiss:SREN\">Swiss Re's</org> chief economist for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/am\">Americas</location>,\npoints to warmer temperatures and housing growth in wildfire urban\ninterfaces as fueling the rise in those and other recent wildfires.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2017, fires across the state have set off a domino effect\nthat includes some insurers pulling out of the market, a reduction in\ncapacity, and a rise in homeowners insurance prices and policy\nnonrenewals.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, nonrenewals in eight counties, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sierra\">Sierra</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ca.sandgo\">San\nDiego</location>, climbed by 10%, according to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0699924711\">California Department of\nInsurance</org>.</p>\n\n<p>But out of the ruin of the fires have come some big changes\ndesigned to aid homeowners living in fire-prone areas:</p>\n\n<p>* In <chron>December 2019</chron>, California Insurance Commissioner <person>Ricardo Lara</person>\nissued a mandatory, year-long moratorium, set to expire on <chron>Dec. 5</chron>, that\nprohibits insurers from issuing nonrenewal notices to nearly one million\npolicyholders living inside or next to the perimeter of a state-declared\nwildfire disaster. Lara issued the moratorium amid growing evidence that\nhomeowners insurance has become more difficult for Californians to\nobtain from traditional markets, forcing them into more expensive, less\ncomprehensive options such as the California Fair Access to Insurance\nRequirements Plan, the state's insurer of last resort.</p>\n\n<p>* The FAIR Plan has also recently undergone some changes, including\nan order by Lara last year calling for the plan to offer a comprehensive\nHO-3 policy in addition to its current fire-only policy; expand\nresidential coverage limits from <money>$1.5 million</money> to <money>$3 million</money>; and offer\nconsumers a monthly payment plan and the ability to pay by credit card\nor electronic funds transfer, all without fees.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> wildfires continue to rack up large losses for insurers,\nincluding more than <money>$12 billion</money> from the <chron>November 2018</chron> fires, according\nto the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0699924711\">California Department of Insurance</org>.</p>\n\n<p>State homeowners insurers, in turn, have been implementing\nre-underwriting measures, filing rounds of rate hike requests and\nexiting fire-prone areas \"where not restricted by recent\nlegislative changes,\" according to an <chron>April 6</chron> Best Market Segment\nReport.</p>\n\n<p>The authors of the report said many insurers are also continuing to\nreevaluate their wildfire underwriting strategies and enhance their\nreinsurance programs to limit exposure concentrations.</p>\n\n<p>While improvements have been made to bolster the resilience of\nthose structures, Cope, of IBHS, said even more needs to be done to the\nstate's building codes to protect homes in fire-prone areas.</p>\n\n<p>\"Unlike <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location> with its strict adoption and enforcement of a\nuniform building code, and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.tx\">Texas</location> that has yet to adopt a statewide\nmandate, I believe <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> lies in the middle with its history of\ngood building codes for wind and earthquake perils and the challenge of\nthe increasing severity and limited code provisions for wildfire,\"\nshe said.</p>\n\n<p>State legislators are hoping to change that. Last October,\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</location> passed several bills that encourage communities to adopt\nstandards for making homes and their surroundings more fire resistant.</p>\n\n<p>One of the new rules encourages home hardening efforts through a\n<org>California Wildfire Mitigation Financial Assistance Program</org> for\ncommunities in forest and brush areas across the state, while another\ncreates statewide defensible space requirements to reduce wildfire risks\nin communities.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. <person>Gavin Newsom</person> also signed into law last year legislation that\ncreates a single rule to be used in determining the value of property\ndamage for total and partial losses in insurance policies. Prior to the\nnew rule, state homeowners were paid the actual cash value of their home\nin the event of a total loss. Now insurance payouts for a total or\npartial loss are based on the cost to repair, rebuild or replace a\nproperty, minus a \"fair and reasonable\" deduction for physical\ndepreciation based on its condition at the time of an event.</p>\n\n<p>by Lori Chordas</p>\n\n<p>Lori Chordas is a senior associate editor.
