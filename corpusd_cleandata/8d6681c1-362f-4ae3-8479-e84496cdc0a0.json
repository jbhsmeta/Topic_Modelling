    "text": "By Patrick Garcia\n\nA video of an elderly man and a bike shop owner Wednesday (June 3) is touching\nthe hearts of many as it proved that despite the threat of COVID-19, there are\nstill people willing to help others in this time of crisis.\n\nAccording to Juhdel Pagador, staff of Carandang Bike Shop in Pasay City and\nthe uploader of the video, the elderly man, Carlos Samonte, had been visiting\nthe shop everyday for almost a week asking if there were any bikes available\nto purchase.\n\nWhen the shop finally had an available stock of mini mountain bikes, Samonte\nasked if he could buy one for P2,000 as that was the only money he had. The\namount was less than half its original price of P4,500.\n\nBut after he'd been back to the shop several times to look at the bike. the\nshop's owner, Fe Carandang, agreed to give the bike to Samonte for free and\neven gave him a bike lock to prevent it from being stolen saying, \"Kunin mo na\niyan. Regalo namin sa iyo.\" (Take it. It's our gift to you.)\n\nCarandang said Samonte walks from Nichols to Makati everyday to sell candies.\n\nWith the ongoing general community quarantine (GCQ) due to the COVID-19\npandemic, some public transportation has been suspended to regulate the\nmovement of people and to maintain social distancing.\n\nBecause of this, commuters often walk or bike for kilometers just to reach\ntheir workplaces.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\n(Screengrabbed from Juhdel Pagador's video)",

    "html": "<p>By <person>Patrick Garcia</person></p>\n\n<p>A video of an elderly man and a bike shop owner Wednesday (<chron>June 3</chron>)\nis touching the hearts of many as it proved that despite the threat of\nCOVID-19, there are still people willing to help others in this time of\ncrisis.</p>\n\n<p>According to Juhdel Pagador, staff of Carandang Bike Shop in Pasay\nCity and the uploader of the video, the elderly man, <person>Carlos Samonte</person>, had\nbeen visiting the shop everyday for almost a week asking if there were\nany bikes available to purchase.</p>\n\n<p>When the shop finally had an available stock of mini mountain\nbikes, Samonte asked if he could buy one for P2,000 as that was the only\nmoney he had. The amount was less than half its original price of\nP4,500.</p>\n\n<p>But after he'd been back to the shop several times to look at\nthe bike. the shop's owner, <person>Fe Carandang</person>, agreed to give the bike\nto Samonte for free and even gave him a bike lock to prevent it from\nbeing stolen saying, \"Kunin mo na iyan. Regalo namin sa iyo.\"\n(Take it. It's our gift to you.)</p>\n\n<p>Carandang said Samonte walks from Nichols to Makati everyday to\nsell candies.</p>\n\n<p>With the ongoing general community quarantine (GCQ) due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, some public transportation has been suspended to\nregulate the movement of people and to maintain social distancing.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, commuters often walk or bike for kilometers just\nto reach their workplaces.</p>\n\n<p>CAPTION(S):</p>\n\n<p>(Screengrabbed from Juhdel Pagador's video)</p>",
