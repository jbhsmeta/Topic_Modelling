    "text": "South Koreans Rally In Support Of Black Lives MatterGetty ImagesThe COVID-19\npandemic and the global protests agains racism triggered by George Floyd's\ndeath reflect a period of worldwide turmoil. People around the globe are\nanxious and angry and call for change. Adding the steeply increasing awareness\nof the climate crisis over the past year to this (remember Greta Thunberg)\nsuggests that something is going on--a transition perhaps.Particularly, these\ndevelopments question the viability of the capitalist system that has emerged\nover the past two centuries. Rather than seeking only for economic prosperity\nand value deals, people seem to increasingly seek for purpose, fairness and\nresponsibility. Along those lines, companies, governments and leaders aren't\nmerely judged anymore based on their economic merits, but also and especially\non their moral stance and behavior.Of course, people have never completely\nforgotten about this and moral, purpose, fairness and responsibility have\nalways played a role in the capitalist system. But it seems the balance is\nshifting. And this may bring us back to the kind of capitalist system that\nAdam Smith originally anticipated.Adam Smith's 18th Century IdeasMost Popular\nIn:Adam Smith (1723-1790) was an 18th-century Scottish moral philosopher and\npolitical economist. He is well known for his bookThe Wealth of NationsWhat\nfar less people know, is that Smith wrote another major book,The Theory of\nMoral SentimentsSmith believed that, when people would develop sufficient\nsympathy, they would realize that it is in their own self-interest to keep in\nmind the interests of others. Without sufficient sympathy, capitalism could\nnot work properly, he implied.Of course this is a grave simplification of\nSmith's view on capitalism. But it shows how his original version of\ncapitalism is a more constrained version than the free market capitalism we\nhave come to know. And it is not constrained in a top-down manner by\ngovernments and laws but by our own individual capacity for sympathy.Fast\nforward to 2020In a very short period between early 2019 and today, major\ndevelopments are taking place that all in one way or the other refer back to\nSmith's idea of sympathy as condition for effective capitalism. Whether it is\nthe increase in awareness of climate change, the disruptive coronavirus that\nforces people to rethink what they do and why, or the recent protests that\nshow how deeply embedded racism still is in society, all these developments\nreflect a call for more sympathy. A call for looking further than one's own\nshort-term economic self-interest. For taking care of each other and our\nplanet.One can be skeptical and argue that people are just paying lip service\nor want to be heard whatever the cause. Or that they are bored sitting at home\nand tired of social distancing and see protest as a way of entertainment. Or\none could argue this is just a temporary glitch after which we return to the\n\"old normal\" instead of transitioning to a \"new normal.\" After all, we also\nbelieved things would change after the financial crisis in 2008 and that\ndidn't really happen either.But one can also be optimistic. Climate change is\ngetting really visible, COVID-19 is the biggest disrupter of the economy since\nWorld War II and the protests against racism spread acrossall continents",

    "title": "Capitalism 1.0: How Crisis And Protest Can Help Revive Adam Smith\u2019s Original Capitalism [Forbes]",
    "html": "<p>South Koreans Rally In Support Of Black Lives MatterGetty ImagesThe COVID-19 pandemic and the global protests agains racism triggered by George Floyd&#8217;s death reflect a period of worldwide turmoil. People around the globe are anxious and angry and call for change. Adding the steeply increasing awareness of the climate crisis over the past year to this (remember <person>Greta Thunberg</person>) suggests that something is going on&#8212;a transition perhaps.Particularly, these developments question the viability of the capitalist system that has emerged over the past two centuries. Rather than seeking only for economic prosperity and value deals, people seem to increasingly seek for purpose, fairness and responsibility. Along those lines, companies, governments and leaders aren&#8217;t merely judged anymore based on their economic merits, but also and especially on their moral stance and behavior.Of course, people have never completely forgotten about this and moral, purpose, fairness and responsibility have always played a role in the capitalist system. But it seems the balance is shifting. And this may bring us back to the kind of capitalist system that Adam Smith originally anticipated.Adam Smith&#8217;s 18th Century IdeasMost Popular In:Adam Smith (1723-1790) was an 18th-century Scottish moral philosopher and political economist. He is well known for his bookThe Wealth of NationsWhat far less people know, is that Smith wrote another major book,The Theory of Moral SentimentsSmith believed that, when people would develop sufficient sympathy, they would realize that it is in their own self-interest to keep in mind the interests of others. Without sufficient sympathy, capitalism could not work properly, he implied.Of course this is a grave simplification of Smith&#8217;s view on capitalism. But it shows how his original version of capitalism is a more constrained version than the free market capitalism we have come to know. And it is not constrained in a top-down manner by governments and laws but by our own individual capacity for sympathy.Fast forward to 2020In a very short period between early 2019 and today, major developments are taking place that all in one way or the other refer back to Smith&#8217;s idea of sympathy as condition for effective capitalism. Whether it is the increase in awareness of climate change, the disruptive coronavirus that forces people to rethink what they do and why, or the recent protests that show how deeply embedded racism still is in society, all these developments reflect a call for more sympathy. A call for looking further than one&#8217;s own short-term economic self-interest. For taking care of each other and our planet.One can be skeptical and argue that people are just paying lip service or want to be heard whatever the cause. Or that they are bored sitting at home and tired of social distancing and see protest as a way of entertainment. Or one could argue this is just a temporary glitch after which we return to the &#8220;old normal&#8221; instead of transitioning to a &#8220;new normal.&#8221; After all, we also believed things would change after the financial crisis in 2008 and that didn&#8217;t really happen either.But one can also be optimistic. Climate change is getting really visible, COVID-19 is the biggest disrupter of the economy since World War II and the protests against racism spread acrossall continents</p>",
