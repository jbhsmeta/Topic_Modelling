    "text": "DENVER \\- After scraping by for weeks on unemployment checks and peanut butter\nsandwiches, Jake Lyon recently received the call that many who temporarily\nlost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic have anticipated: The\ncollege-town tea shop where he worked was reopening, and it was time to go\nback.\n\nBut Lyon, 23, and his co-workers in Fort Collins, Colo., who were temporarily\nlaid off, worried about contracting the virus, so they asked the shop's owners\nto delay reopening and meet with them to discuss safety measures. The\nreluctance cost them. Six of them permanently lost their jobs in May, and\ntheir former employer reported them to the state's unemployment office to have\ntheir benefits potentially revoked.\n\nAs people across the United States are told to return to work, employees who\nbalk at the health risks say they are being confronted with painful reprisals:\nSome are losing their jobs if they try to stay home, and thousands more are\nbeing reported to the state to have their unemployment benefits cut off.\n\nBusinesses want to bring back customers and profits. But workers now worry\nabout contracting the coronavirus once they return to cramped restaurant\nkitchens, dental offices or conference rooms where few colleagues are wearing\nmasks.\n\nLabor advocates and unions say the push to recall workers and kick reluctant\nemployees off unemployment benefits carries grave risks in the age of the\ncoronavirus, when infections have rampaged through meatpacking plants, call\ncenters, factories and other confined spaces where co-workers spend hours\ntouching the same surfaces and breathing the same air.\n\n_Jack Healy is a New York Times writer._",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">DENVER</location> - After scraping by for weeks on unemployment checks and peanut butter sandwiches, <person>Jake Lyon</person> recently received the call that many who temporarily lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic have anticipated: The college-town tea shop where he worked was reopening, and it was time to go back.</p>\n\n      <p>But Lyon, 23, and his co-workers in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.forins\">Fort Collins, Colo.</location>, who were temporarily laid off, worried about contracting the virus, so they asked the shop's owners to delay reopening and meet with them to discuss safety measures. The reluctance cost them. Six of them permanently lost their jobs in May, and their former employer reported them to the state's unemployment office to have their benefits potentially revoked.</p>\n\n      <p>As people across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> are told to return to work, employees who balk at the health risks say they are being confronted with painful reprisals: Some are losing their jobs if they try to stay home, and thousands more are being reported to the state to have their unemployment benefits cut off.</p>\n\n      <p>Businesses want to bring back customers and profits. But workers now worry about contracting the coronavirus once they return to cramped restaurant kitchens, dental offices or conference rooms where few colleagues are wearing masks.</p>\n\n      <p>Labor advocates and unions say the push to recall workers and kick reluctant employees off unemployment benefits carries grave risks in the age of the coronavirus, when infections have rampaged through meatpacking plants, call centers, factories and other confined spaces where co-workers spend hours touching the same surfaces and breathing the same air.</p>\n\n      <p><em><person>Jack Healy</person> is a <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:NYT\">New York Times</org> writer.</em></p>",
