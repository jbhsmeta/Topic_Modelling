    "text": "Real estate, which affects demand for home construction and home appliances,\nis still humming in Northeast Ohio, albeit with sales off by about 10% to 20%\ncompared to last year, agents say.\n\nWith department stores facing bankruptcy and hotels seeing huge occupancy\ndips, the real estate industry will accept moderate decline after Ohio\ndeclared real estate an essential business.\n\nReal estate agents throughout the region say the problem is a lack of willing\nsellers.\n\nThey're spooked by fears of prospective buyers, appraisers, inspectors and\ncontractors bringing coronavirus into their homes.\n\nLeeAnn Poth of Landes & Landes Real Estate in Wooster said some of her sellers\nhave pulled their houses off the market.\n\n\"Some are rentals, and they didn't want to risk their renters getting sick,\"\nshe said.\n\nAnother seller pulled a listing because they had an underlying health\ncondition.\n\nLow supply\n\nThe inventory of homes was already low before the pandemic, agents said, so\nmoderately priced homes are getting multiple offers within days of hitting the\nmarket.\n\n\"I'm getting calls every day from people wanting to buy. But what they want\nisn't out there,\" Poth said. \"I just had somebody call me today wanting to buy\na horse farm and none are available\" for less than $300,000.\n\n\"You don't have the luxury of looking at three, four homes,\" said Stephen\nBoyles, owner and Realtor for Century 21 Wilbur in Kent. \"If it's a decent\nvalue, there's going to be other people right there.\"\n\nInterest rates have dropped to about 3.5%, which Boyles called \"dirt cheap.\"\n\nSeniors are still going into nursing homes, estates are selling homes of the\ndeceased, couples are still getting divorced and people are still moving to\nswitch jobs.\n\nNew normal\n\nThe use of sanitizer, wipes, gloves and even footsies for in-person showings\nhave become standard protocol.\n\nLinda Wengerd, president of the Wayne-Homes Association of Realtors, said\nwhenever possible, agents are working virtually or utilizing technology.\nHomebuyers can tour homes virtually through video chat as their real estate\nagent walks through the house.\n\nThough open houses have been suspended during COVID-19, personal home tours\nare still available via an appointment, she said.\n\nReal estate agents have been wearing masks whenever they cannot work remotely\nand have continued practicing safe sanitizing habits, Wengerd said.\n\nWengerd is unsure when open houses will resume, she said. However, with more\nbusinesses and organizations finding ways to reopen, Wengerd hopes open houses\nwill be able to resume by mid-summer.\n\nDominic Fonte, a real estate agent for Cutler Realty based in North Canton,\nsaid agents who can't keep up with the trends won't be able to stay in the\nbusiness.\n\nBoyles expressed concern about how the pandemic could impact Kent's big\nemployer, Kent State University, which has instituted pay cuts in response to\nstate budget cuts and declining enrollment. That could affect the local real\nestate market.\n\n\"Even though there's been government subsidies, at some point if people can't\nmake their mortgage payments, that's going to have a very negative effect on\nthe market,\" he said, adding that a wave of foreclosures could flood the\nmarket with homes. \"So things could change in a few months.\"\n\nHe said if Ohio experiences a second wave of COVID-19 infections, then it'll\nbe less than the shock of March and \"we're going to be better prepared for\nit.\"\n\nFonte believes some who would have listed their home in March or April will do\nso later in the year with many tiring of the stay-at-home order restrictions.\n\nHe said while those who have lost jobs will opt out of planned purchases of\nhomes, he believes that his 2020 sales could be about the same as in 2019.\n\n\"I think it's going to pick up once people get used to the new normal,\" he\nsaid.\n\nAccording to numbers provided by the Wayne-Holmes Association, home sales are\ndown compared to last year for the month of April.\n\nThough fewer homes were sold, houses stayed on the market for a shorter amount\nof time.\n\n\"Our spring got a little bit of a slower start, but it's still a pretty strong\nmarket,\" Wengerd said. \"Buyers are still in need of homes.\"\n\nFonte does not see a repeat of 2008 and 2009, when many could not quickly sell\ntheir homes because they owed more their homes were worth.\n\nThe firm CoreLogic last fall said the number of \"underwater\" or negative\nequity homes nationwide is the lowest since 2010.\n\nPoth hopes she can return to doing more in-person showings. She believes they\nprovide prospective buyers more insight.\n\n\"At three to five years, I think we should be back to normal. This virus stuff\ncan't last forever, certainly.\"\n\nCREDIT: SAMANTHA ICKES; ROBERT WANG",

    "html": "<p>Real estate, which affects demand for home construction and home appliances, is still humming in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Northeast Ohio</location>, albeit with sales off by about 10% to 20% compared to last year, agents say. </p><p>With department stores facing bankruptcy and hotels seeing huge occupancy dips, the real estate industry will accept moderate decline after <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> declared real estate an essential business. </p><p>Real estate agents throughout the region say the problem is a lack of willing sellers. </p><p>They&#8217;re spooked by fears of prospective buyers, appraisers, inspectors and contractors bringing coronavirus into their homes. </p><p><person>LeeAnn Poth</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/fr.la\">Landes</location> &amp; <org>Landes Real Estate</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.wooter\">Wooster</location> said some of her sellers have pulled their houses off the market. </p><p>&#8220;Some are rentals, and they didn&#8217;t want to risk their renters getting sick,&#8221; she said. </p><p>Another seller pulled a listing because they had an underlying health condition. </p><p>Low supply </p><p>The inventory of homes was already low before the pandemic, agents said, so moderately priced homes are getting multiple offers within days of hitting the market. </p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting calls every day from people wanting to buy. But what they want isn&#8217;t out there,&#8221; Poth said. &#8220;I just had somebody call me today wanting to buy a horse farm and none are available&#8221; for less than <money>$300,000</money>. </p><p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have the luxury of looking at three, four homes,&#8221; said <person>Stephen Boyles</person>, owner and Realtor for <org>Century 21 Wilbur</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.kent\">Kent</location>. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a decent value, there&#8217;s going to be other people right there.&#8221; </p><p>Interest rates have dropped to about 3.5%, which Boyles called &#8220;dirt cheap.&#8221; </p><p>Seniors are still going into nursing homes, estates are selling homes of the deceased, couples are still getting divorced and people are still moving to switch jobs. </p><p>New normal </p><p>The use of sanitizer, wipes, gloves and even footsies for in-person showings have become standard protocol. </p><p><person>Linda Wengerd</person>, president of the <org>Wayne-Homes Association of Realtors</org>, said whenever possible, agents are working virtually or utilizing technology. Homebuyers can tour homes virtually through video chat as their real estate agent walks through the house. </p><p>Though open houses have been suspended during COVID-19, personal home tours are still available via an appointment, she said. </p><p>Real estate agents have been wearing masks whenever they cannot work remotely and have continued practicing safe sanitizing habits, Wengerd said. </p><p>Wengerd is unsure when open houses will resume, she said. However, with more businesses and organizations finding ways to reopen, Wengerd hopes open houses will be able to resume by mid-summer. </p><p><person>Dominic Fonte</person>, a real estate agent for <org>Cutler Realty</org> based in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.nonton\">North Canton</location>, said agents who can&#8217;t keep up with the trends won&#8217;t be able to stay in the business. </p><p>Boyles expressed concern about how the pandemic could impact Kent&#8217;s big employer, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1934888545\">Kent State University</org>, which has instituted pay cuts in response to state budget cuts and declining enrollment. That could affect the local real estate market. </p><p>&#8220;Even though there&#8217;s been government subsidies, at some point if people can&#8217;t make their mortgage payments, that&#8217;s going to have a very negative effect on the market,&#8221; he said, adding that a wave of foreclosures could flood the market with homes. &#8220;So things could change in a few months.&#8221; </p><p>He said if <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> experiences a second wave of COVID-19 infections, then it&#8217;ll be less than the shock of March and &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be better prepared for it.&#8221; </p><p>Fonte believes some who would have listed their home in March or April will do so later in the year with many tiring of the stay-at-home order restrictions. </p><p>He said while those who have lost jobs will opt out of planned purchases of homes, he believes that his 2020 sales could be about the same as in 2019. </p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to pick up once people get used to the new normal,&#8221; he said. </p><p>According to numbers provided by the <org>Wayne-Holmes Association</org>, home sales are down compared to last year for the month of April. </p><p>Though fewer homes were sold, houses stayed on the market for a shorter amount of time. </p><p>&#8220;Our spring got a little bit of a slower start, but it&#8217;s still a pretty strong market,&#8221; Wengerd said. &#8220;Buyers are still in need of homes.&#8221; </p><p>Fonte does not see a repeat of 2008 and 2009, when many could not quickly sell their homes because they owed more their homes were worth. </p><p>The firm <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:CLGX\">CoreLogic</org> last fall said the number of &#8220;underwater&#8221; or negative equity homes nationwide is the lowest since 2010. </p><p>Poth hopes she can return to doing more in-person showings. She believes they provide prospective buyers more insight. </p><p>&#8220;At three to five years, I think we should be back to normal. This virus stuff can&#8217;t last forever, certainly.&#8221; </p><p>CREDIT: <person>SAMANTHA ICKES</person>; <person>ROBERT WANG</person></p>",
