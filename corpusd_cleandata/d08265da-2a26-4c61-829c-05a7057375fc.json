    "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WAVY) - With the postponement of the 2020 Summer\nOlympics, athletes are facing new and different challenges.\n\nAs a two-time Paralympic athlete, Adam Ballou is used to tough situations, but\neven he was sidelined by the coronavirus.\n\nFor a Paralympic athlete with cerebral palsy, he faced an opponent unlike any\nother when he was diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\n\"I was laying down, hard to breathe. Sitting up, hard to breathe. Standing up,\nhard to breathe. I was like 'what can I do?'\" he said.\n\nBallou was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was six-months-old. He is a\nVirginia Beach native, and currently teaching English and playing club soccer\nin Spain.\n\nHe said the virus started with a fever.\n\n\"I started to cough and then my chest started to hurt, like there was\nsomething in my lungs, like there was a liquid,\" said Ballou. \"I would breathe\nin and I would wheeze.\"\n\nBallou played on Team USA's seven-per-side soccer team at both the London and\nRio Paralympic Games.\n\nThe intensity of the virus surprised him.\n\n\"I'm 27, like I'm healthy, I'm an athlete,\" Ballou said. \"I shouldn't have any\nproblems kicking this thing, but you never know, so I was super nervous.\"\n\nBallou says he's feeling better, just dealing with a little bit of soreness in\nhis lungs.\n\nSeven-per-side soccer was cut from the Tokyo Paralympic games, so Ballou is\nfocused on building up his strength again, and getting back on the soccer\nfield in Spain.\n\n\"That mental toughness and just being physically fit, as an athlete, helped me\nprepare for this,\" Ballou said.\n\n\\------------\n\nLatest Posts\n\n* Mississippi Braves and Trustmark Park are in the clear\n\n* Catching up with Alcorn State head coach Fred McNair\n\n* Organizers hold \"Peace in Da SiPP\" rally\n\n* Mario Clark's family fights for justice at Black Lives Matter protest\n\n* Black Lives Matter Mississippi holds protest in downtown Jackson",
