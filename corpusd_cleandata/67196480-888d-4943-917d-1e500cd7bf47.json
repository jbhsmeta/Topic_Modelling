    "text": "A NASA business jet descended into Kennedy Space Center airspace Wednesday,\nits touchdown signaling the kickoff of a packed schedule for its astronaut\npassengers.\n\nBob Behnken and Doug Hurley, both spaceflight veterans, landed at KSC's former\nshuttle runway just before 4 p.m., eventually greeted by NASA Administrator\nJim Bridenstine and KSC Director Bob Cabana. The flight was organized in such\na way to keep them safely distanced from others during the coronavirus\npandemic.\n\nBut unlike the Gulfstream III that flew them from Houston to the Space Coast,\ntheir next ride looks like something out of science fiction: SpaceX's Crew\nDragon capsule, which will host humans for the first time when it launches\nfrom pad 39A on May 27. The mission to the International Space Station, known\nas Demo-2, is targeting 4:33 p.m. for liftoff.\n\nRelated: SpaceX's next launch will officially have astronauts on board\n\n\"Both Doug and I are really excited to be here,\" Behnken, an Air Force colonel\nand former shuttle astronaut, said after landing. \"As graduates of military\ntest pilot schools, if you gave us one thing we could have put on our list of\ndream jobs we could have had some day, it would have been to be aboard a new\nspacecraft.\"\n\nThe mission to launch astronauts from U.S. soil is nearly a decade in the\nmaking. The capability disappeared with the space shuttle program's last\nflight in July 2011, forcing NASA to buy seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft\nuntil its investments in commercial companies came through. First up to the\nplate is SpaceX, but Boeing and its Starliner capsule were also selected as\npart of the program.\n\n\"It's just an amazing vehicle, but it's definitely not the space shuttle in\nmany ways. It's much smaller, but it's a capsule. It's state-of-the-art from a\ntechnology standpoint,\" Hurley, a retired Marine Corps colonel who flew on the\nlast space shuttle mission, said of Crew Dragon. \"We are so excited to be in a\nreal spaceship and not the simulator here in just a week.\"\n\nUntil launch next week, the duo will continue their training and rehearsals.\nThey'll conduct fit tests with SpaceX's spacesuits; ride out to the pad in\nTesla Model X SUVs just like on launch day; and spend time in the Crew Dragon\ncapsule now at pad 39A. All the while, they'll follow stringent quarantine\nprocedures and regularly get tested for COVID-19 before their flight to the\nISS.\n\nSometime this week, their families - also observing strict quarantine - will\narrive to join them. They'll likely spend time in the famous \"Astronaut Beach\nHouse,\" a spot where astronauts from Gemini to Apollo to space shuttle would\ngather to socialize and work.\n\nRelated: Who's flying in the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Meet astronauts Bob Behnken\nand Doug Hurley\n\n\"Maybe we'll get a chance to go and visit that facility and maybe start a\ntradition or two out there with our families as a part of the new era that\nwe're embarking on,\" Behnken said.\n\nOn Thursday, the critical flight readiness review will take place - if all is\n\"go,\" that gives teams permission to proceed with operations until the launch\nreadiness review, which is tentatively slated for Monday.\n\nThis weekend, the Space Force is expected to release a weather forecast for\nthe instantaneous launch window, meaning that Falcon 9 has to launch at\nexactly 4:33 p.m. or push to the backup date of May 30.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at\n[aekelly@floridatoday.com](mailto:aekelly@floridatoday.com) or 321-242-3715.\nFollow him on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at @EmreKelly.\n\nThis story originally published to\n[floridatoday.com](http://floridatoday.com), and was shared to other Florida\nnewspapers in the USA TODAY Network - Florida.",

    "html": "<p>A <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> business jet descended into <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.kenter\">Kennedy Space Center</location> airspace Wednesday, its touchdown signaling the kickoff of a packed schedule for its astronaut passengers.</p>\n<p><person>Bob Behnken</person> and <person>Doug Hurley</person>, both spaceflight veterans, landed at KSC's former shuttle runway just before <chron>4 p.m.</chron>, eventually greeted by <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> Administrator <person>Jim Bridenstine</person> and KSC Director <person value=\"APIN:0565774277\">Bob Cabana</person>. The flight was organized in such a way to keep them safely distanced from others during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike the Gulfstream III that flew them from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.houstn\">Houston</location> to the <location>Space Coast</location>, their next ride looks like something out of science fiction: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>'s <person>Crew Dragon</person> capsule, which will host humans for the first time when it launches from pad 39A on <chron>May 27</chron>. The mission to the <location>International Space Station</location>, known as Demo-2, is targeting <chron>4:33 p.m.</chron> for liftoff.</p>\n\n<p>Related: <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>'s next launch will officially have astronauts on board</p>\n\n<p>\"Both Doug and I are really excited to be here,\" Behnken, an <org>Air Force</org> colonel and former shuttle astronaut, said after landing. \"As graduates of military test pilot schools, if you gave us one thing we could have put on our list of dream jobs we could have had some day, it would have been to be aboard a new spacecraft.\"</p>\n\n<p>The mission to launch astronauts from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> soil is nearly a decade in the making. The capability disappeared with the space shuttle program's last flight in <chron>July 2011</chron>, forcing <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> to buy seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft until its investments in commercial companies came through. First up to the plate is <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>, but <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing</org> and its Starliner capsule were also selected as part of the program.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's just an amazing vehicle, but it's definitely not the space shuttle in many ways. It's much smaller, but it's a capsule. It's state-of-the-art from a technology standpoint,\" Hurley, a retired <org>Marine Corps</org> colonel who flew on the last space shuttle mission, said of <person>Crew Dragon</person>. \"We are so excited to be in a real spaceship and not the simulator here in just a week.\"</p>\n\n<p>Until launch next week, the duo will continue their training and rehearsals. They'll conduct fit tests with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>'s spacesuits; ride out to the pad in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:TSLA\">Tesla</org> Model X SUVs just like on launch day; and spend time in the Crew Dragon capsule now at pad 39A. All the while, they'll follow stringent quarantine procedures and regularly get tested for COVID-19 before their flight to the ISS.</p>\n\n<p>Sometime this week, their families &#8211; also observing strict quarantine &#8211; will arrive to join them. They'll likely spend time in the famous \"Astronaut <person>Beach House</person>,\" a spot where astronauts from Gemini to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.apollo\">Apollo</location> to space shuttle would gather to socialize and work.</p>\n\n<p>Related: Who's flying in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> Crew Dragon? Meet astronauts <person>Bob Behnken</person> and <person>Doug Hurley</person></p>\n\n<p>\"Maybe we'll get a chance to go and visit that facility and maybe start a tradition or two out there with our families as a part of the new era that we're embarking on,\" Behnken said.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, the critical flight readiness review will take place &#8211; if all is \"go,\" that gives teams permission to proceed with operations until the launch readiness review, which is tentatively slated for Monday.</p>\n\n<p>This weekend, the Space Force is expected to release a weather forecast for the instantaneous launch window, meaning that Falcon 9 has to launch at exactly <chron>4:33 p.m.</chron> or push to the backup date of <chron>May 30</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>Contact <person>Emre Kelly</person> at <a href=\"mailto:aekelly@floridatoday.com\">aekelly@floridatoday.com</a> or 321-242-3715.
