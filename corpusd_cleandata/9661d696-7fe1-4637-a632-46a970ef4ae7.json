Grampian, which has more than 200,000 more residents than Ayrshire has\none of the lowest death rates (4.1) in Scotland.\n\nDeaths by Ayrshire Council area\n\nSouth Ayrshire has recorded the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths\nin Ayrshire.\n\nUp to May 31, 105 people have died in the area with 101 deaths in North\nAyrshire and 70 in East.\n\nCoronavirus deaths by setting\n\nA total of 44 per cent of COVID-19 deaths in Ayrshire took place in care\nhomes.\n\nThis is slightly below the national picture, which is currently at 46 per\ncent.\n\nHospital deaths in Ayrshire accounted for the majority of coronavirus deaths\n(49 per cent).\n\nMeanwhile, home or non-institutional deaths accounted for seven per cent of\nthe region's virus deaths.\n\nBreaking this down further into local authorities, more South Ayrshire\nresidents have died in hospital (49 per cent) compared to care homes (47 per\ncent).\n\nThe majority of North Ayrshire deaths took place in hospital (47 per cent)\nwhile 44 per cent took place in care homes.\n\nIn East Ayrshire, hospital deaths accounted for 51 per cent of COVID-19\nfatalities, while 41 per cent of deaths occurred in care homes.\n\nCoronavirus cases\n\nCases are still increasing across Ayrshire but the amount of cases being\nconfirmed has been reduced dramatically.\n\nWe're only a handful of days into June but May saw Ayrshire record almost half\nthe number of COVID-19 reported in April.\n\nApril saw 585 confirmed cases reported, while May saw a total of 298 cases.\n\nHospital numbers\n\nThere has been a huge shift in the number of hospital patients with\ncoronavirus too since the Scottish Government started releasing the\ninformation on Wednesday, April 8.\n\nThe number of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 was at its highest\non Monday, April 20 when 129 people were in hospital.\n\nRecently, hospital numbers were at the lowest they've ever been (8) \u0096 a 93 per\ncent reduction since the peak.",
