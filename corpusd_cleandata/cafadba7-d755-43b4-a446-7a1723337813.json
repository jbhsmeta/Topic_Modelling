    "text": "GAINESVILLE, Texas \u0096 A man was arrested after he allegedly stole cattle and\nsold them at stockyards in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nThe investigation began when 12 head of Longhorn crossbred cattle with a\nfamiliar brand entered the ring at the Decatur Livestock Market and a buyer\ntook notice.\n\nThe buyer knew something didn't add up, so he called the owner who said he did\nnot consign the cattle.\n\nThat's when the owner contacted Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers\nAssociation Special Ranger Troy McKinney, who launched an investigation.\n\nInvestigators determined there was only one suspect: John Gilbert \"Jacky\"\nDavis, from Gainesville, who had been leasing land to and caring for some of\nthe victim's cattle.\n\nThe owner knew Davis had fallen on hard times, but said he never thought he'd\nresort to theft.\n\nThroughout the course of the investigation, McKinney, along with Cooke County\nSheriff's Office Livestock Deputy Matt Pease, discovered Davis had stolen and\nsold more of the victim's cattle, including 25 head at the Overbrook\nStockyards in Overbrook, Oklahoma.\n\nAnd it didn't stop once Davis had been questioned, investigators say.\n\nAt one point, he delivered 125 head of cattle to the Gainesville Livestock\nAuction, ordering them to be sold in the victim's name. McKinney was able to\nstop the sale, but the victim still had to pay charges for the cattle's care\nuntil he was able to pick them up.\n\nDavis turned himself in to the Cooke County Sheriff's Department last week. He\nis currently out on a $10,000 bond.",

McKinney was able to stop the sale, but the victim still had to pay charges for the cattle's care until he was able to pick them up.</p>\n\n<p>Davis turned himself in to the <org>Cooke County Sheriff's Department</org> last week. He is currently out on a <money>$10,000</money> bond.</p>",
