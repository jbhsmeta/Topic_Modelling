    "text": "Black swan disruption requires the right response to survive, thrive\n\nThis article is a summary of two IISE Chapter 1 Performance Excellence\nwebinars held in April. Regardless of your business situation in the context\nof COVID-19, we provide some ways to think through how to develop rapid,\nappropriate/effective responses that are scalable and sustainable.\n\nOur storyline is as follows:\n\n\"We are faced with an unprecedented disruption, a true black swan event that\nis obvious to all at this point.\n\n\"None of us can alter that fact; we are where we are and it is what it is.\nThere are many things we can t control, but we can manage our mindsets and our\nstrategies and actions to adjust and respond, to survive and ultimately\nthrive.\n\n\"There are at least four distinct scenarios or situations that organizations\nface. Each requires different strategies and tactics for success.\n\n\"The general strategy for success has not changed; however, the requirements\nfor creating strategies and executing them have changed dramatically.\n\n\"We'll end with some tips, learnings, lessons and suggestions that are\npragmatic and doable if you meet the critical requirements for success during\ncritical periods of this crisis.\n\nA black swan event of epic proportion\n\nA black swan is a rare, sporadic event seemingly unpredictable or unforeseen\nthat took us by surprise and carries massive transformational impact. These\nare also characterized as events that, in hindsight, were obvious.\n\nThere have been many disruptions over the past 50 years, none this ubiquitous\nand severe. These disruptions are caused by many different fac tors and root\ncauses and the approach to resolution has passed through a number of eras, so\nto speak: the era when technology has been a root cause (think Apollo 13); the\nera when human errors were the root cause (Challenger disaster); and the era\nwhen sociotechnical interactions were the root causes (mortgage crisis). Now\nwe enter an era when a disease is the root cause, but the resolution will\nenter us into an era of resilience engineering. Clearly this is and will\nchallenge all engineers, and ISEs will be right in the thick of things helping\nto navigate through and out of the storm.\n\nAccording to writer Haruki Murakami, And once the storm is over, you won t\nremember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won t even\nbe sure whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain: When you\ncome out of the storm, you won t be the same person who walked in. That s what\nthis storm is all about.\n\nLeading through disruptions requires mindset management work\n\nThese disruptions require a tremendous amount of focus, energy, patience,\nresolve and intentionality. It seems almost trite to remind you that attitude\nis a choice, yet because thoughts, words and deeds can be subject to\nunconsciousness, it bears reinforcement.\n\nHuman beings are remarkably resilient by nature. We see incredible innovation\nin the face of significant disruption. People will get at cause and be\nproactive and accountable in times of crisis, and we see that. In some\nrespects, mindset management work is easier in times of crisis than in a\nnormal period.\n\nHaving said that, it is still worth noting that leadership needs to ensure\npeople live (thought, word, deed) on the right side of Figure 1. Leaders\nensure this and create the conditions for this to naturally occur by rapidly\ncreating new strategy and policy, a clear new vision definition of done. They\ncreate a clear migration strategy and plan. They create explicit visible\nmeasurement and management systems.\n\nSpecifically, principles and methods of tiered huddles, huddle boards, war\nrooms, scenario planning, the use of the OKR system (objectives with\nassociated key results) weekly and sometimes daily, etc., all are approaches\nand methods that are useful in less disruptive times but become super critical\nin times of major disruptions.\n\nDoom to Tomb, Boom to Hibernate, Doom to Boom, Boom to Boom\n\nIn our recent IISE Chapter 1 webinars (see accompanying article on Page 41),\nwe introduced four situations and conditions that organizations are in as we\nenter and navigate through the storm. The point we are making is that your\nstrategy forward is perhaps intuitively shaped by the condition your\norganization was in before COVID-19. Performing an intellectually honest\nassessment of your capabilities in 10 areas is critical to formulating the\nright strategy.\n\n1\\. Financial stability\n\n2\\. Customer value exchange optimization\n\n3\\. Planning\n\n4\\. Execution\n\n5\\. Unique value proposition(s)\n\n6\\. Energy (hedgehog concept)\n\n7\\. Innovation\n\n8\\. Leadership\n\n9\\. Teamwork\n\n10\\. Culture\n\nThese are not surprising categories for assessment, and, of course, they re\nnot new. The answers you come up with in terms of how you fared against these\nbefore COVID-19 will have a major impact on the right strategy forward. Added\nin the webinar Business Continuity Strategies and Tactics in Periods of Major\nDisruption was that there are also the haves and the have-nots. This has to do\nwith the value propositions for organizations as evaluated in the context of\nthe storm. Organizations that can move things or switch from moving people to\nmoving things are well-positioned; people who can t do so aren t.\nOrganizations that by defi nition require people being together are not well-\npositioned to add value during the storm, which is intuitively obvious.\n\nThe key point in the transition from what category are you in - Boom to Boom,\nBoom to Hibernate, Doom to Boom or Doom to Tomb - is that in a global,\nubiquitous, pervasive and extended disruption, the only strategy for success\nis to reinvent. If you are a have, with strong positioning and value\nproposition in the storm yet weak, you can go Doom to Boom; if you are strong\nand strong, Boom to Boom. If you are a have-not and weak, it s Doom to Tomb;\nfigure out how to do that as well as you can and start over. If you are a\nhave-not and strong, Boom to Hibernate (such as theme parks). The webinar\nlists what organizations have to do depending on the situation they are in and\nspecific things to consider.\n\nIt s all about strategy, process, technology and people\n\nAs we said in the webinar Navigating Your Business Through the COVID Crisis,\nsome things are the same, some are different. Salvation is in your ability to\ncontinue successfully integrating strategy (actually rethinking and re-\nengineering your process for creating, enhancing and reinventing strategy);\ntechnology (disruptive innovation); process (changing what we do and how we do\nwhat we do); and people (alignment, attunement, focus, intentionality, etc.).\nIf we say keep focusing on strategy, technology, process and people, it s a\nglittering generality. As they say, the devil is in the details (people leave\noff the last part) and so is salvation. Each of these four system components\nhas to be either re-engineered in order to reinvent. It s Doom and Tomb if you\ncan t do this.\n\nHere are a couple of practical examples.\n\n\"Stick to the basics, what we know works. First who, then what. Get your best\nthinkers, forget the org chart, take the ranks off your shoulders and form,\nstorm and norm.\n\n\"Get a dedicated war room (virtual and physical) and go back to paper and\npencil, as W. Edwards Deming told us to do: Put up butcher block paper, buy\nlots of Post-Its and start to create a grand strategy. Plan across multiple\nfronts over multiple horizons. Get assumptions explicit and do an\nimportance/certainty analysis (a 2x2 matrix). Study up on creation\nskillfulness (Robert Fritz and Peter Senge) and create your shared vision(s)\nfor back side of the storm and beyond. The webinars provide many lists of\nthings to consider and do.\n\nStrategic guidance and tips\n\nLeading an organization (or sub-organization), regardless of size, through\nthis storm will not be easy. It will take some courage, vision, clarity and\nconviction, and plain old hard work. Figure 2 highlights five words that can\nchange the results you achieve in your transformations.\n\nJohn Kotter wrote a seminal article in Harvard Business Review that focused on\nthe eight reasons that transformation efforts fail. One of the reasons is that\npeople undercommunicate by a factor of 10. Creating a shared understanding of\nthe situation (being intellectually honest) and the vision for other side of\nthe storm and the strategy/path forward is a pre-condition for alignment.\nPeople have to hear, internalize and understand - and believe in - the vision\nand strategy to be aligned.\n\nAlignment is about creating the required levels of coordination and synergy\nthat are required to rapidly translate the strategy into a reality. This sets\nthe stage for visible measurement and management systems, creating the link\nbetween the talk, the walk and the results, so to speak.\n\nVisibility for objectives and required results and how we are doing in\nrelationship to the walk and the outcomes, if done properly, then positions\nfor managed (self-managed and team managed) accountability. As we discussed\nearlier, the atcause mindset, by definition, is an aligned accountability.\n\nFinally, there is discipline. One of the major findings in Jim Collins work\narticulated in Built to Last and Good to Great was the role of discipline in\nthought, word and deed in highperforming organizations. In times of global\ndisruptions, organizations, again regardless of size, domain, etc., have to\nfind, discover, migrate to and take advantage of the nexus of their hedgehog\n(the intersection of positioning, competencies and passion/energy). Those in\nBoom to Boom and Doom to Boom have to keep the flywheel of innovation spinning\n- go, go, go! Boom to Hibernate companies have to refocus innovation on how to\nhibernate smart and then how to be ready to go, go, go on the back side and\nnot lose a day of opportunity. That s not a trivial planning and logistics\nexercise. Think of theme parks and entertainment venues as examples most of us\ncan understand.\n\nFor Doom to Tomb, the same thing applies, only innovate to die gracefully,\nwith respect, care for people and customers and suppliers and then ifyou have\nthe energy, figure out a new hedgehog and reinvent (see Figure 3).\n\nA list of things to consider and think about\n\nRegardless of your situation, there are some fundamental things that leaders\nand managers need to address. Here is a list for you to consider:\n\n\"Preserve the top line by focusing on building trust with key customers. Reach\nout to customers to best understand their evolving needs and communicate plans\nto mitigate risk and ensure continuity.\n\n\"Adapt current resources to meet business needs and prioritize based on\ncriticality of products and services.\n\n\"Monitor and respond to market and competitive dynamics. Leverage lessons\nlearned in the market and in past disruptions, track competitors reactions,\nand redefine and revisit budgets and planning.\n\n\"Prepare for bounce-back scenarios based on company performance and market\nperformance, including capacity planning, assessing potential acquisitions and\nevaluating marketing campaigns.\n\n\"Manage cash and liquidity - stress test cash flow scenarios, ensure prudent\ncash management processes and assess investment viability.\n\n\"Instill rigorous cost discipline and strict procurement processes, evaluate\nemployee base and limit discretionary spending.\n\n\"Revise financial plans and perform scenario stress tests. Revisit target\nplanning, be transparent on cash and financial positioning to key\nstakeholders. ???\n\nDavid Poirier, PE, is CEO of The Poirier Group in Toronto, Canada, and\npresident of IISE.

Cities with\ndense populations and with residents who rely on public transportation\nstruggled to handle the spread of COVID-19 as it overwhelmed medical\nfacilities.\n\nTo address the problem now and in years to come, experts weighed in at Smart\nCity Expo Atlanta\n([smartcityexpoatlanta.com](http://smartcityexpoatlanta.com)) on ideas for\neasing the impact of pandemics in the future. They agree the key elements in\nmodern life that have led to the pandemic are two of the most common human\npractices: Travel and trade.\n\n\"Pandemics are much more than a health problem, said Dr. William Karesh,\npandemic expert and executive vice president for health and policy at the\nEcoHealth Alliance. They re a societal issue. Human behavior is what drives\nthem.\n\nTo immunize cities against future pandemics requires finding a way to alter\nthose behaviors and how they are managed.\n\n\"They re changes that need to begin sooner than later, since the number of\nhuman emerging infectious diseases has been increasing over the last 50 years,\nKaresh said.\n\nOne idea is to use advanced technology to help detect and prevent the spread\nof future pathogens. A risk software provider called Blue Dot, which uses\nnatural language processing and machine learning to scan news reports and\nnetworks for diseases, was able to alert customers to the spread of\ncoronavirus days before the World Health Organization s announcement of its\nthreat.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need to implement systems that\nproactively manage infectious disease risks which, in our rapidly changing\nworld, are increasing in frequency, scale and impact, said Dr. Kamran Khan,\nfounder and CEO of BlueDot. And it is with enhanced preparedness that we can\nget ahead of these threats to create a healthier, safer and more prosperous\nworld. Every day you save in catching it, the less amplified this thing\nbecomes. A week is a huge amount of time in a city when millions of people are\nat risk.\n\nCities can use monitoring systems powered by algorithms that review data from\nelectronic medical records to measure hospital visit spikes and trends in\ncertain conditions or diagnoses. Karesh envisions such real-time measures can\nbe used to monitor air in mass transit stations for disease patterns that\nwould allow officials to move quickly to mitigate any threat.\n\nCommunication between cities can also slow the spread by sharing key\ninformation. A partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the National\nLeague of Cities created a joint venture March 23 to track how cities and\nlocal leadership responded to the crisis and identified best practices worth\nrepeating.\n\n\"As city leaders responses to the crisis evolve, we want to provide them with\ntools, data and resources needed to make informed decisions, said James\nAnderson, the head of Government Innovation at Bloomberg Philanthropies. This\ntool will allow local leaders to learn promising practices from their peers,\nshare ideas and work together during one of the most challenging times in this\nnation s history.\n\nCommunication networks can go beyond the leadership level, Karesh said, to\ninclude volunteers in the community as front-line observers to gather and\nshare information about the spread of a disease and preventive measures. That\nincludes businesses passing along information and policies about health\nconduct to keep sick individuals isolated from co-workers.\n\n\"Communities are powerful, he said. These pandemics are just like earthquakes\nand fires. People say you can t predict them, but you can actually predict\nthem really well.\n\nSource: SmartCity Expo Atlanta",

Regardless of your business situation in the context of COVID-19, we provide some ways to think through how to develop rapid, appropriate/effective responses that are scalable and sustainable.</p>\n<p>Our storyline is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"We are faced with an unprecedented disruption, a true black swan event that is obvious to all at this point.</p>\n<p>\"None of us can alter that fact; we are where we are and it is what it is. There are many things we can t control, but we can manage our mindsets and our strategies and actions to adjust and respond, to survive and ultimately thrive.</p>\n<p>\"There are at least four distinct scenarios or situations that organizations face. Each requires different strategies and tactics for success.</p>\n<p>\"The general strategy for success has not changed; however, the requirements for creating strategies and executing them have changed dramatically.</p>\n<p>\"We'll end with some tips, learnings, lessons and suggestions that are pragmatic and doable if you meet the critical requirements for success during critical periods of this crisis.</p>\n<p>A black swan event of epic proportion</p>\n<p>A black swan is a rare, sporadic event seemingly unpredictable or unforeseen that took us by surprise and carries massive transformational impact. These are also characterized as events that, in hindsight, were obvious.</p>\n<p>There have been many disruptions over the past 50 years, none this ubiquitous and severe. These disruptions are caused by many different fac tors and root causes and the approach to resolution has passed through a number of eras, so to speak: the era when technology has been a root cause (think Apollo 13); the era when human errors were the root cause (Challenger disaster); and the era when sociotechnical interactions were the root causes (mortgage crisis). Now we enter an era when a disease is the root cause, but the resolution will enter us into an era of resilience engineering. Clearly this is and will challenge all engineers, and ISEs will be right in the thick of things helping to navigate through and out of the storm.</p>\n<p>According to writer <person>Haruki Murakami</person>, And once the storm is over, you won t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won t even be sure whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain: When you come out of the storm, you won t be the same person <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> walked in. That s what this storm is all about.</p>\n<p>Leading through disruptions requires mindset management work</p>\n<p>These disruptions require a tremendous amount of focus, energy, patience, resolve and intentionality. It seems almost trite to remind you that attitude is a choice, yet because thoughts, words and deeds can be subject to unconsciousness, it bears reinforcement.</p>\n<p>Human beings are remarkably resilient by nature. We see incredible innovation in the face of significant disruption. People will get at cause and be proactive and accountable in times of crisis, and we see that. In some respects, mindset management work is easier in times of crisis than in a normal period.</p>\n<p>Having said that, it is still worth noting that leadership needs to ensure people live (thought, word, deed) on the right side of Figure 1. Leaders ensure this and create the conditions for this to naturally occur by rapidly creating new strategy and policy, a clear new vision definition of done. They create a clear migration strategy and plan. They create explicit visible measurement and management systems.</p>\n<p>Specifically, principles and methods of tiered huddles, huddle boards, war rooms, scenario planning, the use of the OKR system (objectives with associated key results) weekly and sometimes daily, etc., all are approaches and methods that are useful in less disruptive times but become super critical in times of major disruptions.</p>\n<p>Doom to Tomb, Boom to Hibernate, Doom to Boom, Boom to Boom</p>\n<p>In our recent <org>IISE Chapter</org> 1 webinars (see accompanying article on Page 41), we introduced four situations and conditions that organizations are in as we enter and navigate through the storm. The point we are making is that your strategy forward is perhaps intuitively shaped by the condition your organization was in before COVID-19. Performing an intellectually honest assessment of your capabilities in 10 areas is critical to formulating the right strategy.</p>\n<p>1. Financial stability</p>\n<p>2. Customer value exchange optimization</p>\n<p>3. Planning</p>\n<p>4. Execution</p>\n<p>5. Unique value proposition(s)</p>\n<p>6. Energy (hedgehog concept)</p>\n<p>7. Innovation</p>\n<p>8. Leadership</p>\n<p>9. Teamwork</p>\n<p>10. Culture</p>\n<p>These are not surprising categories for assessment, and, of course, they re not new. The answers you come up with in terms of how you fared against these before COVID-19 will have a major impact on the right strategy forward. Added in the webinar Business Continuity Strategies and Tactics in Periods of Major Disruption was that there are also the haves and the have-nots. This has to do with the value propositions for organizations as evaluated in the context of the storm. Organizations that can move things or switch from moving people to moving things are well-positioned; people <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> can t do so aren t. Organizations that by defi nition require people being together are not well-positioned to add value during the storm, which is intuitively obvious.</p>\n<p>The key point in the transition from what category are you in - Boom to Boom, Boom to Hibernate, Doom to Boom or Doom to Tomb - is that in a global, ubiquitous, pervasive and extended disruption, the only strategy for success is to reinvent. If you are a have, with strong positioning and value proposition in the storm yet weak, you can go Doom to Boom; if you are strong and strong, Boom to Boom. If you are a have-not and weak, it s Doom to Tomb; figure out how to do that as well as you can and start over. If you are a have-not and strong, Boom to Hibernate (such as theme parks). The webinar lists what organizations have to do depending on the situation they are in and specific things to consider.</p>\n<p>It s all about strategy, process, technology and people</p>\n<p>As we said in the webinar Navigating Your Business Through the COVID Crisis, some things are the same, some are different. Salvation is in your ability to continue successfully integrating strategy (actually rethinking and re-engineering your process for creating, enhancing and reinventing strategy); technology (disruptive innovation); process (changing what we do and how we do what we do); and people (alignment, attunement, focus, intentionality, etc.). If we say keep focusing on strategy, technology, process and people, it s a glittering generality. As they say, the devil is in the details (people leave off the last part) and so is salvation. Each of these four system components has to be either re-engineered in order to reinvent. It s Doom and Tomb if you can t do this.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of practical examples.</p>\n<p>\"Stick to the basics, what we know works. First <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org>, then what. Get your best thinkers, forget the org chart, take the ranks off your shoulders and form, storm and norm.</p>\n<p>\"Get a dedicated war room (virtual and physical) and go back to paper and pencil, as <person>W. Edwards Deming</person> told us to do: Put up butcher block paper, buy lots of Post-Its and start to create a grand strategy. Plan across multiple fronts over multiple horizons. Get assumptions explicit and do an importance/certainty analysis (a 2x2 matrix). Study up on creation skillfulness (<person>Robert Fritz</person> and <person>Peter Senge</person>) and create your shared vision(s) for back side of the storm and beyond. The webinars provide many lists of things to consider and do.</p>\n<p>Strategic guidance and tips</p>\n<p>Leading an organization (or sub-organization), regardless of size, through this storm will not be easy. It will take some courage, vision, clarity and conviction, and plain old hard work. Figure 2 highlights five words that can change the results you achieve in your transformations.</p>\n<p><person>John Kotter</person> wrote a seminal article in <org>Harvard Business Review</org> that focused on the eight reasons that transformation efforts fail. One of the reasons is that people undercommunicate by a factor of 10. Creating a shared understanding of the situation (being intellectually honest) and the vision for other side of the storm and the strategy/path forward is a pre-condition for alignment. People have to hear, internalize and understand - and believe in - the vision and strategy to be aligned.</p>\n<p>Alignment is about creating the required levels of coordination and synergy that are required to rapidly translate the strategy into a reality. This sets the stage for visible measurement and management systems, creating the link between the talk, the walk and the results, so to speak.</p>\n<p>Visibility for objectives and required results and how we are doing in relationship to the walk and the outcomes, if done properly, then positions for managed (self-managed and team managed) accountability. As we discussed earlier, the atcause mindset, by definition, is an aligned accountability.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is discipline. One of the major findings in <person>Jim Collins</person> work articulated in Built to Last and Good to Great was the role of discipline in thought, word and deed in highperforming organizations. In times of global disruptions, organizations, again regardless of size, domain, etc., have to find, discover, migrate to and take advantage of the nexus of their hedgehog (the intersection of positioning, competencies and passion/energy). Those in Boom to Boom and Doom to Boom have to keep the flywheel of innovation spinning - go, go, go! Boom to Hibernate companies have to refocus innovation on how to hibernate smart and then how to be ready to go, go, go on the back side and not lose a day of opportunity. That s not a trivial planning and logistics exercise. Think of theme parks and entertainment venues as examples most of us can understand.</p>\n<p>For Doom to Tomb, the same thing applies, only innovate to die gracefully, with respect, care for people and customers and suppliers and then ifyou have the energy, figure out a new hedgehog and reinvent (see Figure 3).</p>\n<p>A list of things to consider and think about</p>\n<p>Regardless of your situation, there are some fundamental things that leaders and managers need to address. Here is a list for you to consider:</p>\n<p>\"Preserve the top line by focusing on building trust with key customers. Reach out to customers to best understand their evolving needs and communicate plans to mitigate risk and ensure continuity.</p>\n<p>\"Adapt current resources to meet business needs and prioritize based on criticality of products and services.</p>\n<p>\"Monitor and respond to market and competitive dynamics. Leverage lessons learned in the market and in past disruptions, track competitors reactions, and redefine and revisit budgets and planning.</p>\n<p>\"Prepare for bounce-back scenarios based on company performance and market performance, including capacity planning, assessing potential acquisitions and evaluating marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>\"Manage cash and liquidity - stress test cash flow scenarios, ensure prudent cash management processes and assess investment viability.</p>\n<p>\"Instill rigorous cost discipline and strict procurement processes, evaluate employee base and limit discretionary spending.</p>\n<p>\"Revise financial plans and perform scenario stress tests. Revisit target planning, be transparent on cash and financial positioning to key stakeholders. ???</p>\n<p>David Poirier, PE, is CEO of <org>The Poirier Group</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.tornto\">Toronto, Canada</location>, and president of IISE.

Cities with dense populations and with residents <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">who</org> rely on public transportation struggled to handle the spread of COVID-19 as it overwhelmed medical facilities.</p>\n<p>To address the problem now and in years to come, experts weighed in at Smart City Expo Atlanta (<a href=\"http://smartcityexpoatlanta.com\">smartcityexpoatlanta.com</a>) on ideas for easing the impact of pandemics in the future. They agree the key elements in modern life that have led to the pandemic are two of the most common human practices: Travel and trade.</p>\n<p>\"Pandemics are much more than a health problem, said Dr. <person>William Karesh</person>, pandemic expert and executive vice president for health and policy at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0739029153\">EcoHealth Alliance</org>. They re a societal issue. Human behavior is what drives them.</p>\n<p>To immunize cities against future pandemics requires finding a way to alter those behaviors and how they are managed.</p>\n<p>\"They re changes that need to begin sooner than later, since the number of human emerging infectious diseases has been increasing over the last 50 years, Karesh said.</p>\n<p>One idea is to use advanced technology to help detect and prevent the spread of future pathogens. A risk software provider called Blue Dot, which uses natural language processing and machine learning to scan news reports and networks for diseases, was able to alert customers to the spread of coronavirus days before the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0757421235\">World Health Organization</org> s announcement of its threat.</p>\n<p>\"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need to implement systems that proactively manage infectious disease risks which, in our rapidly changing world, are increasing in frequency, scale and impact, said Dr. <person>Kamran Khan</person>, founder and CEO of BlueDot. And it is with enhanced preparedness that we can get ahead of these threats to create a healthier, safer and more prosperous world. Every day you save in catching it, the less amplified this thing becomes. A week is a huge amount of time in a city when millions of people are at risk.</p>\n<p>Cities can use monitoring systems powered by algorithms that review data from electronic medical records to measure hospital visit spikes and trends in certain conditions or diagnoses. Karesh envisions such real-time measures can be used to monitor air in mass transit stations for disease patterns that would allow officials to move quickly to mitigate any threat.</p>\n<p>Communication between cities can also slow the spread by sharing key information. A partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the <org>National League of Cities</org> created a joint venture <chron>March 23</chron> to track how cities and local leadership responded to the crisis and identified best practices worth repeating.</p>\n<p>\"As city leaders responses to the crisis evolve, we want to provide them with tools, data and resources needed to make informed decisions, said <person>James Anderson</person>, the head of Government Innovation at Bloomberg Philanthropies. This tool will allow local leaders to learn promising practices from their peers, share ideas and work together during one of the most challenging times in this nation s history.</p>\n<p>Communication networks can go beyond the leadership level, Karesh said, to include volunteers in the community as front-line observers to gather and share information about the spread of a disease and preventive measures. That includes businesses passing along information and policies about health conduct to keep sick individuals isolated from co-workers.</p>\n<p>\"Communities are powerful, he said. These pandemics are just like earthquakes and fires. People say you can t predict them, but you can actually predict them really well.</p>\n<p>Source: SmartCity Expo Atlanta</p>\n</div></object>",
