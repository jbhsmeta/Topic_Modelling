Meanwhile, a million other cops are doing their\nsworn duty to protect and serve.\n\nI used to think the race problem was about equality. That can't quite be true.\nWhat if whites or Asians took to the streets and demolished, burned buildings\nand looted stores every time a person of another race committed a heinous\ncrime, rather than taking to the courts, as befits a civil society? Why are\nnot these rioting criminals being rounded up and confined? One contemptible\ntreatment of a citizen by a bad cop does not in any way excuse the horrifying\ndestruction being allowed to happen in Minnesota and many other places.\n\nWithout the equal application of all laws, we don't have a civil society, but\na nation in chaos, which leads inevitably to tyranny, which the Head Table at\nProgressive HQ cannot wait to impose across the board.\n\nHarry Hagan\n\nPowder Springs",
