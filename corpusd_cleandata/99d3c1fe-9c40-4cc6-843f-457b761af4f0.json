    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at CDC & FDA\nDaily \\-- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our\njournalists obtained the following quote sourced from\n[medrxiv.org](http://medrxiv.org):\n\n\"Objective: We aim to provide early evidence of mental distress and its\nassociated predictors among adults in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in Brazil.\nMethods: We conducted a primary survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28,\n2020, about one month (32 days) after the first COVID-19 case in South America\nwas confirmed in Sao Paulo.\n\n\"Results: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or\nmoderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were\nfemale, younger, more educated, and exercised less report-ed higher levels of\ndistress.\n\n\"The distance from the Brazilian epicenter of Sao Paulo inter-acted with age\nand workplace attendance to predict the level of distress.\n\n\"The typhoon eye effect was stronger for people who were older or attended\ntheir workplace less.\n\n\"The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did\nnot go to their workplace in the week before the survey. Conclusion:\nIdentifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to\nbetter target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during\nthe ongoing COVID-19 crisis.\"\n\nThis preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>CDC &amp; FDA Daily</org> -- According to news reporting based on a preprint abstract, our journalists obtained the following quote sourced from <a href=\"http://medrxiv.org\">medrxiv.org</a>:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Objective: We aim to provide early evidence of mental distress and its associated predictors among adults in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>. Methods: We conducted a primary survey of 638 adults in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location> on <chron>March 25-28, 2020</chron>, about one month (32 days) after the first COVID-19 case in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/sam\">South America</location> was confirmed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/br..saopau\">Sao Paulo</location>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Results: In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less report-ed higher levels of distress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The distance from the Brazilian epicenter of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/br..saopau\">Sao Paulo</location> inter-acted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The typhoon eye effect was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. Conclusion: Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This preprint may not have been peer-reviewed.
