    "text": "As advocates for free speech, we can't help but see a certain irony in the\nattack President Donald Trump is mounting on social media organizations: Egged\non by some of his supporters, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Trump on\nThursday signed an executive order that he said is designed to curtail broad\nprotections granted to internet platform providers by Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act.\n\nIn fact, the president is taking aim at the First Amendment rights of private\ncompanies to engage in their own free speech. At a White House signing\nceremony, Trump claimed that he and other conservatives have been victims of\n\"censorship\" by social media providers. This from a supernova of the\nTwittersphere who by the latest count has published 50,000 times under the\nhandle @realDonaldTrump.\n\nWhat prompted Trump to strike out at what he calls \"censorship\" by social\nmedia companies was a decision by Twitter to fact check one of his tweets and\nlabel it \"misleading.\"\n\nIn doing so, Twitter did not muzzle the president but instead exercised its\neditorial discretion. That's protected by the First Amendment.\n\nTrump's executive order takes aim at the protections Congress gave internet\nproviders in 1996, when the internet was in its relative infancy. To put it in\nperspective: Mark Zuckerberg was 12 and it would be another eight years before\nhe launched Facebook from his Harvard dorm room.\n\nSection 230 gives internet platforms a legal immunity that traditional\npublishers don't enjoy by decreeing that internet service providers and\nbloggers cannot be held responsible for comments posted by users of their\nsites. Lawmakers believed internet platforms opened public discourse to a\nmultitude of voices and feared they would be strangled in their cribs if they\nwere forced to defend against a lawsuit every time they failed to remove an\nintemperate post. Although Congress hoped social media platforms would use\ntheir immunity to remove harmful content, the law Congress wrote did not\nrequire it.\n\nDIGITAL WEEDS\n\nAlong with the thousand flowers -- times many, many more -- that have bloomed\non the internet, so have many noxious weeds. Social media have become a vector\nfor viruses almost as dangerous as the one that causes COVID-19:\nDisinformation can be a democracy-killer, the more so when it's spread by\nworld leaders whose jobs make them role models.\n\nThe president's penchant for inaccuracies has been well-catalogued by others\nbut recently, he has used Twitter to revive a whopper that had even some of\nhis conservative allies shaking their heads in dismay, reviving a long-\ndiscredited tale that links former U.S. Representative-turned-MSNBC host Joe\nScarborough to the accidental death of a young woman who worked in his\ncongressional office.\n\nUnder intense pressure over the defamatory Scarborough tweet and with the\nstaffer's widower begging Twitter to remove it, Twitter took action -- but not\non that issue. Instead, Twitter fact-checked a tweet in which the president\nclaimed that California's mail-in ballot procedure would open the door to\nwidespread election fraud. The fact-check label, which provided readers with a\nlink to additional information so they could make their own decisions about\nthe truth, led the president to sign the executive order targeting Twitter --\nand, potentially, other social media platforms -- for exercising editorial\njudgment.\n\nThe irony is that the libel umbrella Trump wants to snatch away is the only\nreason that Twitter would leave a false and defamatory tweet like the\nScarborough allegation untouched; without section 230, Twitter would be\ntreated like a traditional publisher, such as a newspaper, and would risk\nliability if it didn't take the president's tweet down.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA NEWS SOURCE\n\nWith the death of so many local papers and radio stations, readers --\nparticularly in rural areas -- rely more and more on social media for news,\nbut social media make it hard to distinguish reliable news sources from\npajama-clad amateurs. Combine that with information overload and the many and\ndevious sources of disinformation and it's no wonder democracy is in danger of\noverdosing on cynicism.\n\nHaving supplanted traditional publishers as citizens' primary source of\ninformation, social media platforms are right to begin acting like mature\ncorporate citizens. The only problem is that they seem to take two steps\nbackward for every one in advance.\n\nConsider Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to distance his company from\nthe controversy over Twitter's fact-checking: \"I just believe strongly that\nFacebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say\nonline.\" But shouldn't the most powerful media company in the world -- and\nthat's what Facebook is -- devote some resources to prevent its platform from\nbeing used to infect public discourse with viral lies?\n\nA responsible corporation may not be able to ascertain the Platonic ideal of\ntruth. But it should be able to distinguish an outright falsehood, like the\ndoctored video of Nancy Pelosi that Facebook refused to take down.\n\nThe First Amendment is designed to protect political speech, especially speech\nthat criticizes and questions those in power. It is not designed as a shield\nfor malicious falsehoods. Our law punishes defamatory falsehoods to ensure\nthat public discourse maintains an anchor in truth, for without it, public\ndiscourse becomes meaningless.\n\nIf the president really wants to get rid of section 230's protections of\ninternet providers, it means the same defamation laws that keep traditional\npublishers from turning their pages over to the loudest and most outrageous\nvoices will apply to internet platforms as well. The person most likely to be\nsilenced: Trump himself.\n\nKathy Kiely is the Lee Hills Chair in Free Press Studies at the Missouri\nSchool of Journalism; Lyrissa Lidsky is dean of the University of Missouri\nSchool of Law.",

    "html": "<p>As advocates for free speech, we can't help but see a certain irony in the attack President <person>Donald Trump</person> is mounting on social media organizations: Egged on by some of his supporters, including <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mo\">Missouri</location> Sen. <person>Josh Hawley</person>, Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that he said is designed to curtail broad protections granted to internet platform providers by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p>\n<p>In fact, the president is taking aim at the First Amendment rights of private companies to engage in their own free speech. At a <org>White House</org> signing ceremony, Trump claimed that he and other conservatives have been victims of \"censorship\" by social media providers. This from a supernova of the Twittersphere who by the latest count has published 50,000 times under the handle @realDonaldTrump.</p>\n\n<p>What prompted Trump to strike out at what he calls \"censorship\" by social media companies was a decision by Twitter to fact check one of his tweets and label it \"misleading.\"</p>\n\n<p>In doing so, Twitter did not muzzle the president but instead exercised its editorial discretion. That's protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>Trump's executive order takes aim at the protections <org>Congress</org> gave internet providers in 1996, when the internet was in its relative infancy. To put it in perspective: <person value=\"APIN:0653102364\">Mark Zuckerberg</person> was 12 and it would be another eight years before he launched <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org> from his Harvard dorm room.</p>\n\n<p>Section 230 gives internet platforms a legal immunity that traditional publishers don't enjoy by decreeing that internet service providers and bloggers cannot be held responsible for comments posted by users of their sites. Lawmakers believed internet platforms opened public discourse to a multitude of voices and feared they would be strangled in their cribs if they were forced to defend against a lawsuit every time they failed to remove an intemperate post. Although <org>Congress</org> hoped social media platforms would use their immunity to remove harmful content, the law <org>Congress</org> wrote did not require it.</p>\n\n<p>DIGITAL WEEDS</p>\n\n<p>Along with the thousand flowers &#8212; times many, many more &#8212; that have bloomed on the internet, so have many noxious weeds. Social media have become a vector for viruses almost as dangerous as the one that causes COVID-19: Disinformation can be a democracy-killer, the more so when it's spread by world leaders whose jobs make them role models.</p>\n\n<p>The president's penchant for inaccuracies has been well-catalogued by others but recently, he has used Twitter to revive a whopper that had even some of his conservative allies shaking their heads in dismay, reviving a long-discredited tale that links former <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Representative-turned-<org>MSNBC</org> host <person>Joe Scarborough</person> to the accidental death of a young woman who worked in his congressional office.</p>\n\n<p>Under intense pressure over the defamatory Scarborough tweet and with the staffer's widower begging Twitter to remove it, Twitter took action &#8212; but not on that issue. Instead, Twitter fact-checked a tweet in which the president claimed that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California's</location> mail-in ballot procedure would open the door to widespread election fraud. The fact-check label, which provided readers with a link to additional information so they could make their own decisions about the truth, led the president to sign the executive order targeting Twitter &#8212; and, potentially, other social media platforms &#8212; for exercising editorial judgment.</p>\n\n<p>The irony is that the libel umbrella Trump wants to snatch away is the only reason that Twitter would leave a false and defamatory tweet like the Scarborough allegation untouched; without section 230, Twitter would be treated like a traditional publisher, such as a newspaper, and would risk liability if it didn't take the president's tweet down.</p>\n\n<p>SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS SOURCE</p>\n\n<p>With the death of so many local papers and radio stations, readers &#8212; particularly in rural areas &#8212; rely more and more on social media for news, but social media make it hard to distinguish reliable news sources from pajama-clad amateurs. Combine that with information overload and the many and devious sources of disinformation and it's no wonder democracy is in danger of overdosing on cynicism.</p>\n\n<p>Having supplanted traditional publishers as citizens' primary source of information, social media platforms are right to begin acting like mature corporate citizens. The only problem is that they seem to take two steps backward for every one in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Consider <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org> CEO <person value=\"APIN:0653102364\">Mark Zuckerberg's</person> attempt to distance his company from the controversy over Twitter's fact-checking: \"I just believe strongly that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org> shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" But shouldn't the most powerful media company in the world &#8212; and that's what <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org> is &#8212; devote some resources to prevent its platform from being used to infect public discourse with viral lies?</p>\n\n<p>A responsible corporation may not be able to ascertain the Platonic ideal of truth. But it should be able to distinguish an outright falsehood, like the doctored video of <person>Nancy Pelosi</person> that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NASDAQ-NMS:FB\">Facebook</org> refused to take down.</p>\n\n<p>The First Amendment is designed to protect political speech, especially speech that criticizes and questions those in power. It is not designed as a shield for malicious falsehoods. Our law punishes defamatory falsehoods to ensure that public discourse maintains an anchor in truth, for without it, public discourse becomes meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>If the president really wants to get rid of section 230's protections of internet providers, it means the same defamation laws that keep traditional publishers from turning their pages over to the loudest and most outrageous voices will apply to internet platforms as well. The person most likely to be silenced: Trump himself.</p>\n\n<p><person>Kathy Kiely</person> is the Lee Hills Chair in Free Press Studies at the <org>Missouri School of Journalism</org>; <person>Lyrissa Lidsky</person> is dean of the <org>University of Missouri School of Law</org>.</p>",
