    "text": "Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard has charged six Atlanta police\nofficers for using excessive force in the arrest of two college students\nduring protests. \"The conduct involved in this incident is not indicative of\nthe way we treat people in the city of Atlanta, Howard said in a news\nconference.\n\nA viral video on social media and body camera footage showed officers use\nTaser stun guns on two students, Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim, while they\nsat in their car. The officers then forcefully dragged them out of the car and\narrested them.\n\nThe students said they are relieved that charges have been brought against the\nofficers.\n\nIm happy they are finally being held accountable,\" Pilgrim said. \"All I can\nsay is I hope every police officer who thinks its OK to drag someone, beat\nsomeone because theyre cops I hope they are held accountable as well.\n\nI feel a little safer now, now that these monsters are off of the street and\nno longer to terrorize anyone else from this point on, Young said.\n\nA $10,000 signature bond has been set, and the officers have until Friday to\nturn themselves in. Here are the charges announced by Howard.\n\nTHE OFFICERS INVOLVED:\n\nIvory Streeter: Aggravated assault on Pilgrim (used taser); pointing or aiming\ngun on Young\n\nMark Gardner: Aggravated assault on Pilgrim (used taser)\n\nLonnie Hood: Aggravated assault on Young (used taser); aggravated assault and\nsimple battery on Pilgrim (used taser)\n\nWillie Sauls: Aggravated assault on Pilgrim (pointed taser); criminal damage\nto property (car)\n\nArmond Jones: Aggravated battery of Young (forcefully thrown unto paved\nstreet); pointing or aiming a gun at Young\n\nRoland Claud: Criminal damage to property (car)\n\nThe police union is calling foul on the quick response by Howard.\n\nWeve had cases that have gone on two to four years that DA Paul Howard hasnt\nbeen able to make a decision on, and had officers sitting on the desk for two\nto four years. Yet he could do this really quick in three days? I think theres\na little more motivation here than trying to serve justice or to do the right\nthing, said Vince Champion, with the International Brotherhood of Police\nOfficers.\n\nThe union plans on fighting the charges. A union representative told that\nHoward and his office never spoke with the officers to get their side of the\nstory. The students say they got caught up in protests after grabbing a bite\nto eat. Just hours earlier, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had announced a\n9 p.m. curfew.\n\nIn the video, you can see the officers yank the students out of their car.\nWhen the students refused, they were shocked with stun guns and thrown to the\nground. Officers broke a car window and slashed a tire. Pilgrim was handcuffed\nand put in a police vehicle.",

The officers then forcefully dragged them out of the car and arrested them.</p>\n<p>The students said they are relieved that charges have been brought against the officers.</p>\n<p>Im happy they are finally being held accountable,\" Pilgrim said. \"All I can say is I hope every police officer who thinks its OK to drag someone, beat someone because theyre cops I hope they are held accountable as well.</p>\n<p>I feel a little safer now, now that these monsters are off of the street and no longer to terrorize anyone else from this point on, Young said.</p>\n<p>A <money>$10,000</money> signature bond has been set, and the officers have until Friday to turn themselves in. Here are the charges announced by Howard.</p>\n<p>THE OFFICERS INVOLVED:</p>\n<p><person>Ivory Streeter</person>: Aggravated assault on Pilgrim (used taser); pointing or aiming gun on Young</p>\n<p><person>Mark Gardner</person>: Aggravated assault on Pilgrim (used taser)</p>\n<p><person>Lonnie Hood</person>: Aggravated assault on Young (used taser); aggravated assault and simple battery on Pilgrim (used taser)</p>\n<p><person>Willie Sauls</person>: Aggravated assault on Pilgrim (pointed taser); criminal damage to property (car)</p>\n<p><person>Armond Jones</person>: Aggravated battery of Young (forcefully thrown unto paved street); pointing or aiming a gun at Young</p>\n<p><person>Roland Claud</person>: Criminal damage to property (car)</p>\n<p>The police union is calling foul on the quick response by Howard.</p>\n<p>Weve had cases that have gone on two to four years that DA Paul Howard hasnt been able to make a decision on, and had officers sitting on the desk for two to four years. Yet he could do this really quick in three days? I think theres a little more motivation here than trying to serve justice or to do the right thing, said <person>Vince Champion</person>, with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0846083466\">International Brotherhood of Police Officers</org>.</p>\n<p>The union plans on fighting the charges. A union representative told that Howard and his office never spoke with the officers to get their side of the story. The students say they got caught up in protests after grabbing a bite to eat. Just hours earlier, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">Atlanta</location> Mayor <person>Keisha Lance Bottoms</person> had announced a <chron>9 p.m.</chron> curfew.</p>\n<p>In the video, you can see the officers yank the students out of their car. When the students refused, they were shocked with stun guns and thrown to the ground. Officers broke a car window and slashed a tire. Pilgrim was handcuffed and put in a police vehicle.</p>",
