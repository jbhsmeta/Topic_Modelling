He also said\nhis father had tested positive for the coronavirus, but had been asymptomatic.\n\nDye, 80, is second among all ECU coaches with a .724 winning percentage\n(48-18-1) in six seasons. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of\nFame in 2005.\n\nHis overall coaching record was 153-62-5 in 17 years at Auburn, Wyoming and\nECU.\n\nWhen Dye came to Auburn, he inherited a program that was deeply divided after\nonly three winning seasons in the previous six years. In 12 years, he posted a\n99-39-4 record, coached star running back Bo Jackson, Auburn won or shared\nfour Southeastern Conference championships and the Tigers were ranked in The\nAssociated Press' Top 10 five times.\n\nHis coaching career ended in November 1992 when he was forced to resign after\na pay-for-play scandal rocked the program, which was placed on two years'\nprobation.\n\nDye served as athletic director as well as coach for most of his career with\nAuburn. He remained associated with the university after his resignation and\nwas a frequent commentator on football talk-radio shows.\n\nDye's career began as an assistant at Alabama under Bear Bryant in the 1960s.\n\nFrye's award\n\nEast Carolina football offensive lineman Fernando Frye on Monday was announced\nas a scholar-athlete award winner from the National Football Foundation's Bill\nDooley Chapter.\n\nFrye, who will compete as a graduate student for the Pirates this year, is a\ntwo-year starter at guard who transferred in prior to the 2017 campaign. He\nalso is an honor roll and dean's list performer with a cumulative grade point\naverage of 3.72. The Erie, Pa., native, who played in all 12 Pirate games a\nseason ago, graduated from ECU in December of 2019 with a bachelor's degree in\ncriminal justice.\n\nOther winners from the Bill Dooley chapter included Trenton Gill (N.C.
