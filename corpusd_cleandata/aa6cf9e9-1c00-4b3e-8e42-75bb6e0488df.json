    "text": "GREAT FALLS, Mt., June 3 \\-- The U.S. Department of Justice's U.S. Attorney's\noffice for District of Montana issued the following press release:\n\nAn East Glacier Park man convicted after a drunken driving crash killed one\npassenger and seriously injured a second passenger in Glacier National Park\nlast year was sentenced today to 18 months in prison and three years of\nsupervised release, U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme said.\n\nAfter a three-day trial in February, a jury found Leo James Hagan, 20, guilty\nof involuntary manslaughter and of assault resulting in serious bodily injury.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Brian M. Morris presided.\n\nThe prosecution presented evidence at trial that the crash occurred on June\n11, 2019, on Two Medicine Road, about 200 yards inside of Glacier National\nPark. Hagan and the two victims had been socializing at the Trailhead Saloon\nin East Glacier that night, and Hagan had consumed alcohol. The group left the\nsaloon and traveled toward Two Medicine Lake, with Hagan driving a Ford\nEscape.\n\nHagan lost control of the vehicle, failed to negotiate a sharp left turn, went\noff the road and hit a tree. The vehicle spun and rolled and came to a rest on\nthe driver's side. The front seat passenger was ejected and suffered severe\ninjuries. The rear seat passenger also was ejected, pinned under the vehicle\nand died at the scene.\n\nHagan left the scene on foot and called 911. He implied he had come upon the\nscene of a crash and was otherwise not involved. He reported seeing one\ninjured person but not his involvement, the cause or that a passenger had\ndied.\n\nA Blackfeet Law Enforcement Services officer ultimately found Hagan at his\nresidence at about 2:30 a.m. Hagan confirmed he had been in the crash and had\nbeen driving. A blood draw during the investigation determined that Hagan had\na blood alcohol concentration of .093 percent more than four hours after the\ncrash.\n\nA crash investigation determined that the vehicle was traveling more than 70\nmph in a 45 mph speed zone when it crashed, that the driver never applied the\nbrakes and that neither Hagan nor the front seat passenger was wearing a\nseatbelt. Hagan had claimed he was wearing a seatbelt and had braked.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Kalah Paisley and Ethan Plaut prosecuted the case,\nwhich was investigated by the National Park Service, Blackfeet Law Enforcement\nand Medical Services, the Glacier County Sheriff's Office and the Montana\nHighway Patrol.

Morris</person> presided.</p>\n<p>The prosecution presented evidence at trial that the crash occurred on <chron>June 11, 2019</chron>, on <location>Two Medicine Road</location>, about 200 yards inside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mt.glaark\">Glacier National Park</location>. Hagan and the two victims had been socializing at the <org>Trailhead Saloon</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mt.glaier\">East Glacier</location> that night, and Hagan had consumed alcohol. The group left the saloon and traveled toward <location>Two Medicine Lake</location>, with Hagan driving a Ford Escape.</p>\n<p>Hagan lost control of the vehicle, failed to negotiate a sharp left turn, went off the road and hit a tree. The vehicle spun and rolled and came to a rest on the driver's side. The front seat passenger was ejected and suffered severe injuries. The rear seat passenger also was ejected, pinned under the vehicle and died at the scene.</p>\n<p>Hagan left the scene on foot and called 911. He implied he had come upon the scene of a crash and was otherwise not involved. He reported seeing one injured person but not his involvement, the cause or that a passenger had died.</p>\n<p>A Blackfeet Law Enforcement Services officer ultimately found Hagan at his residence at about <chron>2:30 a.m.</chron> Hagan confirmed he had been in the crash and had been driving.
