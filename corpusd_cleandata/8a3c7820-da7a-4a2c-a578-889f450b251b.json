    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily India\nReport -- Data detailed on Respiratory Tract Diseases and Conditions - Airway\nObstruction have been presented. According to news reporting originating in\nSrinagar, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"It is believed that\ncarrying out laryngectomy in tracheotomized patients leads to higher\npostoperative complications and stomal recurrence compared to carrying out the\nprocedure upfront without prior tracheotomy. We believe that emergency\nlaryngectomy is a feasible procedure in most cancer centers and can be carried\nout for indications beyond acute airway obstruction as well and complex\nreconstruction procedures can be also carried out simultaneously.\"\n\nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Sher i Kashmir\nInstitute of Medical Sciences, \"We hereby describe our experience with\nemergency laryngectomy with or without pharyngectomy. Retrospective analysis\nof prospectively maintained data base was carried out. Patients who had\nundergone emergency laryngectomy in our department, from 2014 to 2018, were\nanalyzed, and their clinicodemographic and histopathological features were\nnoted. The indications for surgery and postoperative complications were\ncharted down. Survival data of patients were also noted. Seven patients have\nundergone emergency laryngectomy, 5 for acute airway obstruction and 2 for\nacute bleeding. Five patients were chemoradiotherapy failures, whereas 2\npatients were operated upfront. Two out of 7 patients had pyriform fossa\ncarcinoma, whereas rest of the patients had carcinoma of glottis.\nReconstruction with pectoralis myocutaneous/pectoralis muscle only flap was\ncarried out in 4 patients. Minor salivary leak was noted in 4 patients at\nvarying time intervals from second week onward. Two patients had post\nradiotherapy chondroradionecrosis, without any residual/recurrent tumor. Three\nout of 7 patients developed recurrence which was salvageable in only 1\npatient.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Emergency\nlaryngectomy can be safely carried out in emergency setting in most cancer\ncenters, more so over it can be carried out for indications beyond acute\nairway obstruction and combined with complex reconstruction procedures.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Emergency Laryngectomy Feasibility\nand Indications Beyond Airway Obstruction in the Era of Concurrent\nChemoradiotherapy. _Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal_, 2020;():014556132092794.\n\nOur news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting Z.A.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at Daily India Report -- Data detailed on Respiratory Tract Diseases and Conditions - Airway Obstruction have been presented. According to news reporting originating in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/in..srigar\">Srinagar, India</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;It is believed that carrying out laryngectomy in tracheotomized patients leads to higher postoperative complications and stomal recurrence compared to carrying out the procedure upfront without prior tracheotomy. We believe that emergency laryngectomy is a feasible procedure in most cancer centers and can be carried out for indications beyond acute airway obstruction as well and complex reconstruction procedures can be also carried out simultaneously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Sher i <org>Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences</org>, &#8220;We hereby describe our experience with emergency laryngectomy with or without pharyngectomy. Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained data base was carried out. Patients who had undergone emergency laryngectomy in our department, from 2014 to 2018, were analyzed, and their clinicodemographic and histopathological features were noted. The indications for surgery and postoperative complications were charted down. Survival data of patients were also noted. Seven patients have undergone emergency laryngectomy, 5 for acute airway obstruction and 2 for acute bleeding. Five patients were chemoradiotherapy failures, whereas 2 patients were operated upfront. Two out of 7 patients had pyriform fossa carcinoma, whereas rest of the patients had carcinoma of glottis. Reconstruction with pectoralis myocutaneous/pectoralis muscle only flap was carried out in 4 patients. Minor salivary leak was noted in 4 patients at varying time intervals from second week onward. Two patients had post radiotherapy chondroradionecrosis, without any residual/recurrent tumor. Three out of 7 patients developed recurrence which was salvageable in only 1 patient.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;Emergency laryngectomy can be safely carried out in emergency setting in most cancer centers, more so over it can be carried out for indications beyond acute airway obstruction and combined with complex reconstruction procedures.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Emergency Laryngectomy Feasibility and Indications Beyond Airway Obstruction in the Era of Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy. <em>Ear, Nose, &amp; <org>Throat Journal</org></em>, 2020;():014556132092794.</p>\n<p>Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>Z.A.
