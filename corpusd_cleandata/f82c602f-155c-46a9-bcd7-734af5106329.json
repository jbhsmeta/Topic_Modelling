    "text": "Here are the latest developments in the global coronavirus pandemic:\n\n\u2022 The official number of deaths from Covid-19 in the UK on Friday was 40,261,\nwhich is 357 higher than Thursday.\n\n\u2022 The 'R' number crept up on Friday, currently averaging between 0.7 and 0.9\nas of data available on June 5.\n\n\u2022 New data estimates the 'R' number for the North-East and North Yorkshire\ncurrently stands at 0.89, previously the highest in the UK.\n\n\u2022 The new highest region in the UK is the North-West which has an estimated\n'R' number of 1.01 - the rate where, on average every person who is infected\nwill infect 1 other person.\n\n\u2022 The North-East still has UK's highest coronavirus death rate with Public\nHealth England figures showing the region has seen an average of 78 deaths per\n100,000 people.\n\n\u2022 Data recorded between January 30, 2020 and June 3, 2020, shows a total of\n2,082 Covid-19 related deaths have been recorded in our region.\n\n\u2022 Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged people not to take part in mass\ndemonstrations over the weekend in breach of lockdown rules. Protests are\nexpected to take place across the country, including in Durham, in response to\nthe death of George Floyd in America.\n\n\u2022 Mr Hancock also told the daily briefing the Government was upgrading the\nguidance to ensure that \"even as the virus comes under control\" hospitals can\nbe a place of \"care and of safety\". Visitors and outpatients will need to wear\nface coverings and all hospital staff will be required to wear surgical masks\nin England from June 15.\n\n\u2022 Professor Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health\nOrganisation, said the evidence that wearing masks prevented transmission of\ncoronavirus was \"not very strong\" but stated that he would choose to wear one\nwhen using public transport.\n\n\u2022 Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he decided not to ask all Transport for\nLondon (TFL) users to wear face coverings before it became Government policy\nto ensure \"message clarity\". The new rules come into force on June 15, but Mr\nKhan said he had been lobbying the Government to implement the face covering\nrule for the last two months.\n\n\u2022 Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said wearing a face covering is not as\nimportant as washing your hands or social distancing for preventing the spread\nof Covid-19. Mr Shapps compared the new face coverings rule on public\ntransport to the alcohol ban introduced on Transport for London a decade ago.\n\n\u2022 Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the coronavirus pandemic could\ngive fresh impetus to creating more green jobs.\n\n\u2022 Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways' parent company IAG, told\nSky News that the incoming quarantine rule \"has in effect torpedoed our\nopportunity to get flying in July\".\n\n\u2022 A total of 2,409 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for\ncoronavirus, up by 14 from 2,395 on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon said. Speaking\nat the Scottish Government's coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, the First\nMinister said 15,582 people have tested positive for the virus across\nScotland, up by 29 from 15,553 previous day.\n\n\u2022 Downing Street has said the NHS Covid-19 symptoms tracking app, which had\nbeen due to be rolled out in mid-May, would be made available to the public in\nthe \"coming weeks\". Downing Street confirmed police would have to abide by the\nrequirements of the test and trace system. It comes after reports forces are\nintending to carry out their own track and trace processes if officers tested\npositive for coronavirus.\n\n\u2022 A total of 220,057 tests for coronavirus were carried out in the 24 hours up\nto 9am on Friday, Downing Street confirmed. Out of those, 96,474 were\nconducted via home testing kits while 40,385 were antibody tests.\n\n\u2022 The available capacity for testing was 220,213.\n\n\u2022 A total of 194,467 antibody tests have been carried out on NHS staff so far,\nalthough Downing Street said it was still to determine the most \"appropriate\nmeans\" for supplying more information about the results.",
