    "text": "Bangkok (dpa) - Cambodian authorities should urgently investigate the\nabduction in broad daylight of a Thai pro-democracy activist in the capital\nPhnom Penh, Human Rights Watch said on Friday.\n\nThe New York-based rights group said Wanchalearm Satsaksit was abducted at\naround 6 pm on Thursday by a group of armed men who took him away in a black\ncar as he walked to buy food in front of his apartment, according to witnesses\nand apartment security cameras.\n\nThai police spokesman Colonel Krissana Pattanacharoen said Thai authorities do\nnot have information on the abduction as it took place outside the country.\n\nSouth-East Asian countries have been repeatedly accused of turning a blind eye\nto the apprehension of exiled activists and even sending them back home under\nno legal framework.\n\nKrissana said Thai police have not coordinated with Cambodian authorities.\n\nWanchalerm is affiliated with Thailand's pro-democracy \"red shirt\" movement\nwhich opposes the country's traditional establishment and the military's\ndominance in politics.\n\nHe fled to Cambodia after Thailand's military seized power in a coup in May\n2014 and continued to be politically active on social media.\n\nThai police issued an arrest warrant for Wanchalerm in June 2018 for running\nthe Facebook page which roughly translates \"I will surely get 100 million baht\nfrom Thaksin,\" a satirical reference to former prime minister Thaksin\nShinawatra.\n\nThaksin, a billionaire telecommunications tycoon, was ousted as prime minister\nin a 2006 military coup and is often accused by his political enemies of\nbuying support.\n\n# Notebook\n\n## Internet links \\- [Human Rights Watch statement](<http://dpaq.de/IkvaQ>)",
