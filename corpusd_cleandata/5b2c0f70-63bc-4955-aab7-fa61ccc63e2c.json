    "text": "NEW DELHI, June 5 \\-- lockdown has affected all sectors in India. While some\nsectors like hospitality, aviation, restaurants, shopping malls and micro-\nfinance have been affected severely, the real estate sector showcase more\ndiverse trends. It is a testimony to VTP Realty's brand value and ability to\nproactively an execute strategy changes while maintaining a customer-centric\napproach in such a difficult period. VTP Realty achieves peak performance by\nselling 300 units while working remotely since the start of the lockdown.\n\nThe biggest impact on the real estate sector has felt by the lack of site\nvisits, and a wait-and-watch mindset among buyers that has created inventory\npileups and issues with sustained cash flow. However, VTP Realty is ahead of\nthe curve again.\n\nVTP has gained excellent brand value over the years because they deliver\nproperties that offer excellent build quality and design. their 3-pillar\nphilosophy of better design, better build and better care along with customers\ntrust helps them make the impossible possible again and again. VTP properties\noffer maximum livable area with best-in-segment amenities that very few\ndevelopers in Pune offer.\n\nMr. Sachin Bhandari, CEO, VTP Realty, explains, \"Yes, the lockdown has\naffected everyone and how we do business. Despite the nationwide lockdown, we\nwere able to achieve this feat by reimagining our strategy and using resources\noptimally. We turned selling challenges into an opportunity by switching from\noffline to online sales with innovative technology. It's the thinking that\nmakes the difference and this has been the foundation for VTP's success\"\n\nSpeaking on strategy, Mr. Bhandari explains, \"Our customers expect us to\ndeliver beyond expectations and set higher benchmarks in the industry.\nDigitizing all our collateral and using interactive videos, online\nwalkthroughs to give them the best virtual experience possible from the safety\nof their homes. Moreover, as a brand we must deliver to their expectations no\nmatter what the operational challenges we face. Our sales and customer support\nteams have been very quick in adapting to the concept of selling virtually\"\n\nSell.Do, is our lead management partner and has been very useful, more so in\ntimes of virtual sales, in tracking every customer engagement and response\ntime. The system has been a valuable part of the delivery chain.\n\nKetan Sabnis, CEO, Sell.Do explains, \"We are so proud to associate with VTP\nand the team that continues to be leaders of the industry. In a crisis-\nsituation where real estate sales have slowed, VTP has thrived by quickly\ntransforming into a virtual selling engine. Their customer-centric approach\nand ability to develop long-term relationships with the customers is the\nbiggest reason for this success.\"\n\nPune boasts of around 1000+ developers and VTP Realty is among the most\nsuccessful players in the region today. VTP enabled their sales teams with\nbetter technology from Sell.Do providing Lead Management and Marketing\nAutomation.
