    "text": "When it comes to the top girls cross country runners in area history, you\ndon't have to dive too deep into the archives to find the cream of the crop.\n\nMany of the most accomplished runners the local area has ever seen have yet to\ngraduate, and can still continue to build upon impressive resumes before their\nhigh school careers are over. In concluding with our long-running series of\nthe top area athletes of all time, these distance runners held claims as some\nof the best in the state, and some still do.\n\nHere are the top girls cross country athletes:\n\nSHANNON LINDBERG, SOUTHINGTON, 1997\n\nLindberg made her mark at the high school level with an All-State selection in\n1997, but she didn't stop there. Lindberg went on to compete at Central\nConnecticut State University, where she came in sixth place at the Northeast\nConference Championships in 1998 to help the Blue Devils win the conference\ntitle, then came in ninth the following year to earn another all-conference\nnod and help CCSU clinch back-to-back conference titles.\n\nJUSTICE BOWSER, NEW BRITAIN, 2004\n\nBowser wasted little time in making her name known as a top cross country\nrunner, coming in ninth place overall as a sophomore at the Class LL state\nchampionships in 2002. Her performance secured an All-State nod, and she\nimpressed again the following year with an 11th-place finish at the state\nchampionships.\n\nSARA MOSKEY, BERLIN, 2005\n\nMoskey was part of a strong Redcoats team that finished fifth in the Class MM\nstate championships during her senior season. Moskey was All-State as a junior\nwith an eighth-place finish, when Berlin also picked up a top 10 finish at the\nstate level, coming in ninth place overall.\n\nLAUREN DIMITRUK, BERLIN, 2005\n\nMoskey was finished second on the Redcoats in the state championships as a\njunior and a senior, and the top finisher for Berlin both of those years was\nDimitruk, who came in third overall at the 2004 Class MM state championships\nto earn an All-State honor.\n\nJILLIAN SULLIVAN, BRISTOL CENTRAL, 2002\n\nSullivan earned a spot on the All-State team with a fifth-place finish at the\nstate championships as a junior in 2001, but her best was yet to come, as she\ncapped off her career with the Rams with a first-place finish in the Class L\nstate championships in 2002 with a time of 15:58. She also led Central to a\n14-0 season as a sophomore, cementing her claim as one of the best distance\nrunners the Rams have ever seen.\n\nJULIANA CANCELLIERI, BERLIN, 2020\n\nOne of the most accomplished runners in area history, Cancellieri went out\nwith a bang as a senior, taking eighth place at the 2019 Class M state\nchampionships to secure her remarkable third straight All-State selection.\nThis came shortly after she secured her first individual conference\nchampionship, and logged a time of 20:47 at the State Open after coming in the\ntop 50 the year before. Cancellier's three straight All-State nods made her\nthe first runner in Berlin history to achieve such an honor.\n\nKAILYN BIELECKI, ST. PAUL, 2020\n\nBielecki closed out her high school career in style last year, coming in 11th\nplace at the Class S state championships with a time of 21:06 to leave the\nFalcons as an All-State runner. She was named to the NVL's All-Iron division\nteam for the second straight season, and will continue her running career at\nSpringfield College.\n\nGRACE MICHAUD, SOUTHINGTON, 2021\n\nMichaud's career with the Blue Knights isn't even over yet, but she belongs on\nthis list. As a junior this past season, Michaud was named All-State after\ncoming in 10th in the Class LL state championships, logging a time of 19:45.\nShe also came in 25th at the State Open and 56th at the Footlocker Northeast\nRegional 5k Championship Race in 2019.\n\nJACKIE IZZO, SOUTHINGTON, 2022\n\nHow about an underclassman cracking this list? Well, when you have the resume\nof Michaud's teammate Izzo, it warrants a spot. Early in her sophomore season\nlast year, Izzo helped the Blue Knights win a tri-meet over Avon and Conard by\nbreaking the course record at Camp Sloper by more than 30 seconds, then\ncontinued that dominance with a fourth-place finish at the state championships\nwith a time of 19:22, 22nd-place result at the State Open, and logged a time\nof 19:03 at the New England Championships, the top mark in program history.\n\nKAITLYN DEFOREST, TERRYVILLE, 2022\n\nAnother underclassman makes our list, and for good reason. Deforest just\nmissed earning All-State as a freshman, but secured a third-place finish at\nthe Berkshire League Championship as a sophomore, and followed that up with an\nseventh-place finish at the Class S state championships thanks to an\nimpressive time of 20:36, capturing that All-State honor she was so close to\nhaving as a freshman. If she continues on this path, there will likely be a\nnumber of other All-State nods in the future.\n\nRyan Chichester can be reached at (860) 801-5094 or\n[rchichester@newbritianherald.com](mailto:rchichester@newbritianherald.com)",

    "html": "<p>When it comes to the top girls cross country runners in area history, you don't have to dive too deep into the archives to find the cream of the crop.</p>\n<p>Many of the most accomplished runners the local area has ever seen have yet to graduate, and can still continue to build upon impressive resumes before their high school careers are over. In concluding with our long-running series of the top area athletes of all time, these distance runners held claims as some of the best in the state, and some still do.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the top girls cross country athletes:</p>\n\n<p><person>SHANNON LINDBERG</person>, SOUTHINGTON, 1997</p>\n\n<p>Lindberg made her mark at the high school level with an All-State selection in 1997, but she didn't stop there. Lindberg went on to compete at <org>Central Connecticut State University</org>, where she came in sixth place at the Northeast Conference Championships in 1998 to help the <org>Blue Devils</org> win the conference title, then came in ninth the following year to earn another all-conference nod and help CCSU clinch back-to-back conference titles.</p>\n\n<p><person>JUSTICE BOWSER</person>, NEW BRITAIN, 2004</p>\n\n<p>Bowser wasted little time in making her name known as a top cross country runner, coming in ninth place overall as a sophomore at the Class LL state championships in 2002. Her performance secured an All-State nod, and she impressed again the following year with an 11th-place finish at the state championships.</p>\n\n<p><person>SARA MOSKEY</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">BERLIN</location>, 2005</p>\n\n<p>Moskey was part of a strong Redcoats team that finished fifth in the Class MM state championships during her senior season. Moskey was All-State as a junior with an eighth-place finish, when <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">Berlin</location> also picked up a top 10 finish at the state level, coming in ninth place overall.</p>\n\n<p><person>LAUREN DIMITRUK</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">BERLIN</location>, 2005</p>\n\n<p>Moskey was finished second on the Redcoats in the state championships as a junior and a senior, and the top finisher for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">Berlin</location> both of those years was Dimitruk, who came in third overall at the 2004 Class MM state championships to earn an All-State honor.</p>\n\n<p><person>JILLIAN SULLIVAN</person>, BRISTOL CENTRAL, 2002</p>\n\n<p>Sullivan earned a spot on the All-State team with a fifth-place finish at the state championships as a junior in 2001, but her best was yet to come, as she capped off her career with the Rams with a first-place finish in the Class L state championships in 2002 with a time of 15:58. She also led Central to a 14-0 season as a sophomore, cementing her claim as one of the best distance runners the Rams have ever seen.</p>\n\n<p><person>JULIANA CANCELLIERI</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">BERLIN</location>, 2020</p>\n\n<p>One of the most accomplished runners in area history, Cancellieri went out with a bang as a senior, taking eighth place at the 2019 Class M state championships to secure her remarkable third straight All-State selection. This came shortly after she secured her first individual conference championship, and logged a time of 20:47 at the State Open after coming in the top 50 the year before. Cancellier's three straight All-State nods made her the first runner in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/de..berlin\">Berlin</location> history to achieve such an honor.</p>\n\n<p><person>KAILYN BIELECKI</person>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.stpaul\">ST. PAUL</location>, 2020</p>\n\n<p>Bielecki closed out her high school career in style last year, coming in 11th place at the Class S state championships with a time of 21:06 to leave the <org>Falcons</org> as an All-State runner. She was named to the NVL's All-Iron division team for the second straight season, and will continue her running career at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0662620738\">Springfield College</org>.</p>\n\n<p><person>GRACE MICHAUD</person>, SOUTHINGTON, 2021</p>\n\n<p>Michaud's career with the Blue Knights isn't even over yet, but she belongs on this list. As a junior this past season, Michaud was named All-State after coming in 10th in the Class LL state championships, logging a time of 19:45. She also came in 25th at the State Open and 56th at the <org>Footlocker Northeast Regional</org> 5k Championship Race in 2019.</p>\n\n<p><person>JACKIE IZZO</person>, SOUTHINGTON, 2022</p>\n\n<p>How about an underclassman cracking this list? Well, when you have the resume of Michaud's teammate Izzo, it warrants a spot. Early in her sophomore season last year, Izzo helped the Blue Knights win a tri-meet over <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.avon\">Avon</location> and Conard by breaking the course record at <location>Camp Sloper</location> by more than 30 seconds, then continued that dominance with a fourth-place finish at the state championships with a time of 19:22, 22nd-place result at the State Open, and logged a time of 19:03 at the New England Championships, the top mark in program history.</p>\n\n<p><person>KAITLYN DEFOREST</person>, TERRYVILLE, 2022</p>\n\n<p>Another underclassman makes our list, and for good reason. Deforest just missed earning All-State as a freshman, but secured a third-place finish at the Berkshire League Championship as a sophomore, and followed that up with an seventh-place finish at the Class S state championships thanks to an impressive time of 20:36, capturing that All-State honor she was so close to having as a freshman. If she continues on this path, there will likely be a number of other All-State nods in the future.</p>\n\n<p><person>Ryan Chichester</person> can be reached at (860) 801-5094 or <a href=\"mailto:rchichester@newbritianherald.com\">rchichester@newbritianherald.com</a></p>",
