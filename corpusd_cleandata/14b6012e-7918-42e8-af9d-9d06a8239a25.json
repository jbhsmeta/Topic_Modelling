These all involved a patient falling and\ndying or getting seriously injured as a result.\n\n23 were 'criminal events', which include sexual assaults or serious physical\nattacks.\n\nDr Mary Tumelty, a lecturer UCC's school of law, said: \"The numbers highlight\nthat systems need to be made better. Where serious reportable offences occur\noften the human cost on the patients and their families is incalculable.\n\n\"It's essential that safety incidents are reported and investigated and\nlessons are learned.\"\n\nThe HSE says the health service has millions of interactions with patients and\nservice-users every year, and there is often excellent care, but it says\nadverse events and patient harm can and do occur.\n\n[readmore]1003286[/readmore]",
