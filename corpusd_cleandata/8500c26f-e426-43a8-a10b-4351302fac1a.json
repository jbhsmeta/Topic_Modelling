    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Technology\nBusiness Daily \\-- A patent application by the inventors Torii, Sota\n(Kawasaki-shi, Japan); Iwashita, Atsushi (Tokyo, Japan); Terui, Kosuke\n(Yokohama-shi, Japan); Tsukuda, Akira (Kawasaki-shi, Japan), filed on January\n22, 2020, was made available online on May 21, 2020, according to news\nreporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx correspondents.\n\nThis patent application is assigned to Canon Kabushiki Kaisha (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nThe following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background\ninformation supplied by the inventors: \"Field of the Invention\n\n\"The present invention relates to a radiation imaging apparatus and a\nradiation imaging system.\n\n\"Background Art\n\n\"In medical image diagnosis or nondestructive inspection, a radiation imaging\napparatus using a flat panel detector (FPD) made of a semiconductor material\nis widely used. One known imaging method using an FPD is a method of acquiring\nan energy subtraction image using radiations of different energy components.\nPTL 1 shows a radiation imaging apparatus using a DXA (Dual X-ray\nAbsorptiometry) method that repetitively irradiates an object with high-energy\nradiation and low-energy radiation and performs imaging. Generally, in an\nobject with a thick body, the detection value (count) of radiation at the time\nof low-energy radiation imaging is much smaller than the count of radiation at\nthe time of high-energy radiation imaging, as compared to an object of an\naverage physical constitution. PTL 1 shows that to equalize the counts of\nradiations detected in imaging using high-energy radiation and low-energy\nradiation, the ratio of the times over which low-energy radiation and high-\nenergy radiation are repetitively alternately generated by a radiation\ngeneration unit is controlled.\"\n\nIn addition to the background information obtained for this patent\napplication, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary\ninformation for this patent application: \"According to some embodiments, a\nradiation imaging apparatus comprising a detection unit configured to generate\nan image signal according to radiation emitted by a radiation source, an image\nprocessing unit, and a control unit, wherein the control unit performs first\nimaging and second imaging performed after the first imaging using radiations\nof different energies, the image processing unit generates an energy\nsubtraction image using a first image signal generated by the detection unit\nin the first imaging and a second image signal generated by the detection unit\nin the second imaging, and the second imaging is performed under a radiation\nirradiation condition according to a noise amount included in the first image\nsignal, is provided.\n\n\"Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the\nfollowing description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached\ndrawings.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\.

One known imaging method using an FPD is a method of acquiring an energy subtraction image using radiations of different energy components. PTL 1 shows a radiation imaging apparatus using a DXA (Dual X-ray Absorptiometry) method that repetitively irradiates an object with high-energy radiation and low-energy radiation and performs imaging. Generally, in an object with a thick body, the detection value (count) of radiation at the time of low-energy radiation imaging is much smaller than the count of radiation at the time of high-energy radiation imaging, as compared to an object of an average physical constitution. PTL 1 shows that to equalize the counts of radiations detected in imaging using high-energy radiation and low-energy radiation, the ratio of the times over which low-energy radiation and high-energy radiation are repetitively alternately generated by a radiation generation unit is controlled.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;According to some embodiments, a radiation imaging apparatus comprising a detection unit configured to generate an image signal according to radiation emitted by a radiation source, an image processing unit, and a control unit, wherein the control unit performs first imaging and second imaging performed after the first imaging using radiations of different energies, the image processing unit generates an energy subtraction image using a first image signal generated by the detection unit in the first imaging and a second image signal generated by the detection unit in the second imaging, and the second imaging is performed under a radiation irradiation condition according to a noise amount included in the first image signal, is provided.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
