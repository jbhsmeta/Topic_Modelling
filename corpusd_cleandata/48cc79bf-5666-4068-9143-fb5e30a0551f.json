    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Network Daily\nNews \\-- Research findings on Networks - Neural Networks are discussed in a\nnew report. According to news reporting from Jinhua, People's Republic of\nChina, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nhave become a topic of intense research recently due to their powerful\ncapability in high-dimensional classification and regression tasks for graph-\nstructured data. However, as GNNs typically define the graph convolution by\nthe orthonormal basis for the graph Laplacian, they suffer from high\ncomputational cost when the graph size is large.\"\n\nFunders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina, Australian Research Council, Research Grants Council, University Grants\nCommittee, China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation.\n\nThe news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang\nNormal University, \"This paper introduces a Haar basis, which is a sparse and\nlocalized orthonormal system for a coarse-grained chain on the graph. The\ngraph convolution under Haar basis, called Haar convolution, can be defined\naccordingly for GNNs. The sparsity and locality of the Haar basis allow Fast\nHaar Transforms (FHTs) on the graph, by which one then achieves a fast\nevaluation of Haar convolution between graph data and filters.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We conduct\nexperiments on GNNs equipped with Haar convolution, which demonstrates state-\nof-the-art results on graph-based regression and node classification tasks.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Fast Haar Transforms for Graph\nNeural Networks. _Neural Networks_ , 2020;128():188-198. (Elsevier \\-\n[www.elsevier.com](http://www.elsevier.com); Neural Networks -\n<http://www.journals.elsevier.com/neural-networks/>)\n\nOur news journalists report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting M. Li, Dept. of Educational Technology, Zhejiang Normal University,\nJinhua, People's Republic of China. Additional authors for this research\ninclude Z. Ma, Y.G. Wang and X.

    "title": "New Neural Networks Study Findings Have Been Reported by Researchers at Zhejiang Normal University (Fast Haar Transforms for Graph Neural Networks): Networks - Neural Networks",
    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Network Daily News</org> -- Research findings on Networks - Neural Networks are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from Jinhua, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a topic of intense research recently due to their powerful capability in high-dimensional classification and regression tasks for graph-structured data. However, as GNNs typically define the graph convolution by the orthonormal basis for the graph Laplacian, they suffer from high computational cost when the graph size is large.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Funders for this research include <org>National Natural Science Foundation</org> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, <org>Australian Research Council</org>, <org>Research Grants Council</org>, University Grants Committee, <org>China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation</org>.</p>\n<p>The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from <org>Zhejiang Normal University</org>, &#8220;This paper introduces a Haar basis, which is a sparse and localized orthonormal system for a coarse-grained chain on the graph. The graph convolution under Haar basis, called Haar convolution, can be defined accordingly for GNNs. The sparsity and locality of the Haar basis allow Fast Haar Transforms (FHTs) on the graph, by which one then achieves a fast evaluation of Haar convolution between graph data and filters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;We conduct experiments on GNNs equipped with Haar convolution, which demonstrates state-of-the-art results on graph-based regression and node classification tasks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Fast Haar Transforms for Graph Neural Networks. <em>Neural Networks</em>, 2020;128():188-198.
