    "text": "If a proposed moratorium on US mergers was to go ahead it could have\ndisastrous effects on the market and add increased pressure in areas already\nunder stress.\n\nLast week Congressman David Cicilline, head of the US House antitrust\nsubcommittee, proposed including a temporary moratorium on all mergers in the\nnext Covid-19 bill. Cicilline told Politico that: \"As millions of businesses\nstruggle to stay afloat, private equity firms and dominant corporations are\npositioned to swoop in for a buying spree.\"\n\nThe proposal would allow for mergers of firms undergoing bankruptcy or on the\nverge of failure.\n\n\"This is not complicated. Our country can leave room for merger activity that\nis necessary to ensuring that distressed firms have a fresh start through the\nbankruptcy process or through necessary divestitures while also ensuring that\nwe do not undergo another period of rampant consolidation,\" he added.\n\nHowever, sources have told IFLR that if this proposed ban were to gain\ntraction and pass through congress the ramifications would outweigh the\nbenefits.\n\n\"Allowing this proposal to move forward with these exceptions might actually\ncreate additional pressure or accelerate proposed acquisitions of smaller\nrivals. Bigger firms targeting smaller, potentially failing firms is not\nokay,\" said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. \"That\nthat is an exempted form of consolidation.\"\n\n\"This was a concern anyway given the higher levels of concentration, the\nemergence of large firms and a pattern of acquisitions,\" she added. \"Allowing\nthat to move forward under the moratorium might actually accelerate those\ntypes of proposals. That is not something that we would want to see in the\nlonger term.\"\n\nThe proposed moratorium is predictable and understandable given the situation\nof the US economy. There is documented evidence of the underlying systemic\nproblems in the US regarding competition, which has seen a stark decline over\nthe last few years. The backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis provides a platform\nfor legislative proposals temporarily to halt merger activity.\n\n_**See also: Managing an extreme corporate crisis, lessons from Rolls Royce**_\n\nBruce Hoffman, former director of competition at the Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC) and now a partner at Cleary Gottlieb, understands the impulse behind the\nproposal but does not consider it necessary, going as far as to say that it\nwould be harmful.\n\n\"There are a lot of reasons for transactions. Some transactions can increase\nefficiency, or improve the financial condition of firms that are actually\nproviding a service that's relevant to responding to the pandemic,\" he said,\nadding: \"The 'truly failing' or bankruptcy exception would be grossly under\ninclusive for any circumstance where either firm might be able to improve the\nproduction or distribution of materials by those firms that might be in\nfinancial distress, or simply unable to provide the best service or\ndistribution possible.\"\n\nMerging could put these firms in a better position to provide that service, or\nresult in a circumstance where two firms pool two different assets in order to\naddress a specific part of the pandemic.\n\n\"There is a lot of potential for harm.\"\n\n **\"There is a lot of potential for harm\"**  \n  \n---  \n  \nOther mergers, that don't involve failing firms that could have potentially\nsignificant deficiencies, could also help keep the markets afloat and the\neconomy moving.\n\n **Political challenges**\n\nThe biggest question is whether this would get politically would get any\ntraction if it were to come out as part of a stimulus package or as a\nstandalone bill. Either way it would require bipartisan support, which is\nunlikely.\n\nAny bill that were to move forward on a moratorium would have to be extremely\nspecific and consider the potential ramifications of the incentives created.\n\"After the moratorium there will likely be a lot of energy and pent up\nproposals for acquisitions and mergers, and legislation would need to address\nthat,\" said Moss.\n\n\"One very practical question is if there is more pent up consolidation\nactivity, incentives and proposals to consolidate, how the agencies will deal\nwith this tidal wave coming at them afterward,\" she added.\n\nThere have also been suggestions that the proposal is based on a pre-existing\nantipathy for private equity in general.\n\n\"That concern is just totally misplaced. There's no indication that\nacquisitions by private equity firms create any kind of competitive harm. To\nthe contrary, private equity can have no involvement in a particular industry\nand shore it up, with financial assets and managerial capabilities,\" said\nHoffman.\n\nA private equity firm might not compete in a market where some of the\ncompanies who do are really struggling and might need financial support. In\nthat situation, the private equity firm could provide that support without\nreducing competition. Some companies that are really struggling really need\nfinancial support. \"The last thing the government should be doing is making it\nharder for companies to get financial support from acquirers that are not\nstrategic presences in the markets in which they're competing,\" he concluded.\n\n_**See also: Coronavirus, private equity investing in a distressed\nenvironment**_",

    "title": "Cicilline's proposed merger ban will do more harm than good",
    "html": "<p>If a proposed moratorium on US mergers was to go ahead it could have disastrous effects on the market and add increased pressure in areas already under stress. </p><p>Last week Congressman <person>David Cicilline</person>, head of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0054902789\">US House</org> antitrust subcommittee, proposed including a temporary moratorium on all mergers in the next Covid-19 bill. Cicilline told <org>Politico</org> that: &#8220;As millions of businesses struggle to stay afloat, private equity firms and dominant corporations are positioned to swoop in for a buying spree.&#8221; </p><p>The proposal would allow for mergers of firms undergoing bankruptcy or on the verge of failure.</p><p>&#8220;This is not complicated. Our country can leave room for merger activity that is necessary to ensuring that distressed firms have a fresh start through the bankruptcy process or through necessary divestitures while also ensuring that we do not undergo another period of rampant consolidation,\" he added. </p><p>However, sources have told IFLR that if this proposed ban were to gain traction and pass through congress the ramifications would outweigh the benefits. </p><p>\"Allowing this proposal to move forward with these exceptions might actually create additional pressure or accelerate proposed acquisitions of smaller rivals. Bigger firms targeting smaller, potentially failing firms is not okay,\" said <person>Diana Moss</person>, president of the <org>American Antitrust Institute</org>. \"That that is an exempted form of consolidation.\" </p><p>\"This was a concern anyway given the higher levels of concentration, the emergence of large firms and a pattern of acquisitions,\" she added. \"Allowing that to move forward under the moratorium might actually accelerate those types of proposals. That is not something that we would want to see in the longer term.\"</p><p>The proposed moratorium is predictable and understandable given the situation of the US economy. There is documented evidence of the underlying systemic problems in the US regarding competition, which has seen a stark decline over the last few years. The backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis provides a platform for legislative proposals temporarily to halt merger activity. </p><p><i><b>See also: Managing an extreme corporate crisis, lessons from Rolls Royce</b></i></p><p><person>Bruce Hoffman</person>, former director of competition at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2373566280\">Federal Trade Commission</org> (FTC) and now a partner at Cleary Gottlieb, understands the impulse behind the proposal but does not consider it necessary, going as far as to say that it would be harmful. </p><p>\"There are a lot of reasons for transactions. Some transactions can increase efficiency, or improve the financial condition of firms that are actually providing a service that's relevant to responding to the pandemic,\" he said, adding: \"The &#8216;truly failing&#8217; or bankruptcy exception would be grossly under inclusive for any circumstance where either firm might be able to improve the production or distribution of materials by those firms that might be in financial distress, or simply unable to provide the best service or distribution possible.\"</p><p>Merging could put these firms in a better position to provide that service, or result in a circumstance where two firms pool two different assets in order to address a specific part of the pandemic. </p><p>\"There is a lot of potential for harm.\"</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>\"There is a lot of potential for harm\"</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Other mergers, that don't involve failing firms that could have potentially significant deficiencies, could also help keep the markets afloat and the economy moving.</p><p><b>Political challenges</b></p><p>The biggest question is whether this would get politically would get any traction if it were to come out as part of a stimulus package or as a standalone bill. Either way it would require bipartisan support, which is unlikely. </p><p>Any bill that were to move forward on a moratorium would have to be extremely specific and consider the potential ramifications of the incentives created. \"After the moratorium there will likely be a lot of energy and pent up proposals for acquisitions and mergers, and legislation would need to address that,\" said Moss. </p><p>\"One very practical question is if there is more pent up consolidation activity, incentives and proposals to consolidate, how the agencies will deal with this tidal wave coming at them afterward,\" she added. </p><p>There have also been suggestions that the proposal is based on a pre-existing antipathy for private equity in general. </p><p>\"That concern is just totally misplaced. There's no indication that acquisitions by private equity firms create any kind of competitive harm. To the contrary, private equity can have no involvement in a particular industry and shore it up, with financial assets and managerial capabilities,\" said Hoffman. </p><p>A private equity firm might not compete in a market where some of the companies who do are really struggling and might need financial support. In that situation, the private equity firm could provide that support without reducing competition. Some companies that are really struggling really need financial support. \"The last thing the government should be doing is making it harder for companies to get financial support from acquirers that are not strategic presences in the markets in which they're competing,\" he concluded. </p><p><i><b>See also: Coronavirus, private equity investing in a distressed environment</b></i></p>",
