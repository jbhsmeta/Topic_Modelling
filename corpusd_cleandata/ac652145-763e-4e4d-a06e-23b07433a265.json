There were no finders' fees payable on this tranche.\n\nThe offering was priced in the context of the market based on a price\nreservation made by the company with the Canadian Securities Exchange. The\nprivate placement is subject to the approval of the CSE, and the securities\nwill be subject to a four-month hold period under securities laws. The company\nintends to use the net proceeds from the private placement for working capital\npurposes.\n\nEach unit consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant.\nEach warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at a price of 10\ncents for a period of three years from the issue date. The warrants are\nsubject to an acceleration provision that allows the company to give notice of\nan earlier expiry date if the company's share price on the Canadian Securities\nExchange (or such other stock exchange that the company may be trading on) is\nequal to or greater than 20 cents for a period of 10 consecutive trading days.\n\nFurther to the company's press release dated June 2, 2020, the company would\nlike to correct its disclosure to clarify that the number of common shares of\nthe company issued in connection with the shares-for-debt transaction was\n566,677 common shares at a deemed price per share of eight cents.\n\nAbout MYM Nutraceuticals Inc.\n\nMYM is a licensed cannabis producer in Canada. It is uniquely positioned to\nopportunistically acquire and/or invest in companies within the cannabis and\nhemp industries that are in need of capital and management support.
