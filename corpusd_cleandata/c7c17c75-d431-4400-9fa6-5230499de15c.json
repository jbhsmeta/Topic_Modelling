    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx\nCOVID-19 Daily \\-- Investigators publish new report on coronavirus. According\nto news reporting out of Huazhong University of Science and Technology by\nNewsRx editors, research stated, \"A cluster of patients with coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were discharged from hospitals in Wuhan,\nChina. We aimed to determine the cumulative percentage of complete\nradiological resolution at each time point, to explore the relevant affecting\nfactors, and to describe the chest CT findings at different time points after\nhospital discharge.\"\n\nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Huazhong University\nof Science and Technology: \"Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-\nPCR who were discharged consecutively from the hospital between 5 February\n2020 and 10 March 2020 and who underwent serial chest CT scans on schedule\nwere enrolled. The radiological characteristics of all patients were collected\nand analysed. The total CT score was the sum of non-GGO involvement determined\nat discharge. Afterwards, all patients underwent chest CT scans during the\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge. Imaging features and distributions\nwere analysed across different time points. A total of 149 patients who\ncompleted all CT scans were evaluated; there were 67 (45.0%) men and 82\n(55.0%) women, with a median age of 43 years old (IQR 36-56). The cumulative\npercentage of complete radiological resolution was 8.1% (12 patients), 41.6%\n(62), 50.3% (75), and 53.0% (79) at discharge and during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\nweeks after discharge, respectively. Patients 44 years old showed a\nsignificantly higher cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution\nthan patients > 44 years old at the 3-week follow-up. The predominant patterns\nof abnormalities observed at discharge were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (125\n[83.9%]), fibrous stripe (81 [54.4%]), and thickening of the adjacent pleura\n(33 [22.1%]). The positive count of GGO, fibrous stripe and thickening of the\nadjacent pleura gradually decreased, while GGO and fibrous stripe showed\nobvious resolution during the first week and the third week after discharge,\nrespectively. 'Tinted' sign and bronchovascular bundle distortion as two\nspecial features were discovered during the evolution.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Lung lesions in\nCOVID-19 pneumonia patients can be absorbed completely during short-term\nfollow-up with no sequelae. Two weeks after discharge might be the optimal\ntime point for early radiological estimation.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: The pulmonary sequalae in\ndischarged patients with COVID-19: a short-term observational study.\n_Respiratory Research_ , 2020,21(1):1-7.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>NewsRx COVID-19 Daily</org> -- Investigators publish new report on coronavirus. According to news reporting out of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2126604219\">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</org> by NewsRx editors, research stated, &#8220;A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were discharged from hospitals in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..wuhan\">Wuhan, China</location>. We aimed to determine the cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution at each time point, to explore the relevant affecting factors, and to describe the chest CT findings at different time points after hospital discharge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2126604219\">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</org>: &#8220;Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR who were discharged consecutively from the hospital between <chron>5 February 2020</chron> and <chron>10 March 2020</chron> and who underwent serial chest CT scans on schedule were enrolled. The radiological characteristics of all patients were collected and analysed. The total CT score was the sum of non-GGO involvement determined at discharge. Afterwards, all patients underwent chest CT scans during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge. Imaging features and distributions were analysed across different time points. A total of 149 patients who completed all CT scans were evaluated; there were 67 (45.0%) men and 82 (55.0%) women, with a median age of 43 years old (IQR 36-56). The cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution was 8.1% (12 patients), 41.6% (62), 50.3% (75), and 53.0% (79) at discharge and during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks after discharge, respectively. Patients 44 years old showed a significantly higher cumulative percentage of complete radiological resolution than patients &gt; 44 years old at the 3-week follow-up. The predominant patterns of abnormalities observed at discharge were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (125 [83.9%]), fibrous stripe (81 [54.4%]), and thickening of the adjacent pleura (33 [22.1%]). The positive count of GGO, fibrous stripe and thickening of the adjacent pleura gradually decreased, while GGO and fibrous stripe showed obvious resolution during the first week and the third week after discharge, respectively. &#8216;Tinted&#8217; sign and bronchovascular bundle distortion as two special features were discovered during the evolution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia patients can be absorbed completely during short-term follow-up with no sequelae. Two weeks after discharge might be the optimal time point for early radiological estimation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: The pulmonary sequalae in discharged patients with COVID-19: a short-term observational study. <em><org>Respiratory Research</org></em>, 2020,21(1):1-7.
