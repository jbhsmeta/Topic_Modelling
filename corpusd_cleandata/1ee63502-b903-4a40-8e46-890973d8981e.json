    "text": "A teenager who cultivated a commercial scale cannabis factory in Ipswich to\npay for being smuggled into the country has been jailed for 10 months.\n\nKlodian Nikoci was put straight to work tending the operation inside a one-\nbedroom flat after being brought into the UK by truck, Ipswich Crown Court\nheard.\n\nThe 19-year-old was alone in the first-floor property in St George's Street\nwhen police executed a warrant at 10.05am on January 15.\n\nProsecutor Russell Butcher said Nikoci climbed from a window onto the roof of\nan adjacent car repair centre but soon complied with instructions to descend\nand surrender himself to officers.\n\nThe Albanian national told police he was working to pay off a debt incurred\nfrom his illegal transportation to the country, but offered no comment to\nquestions during a recorded interview.\n\nMr Butcher said the flat contained 43 female cannabis plants, nearing\nmaturity, with a potential yield of up to 3.6kg and worth up to \u00a336,000 on the\nstreet.\n\nHe said officers also found specialist growing equipment powered by\nelectricity that appeared to have been bypassed.\n\nCraig Marchant, mitigating, said Nikoci had been cooperative after his brief\nescape attempt and pleaded guilty to producing cannabis between December 12\nand January 14 at the earliest opportunity before magistrates the day after\nhis arrest.\n\nHe said Nikoci, who was sleeping on a camp bed in the flat, had naively taken\non the role of watering plants to repay his debt.\n\n\"I can't say his vulnerability was exploited, but his explanation of being\ntaken to the flat and promised work to pay off the debt suggests an element of\ncoercion that adds to his naivety,\" he added.\n\nJudge Emma Peters accepted Nikoci played a limited role, but said: \"Let's be\nclear, you were involved in a large operation capable of producing significant\nquantities of cannabis on a commercial scale.\n\n\"It is accepted you performed a limited role under direction and were a\nrelatively naive young man, but I'm acutely conscious you had motivation in\norder to pay off a debt incurred by being brought into the country illegally a\nmonth before.\"\n\nNikoci was jailed for 10 months but will soon be eligible for release, having\nserved almost half in custody since his arrest.\n\nJudge Peters said his possible deportation would be a matter for the UK Border\nAgency.",
