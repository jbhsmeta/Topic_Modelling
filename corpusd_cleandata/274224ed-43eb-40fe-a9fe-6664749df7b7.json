    "text": "Bartlesville, Oklahoma\n\nConstruction Manager & Cost Estimator\n\nMcAnaw Construction Company\n\nTri County Tech School was started in 1967. Tri County Tech of Bartlesville is\na public career technology education center located in Bartlesville, Oklahoma,\nand is part of the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education\nsystem.\n\nTri County Tech serves residents in the northeast Oklahoma counties of\nWashington, Nowata and Osage, Oklahoma with over 600 full time students. The\ntotal cost of the new Student Center/ Networking Addition & Remodel was\n$1,047,000, and the funding for the project was allocated from the schools\nbudget.\n\nThe project included the demolition of the old student center. This entailed\nremoving and replacing exterior brick veneer entry columns, landscape, and\ninterior walls, finishes, interior brick veneer/ columns, ceilings, lighting,\nhandicap ramp, and stairs that were built back in the early 1980s by McAnaw\nConstruction and remodeled in 2017-2018 by McAnaw Construction almost 38 years\nlater.\n\nConstruction started in the middle of 2017, which included the interior\nremodel and exterior site work on the property, all while keeping the existing\nschool building open until the new Student Center was complete.\n\nThe exterior has aluminum storefront doors and windows, and alu inu windows\nthat were cut in on the north side of the facility, brick veneer and a single\nply membrane roof. The interior has faculty offices, faculty break room,\nrestroom partitions, metal studs and drywall with wood planks and aluminum\nstorefront doors/window partitions at the offices.\n\nThe interior itself gives a sense of openness due to multiple glass doors and\nlarge glass windows, and pendant linear LED lighting. Ornamental railings, and\ncarpet tile floor patterns, along with large vinyl tile thru-out the facility\nprovide contrast and visibility.\n\nPainted ceilings and soffits along with wood planks cover walls for durability\nand contrasting design. When you enter the student center there is a new\nreception desk and seating area for the students, along with a raised floor\narea with a new open office system adjacent to the main entry for faculty.\n\nThe new networking area included a new state-of-the-art seating area for\nstudents to be able to sit with their laptops and work on their studies with\nfull internet access.\n\nThis project is just one of the many interior remodels that KKT Architects and\nMcAnaw Construction have done with Tri County Tech over the last several\nyears. By updating the facility to meet today s technology standards and\nmodernize the environment, the students are giving the faculty a revitalized\nsense of accomplishment.\n\nOverall, the project was a great success for Tri County Tech faculty and\nstudents.\n\nConstruction Manager & Cost Estimator\n\nMcAnaw Construction Company\n\n1700 Hensley Boulevard, Bartlesville, OK 74003\n\n[www.mcanawconstruction.com](http://www.mcanawconstruction.com)\n\nProject Team\n\nArchitect & Structural Engineer\n\nKKT Architects, Inc.\n\n2200 South Utica Place, #200, Tulsa, OK 74114\n\nMechanical & Electrical Engineer\n\nTFK Engineering, Inc.\n\n2604 W.

The total cost of the new Student Center/ Networking Addition &amp; Remodel was <money>$1,047,000</money>, and the funding for the project was allocated from the schools budget.</p>\n<p>The project included the demolition of the old student center. This entailed removing and replacing exterior brick veneer entry columns, landscape, and interior walls, finishes, interior brick veneer/ columns, ceilings, lighting, handicap ramp, and stairs that were built back in the early 1980s by <org>McAnaw Construction</org> and remodeled in 2017-2018 by <org>McAnaw Construction</org> almost 38 years later.</p>\n<p>Construction started in the middle of 2017, which included the interior remodel and exterior site work on the property, all while keeping the existing school building open until the new Student Center was complete.</p>\n<p>The exterior has aluminum storefront doors and windows, and alu inu windows that were cut in on the north side of the facility, brick veneer and a single ply membrane roof. The interior has faculty offices, faculty break room, restroom partitions, metal studs and drywall with wood planks and aluminum storefront doors/window partitions at the offices.</p>\n<p>The interior itself gives a sense of openness due to multiple glass doors and large glass windows, and pendant linear LED lighting. Ornamental railings, and carpet tile floor patterns, along with large vinyl tile thru-out the facility provide contrast and visibility.</p>\n<p>Painted ceilings and soffits along with wood planks cover walls for durability and contrasting design. When you enter the student center there is a new reception desk and seating area for the students, along with a raised floor area with a new open office system adjacent to the main entry for faculty.</p>\n<p>The new networking area included a new state-of-the-art seating area for students to be able to sit with their laptops and work on their studies with full internet access.</p>\n<p>This project is just one of the many interior remodels that <org>KKT Architects</org> and <org>McAnaw Construction</org> have done with <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3859332317\">Tri County Tech</org> over the last several years. By updating the facility to meet today s technology standards and modernize the environment, the students are giving the faculty a revitalized sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project was a great success for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3859332317\">Tri County Tech</org> faculty and students.</p>\n<p>Construction Manager &amp; Cost Estimator</p>\n<p><org>McAnaw Construction Company</org></p>\n<p><location>1700 Hensley Boulevard</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.barlle\">Bartlesville, OK</location> 74003</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mcanawconstruction.com\">www.mcanawconstruction.com</a></p>\n<p>Project Team</p>\n<p>Architect &amp; Structural Engineer</p>\n<p><org>KKT Architects, Inc.</org></p>\n<p><location>2200 South Utica Place</location>, #200, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ok.tulsa\">Tulsa, OK</location> 74114</p>\n<p>Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineer</p>\n<p><org>TFK Engineering, Inc.</org></p>\n<p><location>2604 W.
