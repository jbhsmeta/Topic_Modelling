She\nattended school in the Preston School District and graduated from Preston High\nSchool and Seminary in 2002. She was a hard worker and excelled in her school\nwork. Although being \"shy\", she loved people and remembered them and their\nnames. Even going so far as to write down their phone numbers and birthdays.\nShe was big on calling you on your birthday and sending a card. Brittany\nenjoyed riding her bikes, taking care of her pet cat and dogs (and the\nneighbors' too).\n\nShe has been the greatest daughter, sister, aunt and friend the world could\nhave known. Brittany will be missed by all who knew her. She had an infectious\nlaugh and smile. She was a talkative person once you got to know her.\n\nBrittany is survived by her parents, Jim & Nancy Christensen; two brothers,\nChad Christensen and Dan Christensen; her nieces and nephews; and by her\naunts, uncles and cousins. She was preceded in death by both sets of\ngrandparents, her brother, Brian Christensen and by her nephew, Kodi\nChristensen.\n\nFuneral services were held on Tuesday, May 26, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. at Webb\nFuneral Home, 1005 South 800 East, Preston, Idaho. The family gathered with\nfriends and relatives on Monday from 4-8 p.m. and Tuesday from 9:30-10:30 a.m.\nboth at Webb Funeral Home. For those not able to be with us, the funeral\nservices were streamed and may be watched by clicking on the following link:\n<https://youtu.be/bQO9j64_L50bvd> on her obituary at\n[webbmortuary.com](http://webbmortuary.com)\n\nWebb Funeral Home will also have an audio version of the service soon on their\nwebsite at webbmortuary. com. Interment will be in the Preston Cemetery.\nMemories and condolences may be shared with the family at\n[webbmortuary.com](http://webbmortuary.com)",

She attended school in the <org>Preston School District</org> and graduated from <org>Preston High School</org> and Seminary in 2002. She was a hard worker and excelled in her school work. Although being \"shy\", she loved people and remembered them and their names. Even going so far as to write down their phone numbers and birthdays. She was big on calling you on your birthday and sending a card. Brittany enjoyed riding her bikes, taking care of her pet cat and dogs (and the neighbors' too).</p>\n\n<p>She has been the greatest daughter, sister, aunt and friend the world could have known. Brittany will be missed by all who knew her. She had an infectious laugh and smile. She was a talkative person once you got to know her.</p>\n\n<p>Brittany is survived by her parents, Jim &amp; <person>Nancy Christensen</person>; two brothers, <person>Chad Christensen</person> and <person>Dan Christensen</person>; her nieces and nephews; and by her aunts, uncles and cousins. She was preceded in death by both sets of grandparents, her brother, <person>Brian Christensen</person> and by her nephew, <person>Kodi Christensen</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Funeral services were held on <chron>Tuesday, May 26, 2020</chron> at <chron>11:00 a.m.</chron> at <org>Webb Funeral Home</org>, 1005 South 800 East, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.id.presto\">Preston, Idaho</location>.
