    "text": "By Mike Crismundo\n\nBUTUAN CITY - The regional office of the Commission on Population and\nDevelopment (POPCOM) has aligned its population management program right at\nthe communities with the over-all health care program of the Department of\nHealth (DOH).\n\nIn its bid to help curb the rising cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19),\nPOPCOM-Caraga on Thursday implemented the Population, Health and Development\n(PHD) strategy where logistical and financial support are extended to the\nlocal government units (LGUs).\n\n\"POPCOM's strategy ensures that couples and individuals shall be assisted in\naddressing their reproductive health concerns, particularly in managing\npregnancy, to guarantee the health and safety of the entire family, POPCOM 13\nRegional Director Alexander A. Makinano said.\n\nPOPCOM is working with DOH in the delivery of the commodities for modern\nfamily planning to the provincial and city health offices of Caraga region for\ndistribution to the health centers of the 67 towns and barangays, Makinano\ntold The Manila Bulletin on Thursday.\n\n\"It is expected that the health centers can continuously provide the services\nto the couples and individuals especially during this national health crisis\nthrough quality, scientific, and safer methods of family planning,\" he added.\n\nPopulation workers and volunteers of the local governments are getting\nlogistical support extended by POPCOM in the delivery of services along the\npopulation program for years. POPCOM has been extending support to local\nhealth workers for three years now.\n\nPOPCOM's support is also designed so that LGUs can be assisted in preventing\nuntimely pregnancies during this crisis. Community workers and volunteers are\ngetting material and financial support to equip young people with appropriate\nknowledge and skills in postponing their fertility concerns.\n\nPOPCOM is eyeing to expand its network to the academe, private sector, and\nyouth leaders in molding responsible behavior among the younger generation. In\nthe study commissioned by POPCOM with the University of the Philippines, a\nsignificant proportion of young people are engaging in sexual activities which\nexposed themselves to the risky complications of teenage pregnancy or sexually\ntransmitted infections, including HIV-AIDS.\n\nPOPCOM had earlier launched its Responsible Parenthood-Family Planning (RP-FP)\nHotlines to assist the communities in educating the public on matters\ninvolving their safety and health during the pandemic. Trained social workers\nof POPCOM will respond to the messages and calls from the public on\n0995-1550746 (Globe) and 0951-0419159 (Smart) during working hours Monday to\nFriday.\n\nSome of POPCOM's personnel shall be fielded to the LGUs to assist in the\nsurveillance and contact tracing activities on COVID-19 cases.\n\nIn a joint memorandum with the DOH, POPCOM said that population workers and\nvolunteers, and other non-health personnel of the LGUs shall be mobilized for\ncontact tracing, Makinano said.\n\nDOH Secretary Francisco T. Duque III has re-certified all officials and\nemployees of POPCOM nationwide as public health workers under the national law\nfor Public Health Workers.\n\nDuque said POPCOM is engaging in health and health-related works along the\nnational program on family planning.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nPhoto courtesy of POPCOM 13 Caraga via Mike U.

Makinano</person>\nsaid.</p>\n\n<p>POPCOM is working with DOH in the delivery of the commodities for\nmodern family planning to the provincial and city health offices of\nCaraga region for distribution to the health centers of the 67 towns and\nbarangays, Makinano told The Manila Bulletin on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is expected that the health centers can continuously\nprovide the services to the couples and individuals especially during\nthis national health crisis through quality, scientific, and safer\nmethods of family planning,\" he added.</p>\n\n<p>Population workers and volunteers of the local governments are\ngetting logistical support extended by POPCOM in the delivery of\nservices along the population program for years. POPCOM has been\nextending support to local health workers for three years now.</p>\n\n<p>POPCOM's support is also designed so that LGUs can be assisted\nin preventing untimely pregnancies during this crisis. Community workers\nand volunteers are getting material and financial support to equip young\npeople with appropriate knowledge and skills in postponing their\nfertility concerns.</p>\n\n<p>POPCOM is eyeing to expand its network to the academe, private\nsector, and youth leaders in molding responsible behavior among the\nyounger generation. In the study commissioned by POPCOM with the\n<org>University of the Philippines</org>, a significant proportion of young people\nare engaging in sexual activities which exposed themselves to the risky\ncomplications of teenage pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections,\nincluding HIV-AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>POPCOM had earlier launched its Responsible Parenthood-Family\nPlanning (RP-FP) Hotlines to assist the communities in educating the\npublic on matters involving their safety and health during the pandemic.\nTrained social workers of POPCOM will respond to the messages and calls\nfrom the public on 0995-1550746 (Globe) and 0951-0419159 (Smart) during\nworking hours Monday to Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Some of POPCOM's personnel shall be fielded to the LGUs to\nassist in the surveillance and contact tracing activities on COVID-19\ncases.</p>\n\n<p>In a joint memorandum with the DOH, POPCOM said that population\nworkers and volunteers, and other non-health personnel of the LGUs shall\nbe mobilized for contact tracing, Makinano said.</p>\n\n<p>DOH Secretary Francisco T. Duque III has re-certified all officials\nand employees of POPCOM nationwide as public health workers under the\nnational law for <org>Public Health Workers</org>.</p>\n\n<p>Duque said POPCOM is engaging in health and health-related works\nalong the national program on family planning.</p>\n\n<p>CAPTION(S):</p>\n\n<p>Photo courtesy of POPCOM 13 Caraga via Mike U.
