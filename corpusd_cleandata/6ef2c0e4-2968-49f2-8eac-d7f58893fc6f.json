Please help \u00a8them survive by\nputting \u00a8water out daily in a flat container (like a plastic flowerpot holder\nor old dinner plate or roasting dish) for drinking and bathing.\u00a8Also kitchen\nscraps, seed, breadcrumbs and so on will be gratefully received by birds\nstruggling to feed themselves and nestlings.\n\nHanging feeders containing sunflower hearts and suet fat balls will attract\ngoldfinches, sparrows, starlings and more.\u00a8If you are lucky enough to have\nvisiting hedgehogs, a little dog or cat food will be welcome in addition to\nwater.\u00a8Please help our wildlife survive this dry spell.\u00a8On a happy note, it's\nwonderful to see swifts returning to our skies, cuckoos calling in Broadland\nand even a lone heron feeding with swans on Wroxham bridge - must be the lack\nof holidaymakers in these current troubled times.\n\nEven waterbirds need a helping hand with bread and seed on occasion!\n\nJillian Hollis-Graves,\n\nCuttons Corner, Hemblington.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary aspects of the \"Cummings affair\" is the total\nlack of insight shown by his supporters in expecting the public to believe\ntheir hugely implausible justifications.\u00a8A senior bishop expressed this as\ntreating the public like mugs. For a bishop to make such a comment is\nunprecedented; but we are living in extraordinary times.\u00a8When will politicians\nrealise that you cannot defend the indefensible?\u00a8Loyalty will metamorphose\ninto stupidity and ultimately stupidity will not help their naked ambitions.\n\nC J Rumball,\n\nStrumpshaw.\n\nIn seeking to explain their somewhat ill-considered actions in the current\ncrisis those in authority are often using the word \"integrity\". Dominic\nCummings, according to the prime minister, acted with \"integrity\". Health\nMinisters claim that their policy towards care homes has been undertaken with\n\"integrity\".\u00a8Playing football behind closed doors at neutral stadiums is to\npreserve the sport's \"integrity\".\u00a8There now seems to be an interesting attempt\nto redefine the meaning of this word.\n\nJohn Bradford,\n\nRoseacre Close, Norwich.",

    "html": "<p>I am certainly no medical expert, but I am becoming ever more dismayed by the increasing acceptance amongst the public, that things will never be the same again, or acceptance of the &#8220;new normal&#8221;.&#168;I lived through the virulent <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hk\">Hong Kong</location> flu epidemic of 1969, which swept the world, and resulted in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">UK</location> having between 30,000 and 40,000 &#168;excess deaths, with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0318615332\">NHS</org> being put under extreme pressure.&#168;I do not recall hardly any alterations to daily life, with businesses, pubs, restaurants and sport carrying on more or less as normal. </p>\n<p>There was no &#8220;social distancing&#8221; or the wearing of hideous masks.&#168;The main difference was that we didn&#8217;t have the internet, social media, or 24 hours of scaremongering news &#168;channels, which has resulted in paranoia and fear, gripping this country.&#168;I have spoken to several &#168;people who are old enough to have experienced the 1969 epidemic, and without exception, they had all forgotten about it!&#168;This country needs to knuckle down to trying to get back to the &#8220;old normal&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Glyn D J Linder,</p>\n<p><person>Shirley Close</person>, Frettenham.</p>\n<p>Can I send out an appeal to fellow readers to put aside coronavirus and Cummings et al for a few minutes every day to help our garden wildlife?&#168;The continuing hot weather is causing the ground to be rock hard with little water and food around for wildbirds and hedgehogs. Please help &#168;them survive by putting &#168;water out daily in a flat container (like a plastic flowerpot holder or old dinner plate or roasting dish) for drinking and bathing.&#168;Also kitchen scraps, seed, breadcrumbs and so on will be gratefully received by birds struggling to feed themselves and nestlings. </p>\n<p>Hanging feeders containing sunflower hearts and suet fat balls will attract goldfinches, sparrows, starlings and more.&#168;If you are lucky enough to have visiting hedgehogs, a little dog or cat food will be welcome in addition to water.&#168;Please help our wildlife survive this dry spell.&#168;On a happy note, it&#8217;s wonderful to see swifts returning to our skies, cuckoos calling in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.brdlnd\">Broadland</location> and even a lone heron feeding with swans on Wroxham bridge &#8211; must be the lack of holidaymakers in these current troubled times. </p>\n<p>Even waterbirds need a helping hand with bread and seed on occasion!</p>\n<p><person>Jillian Hollis-Graves</person>,</p>\n<p>Cuttons Corner, Hemblington.</p>\n<p>One of the most extraordinary aspects of the &#8220;Cummings affair&#8221; is the total lack of insight shown by his supporters in expecting the public to believe their hugely implausible justifications.&#168;A senior bishop expressed this as treating the public like mugs. For a bishop to make such a comment is unprecedented; but we are living in extraordinary times.&#168;When will politicians realise that you cannot defend the indefensible?&#168;Loyalty will metamorphose into stupidity and ultimately stupidity will not help their naked ambitions.</p>\n<p><person>C J Rumball</person>,</p>\n<p>Strumpshaw.</p>\n<p>In seeking to explain their somewhat ill-considered actions in the current crisis those in authority are often using the word &#8220;integrity&#8221;. <person>Dominic Cummings</person>, according to the prime minister, acted with &#8220;integrity&#8221;. Health Ministers claim that their policy towards care homes has been undertaken with &#8220;integrity&#8221;.&#168;Playing football behind closed doors at neutral stadiums is to preserve the sport&#8217;s &#8220;integrity&#8221;.&#168;There now seems to be an interesting attempt to redefine the meaning of this word.</p>\n<p><person>John Bradford</person>,</p>\n<p>Roseacre Close, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/gb.eng.norwch\">Norwich</location>.</p>",
