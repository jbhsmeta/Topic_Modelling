    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at\nGastroenterology Daily News \\-- Investigators discuss new findings in Liver\nDiseases and Conditions - Liver Fibrosis. According to news reporting\noriginating in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated,\n\"Uric acid is associated with cardiometabolic risk factor and severity of\nliver damage. The mechanism of uric acid inducing liver damage is still\nelusive.\"\n\nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University Gadjah\nMada, \"This study elucidates the development of liver fibrosis under\nhyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia model was performed in male Swiss Webster mice.\nIntraperitoneally injection of uric acid (125mg/kg body weight) was done for 7\nand 14 days (UA7 and UA14 groups). Meanwhile, the UAL groups were injected\nwith uric acid and followed by the administration of allopurinol (UAL7 and\nUAL14 groups). On the due date, mice were sacrificed, and liver was harvested.\nUric acid, SGOT, SGPT, and albumin level were measured from the serum. The\nmRNA expression of TLR4, MCP1, CD68, and collagen1 were assessed through RT-\nPCR. Liver fibrosis was quantified through Sirius red staining, while the\nnumber of hepatic stellates cells (HSCs) and TLR4 were assessed through IHC\nstaining. Uric acid induction for 7 and 14 days stimulated an increase of both\nSGOT and SGPT serum levels. Followed by enhanced inflammatory mediators: Toll-\nlike receptor-4 (TLR-4), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) and\nCluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68) mRNA expression in the liver (p <0.05).\nThe histological findings showed that the UA7 and UA14 groups had higher liver\nfibrosis scores (p <0.05), collagen I mRNA expression (p <0.05), and the\nnumber of HSCs (p <0.05) compared to Control group. Administration of\nallopurinol showed amelioration of uric acid and liver enzymes levels which\nfollowed by inflammatory mediators, liver fibrosis and collagen1, and hepatic\nstellate cells significantly.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Therefore, uric acid\naugmented the liver fibrosis by increasing the number of hepatic stellate\ncells.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Uric acid induces liver fibrosis\nthrough activation of inflammatory mediators and proliferating hepatic\nstellate cell in mice. _The Medical Journal of Malaysia_ , 2020;75(Suppl\n1):14-18.\n\nOur news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting D.C.R. Sari, University Gadjah Mada, Public Health and Nursing,\nFaculty of Medicine, Dept. of Anatomy, Jl Farmako Sekip Utara, Yogyakarta,\nIndonesia. Additional authors for this research include A.S. Soetoko, A.S.\nSoetoko, M.M. Romi, U. Tranggono, W.AW. Setyaningsih and N. Arfian.\n\n(Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around\nthe world.)",

    "title": "New Findings on Liver Fibrosis from University Gadjah Mada Summarized (Uric acid induces liver fibrosis through activation of inflammatory mediators and proliferating hepatic stellate cell in mice): Liver Diseases and Conditions - Liver Fibrosis",
    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Gastroenterology Daily News</org> -- Investigators discuss new findings in Liver Diseases and Conditions - Liver Fibrosis. According to news reporting originating in Yogyakarta, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Uric acid is associated with cardiometabolic risk factor and severity of liver damage. The mechanism of uric acid inducing liver damage is still elusive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from University Gadjah Mada, &#8220;This study elucidates the development of liver fibrosis under hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia model was performed in male Swiss Webster mice. Intraperitoneally injection of uric acid (125mg/kg body weight) was done for 7 and 14 days (UA7 and UA14 groups). Meanwhile, the UAL groups were injected with uric acid and followed by the administration of allopurinol (UAL7 and UAL14 groups). On the due date, mice were sacrificed, and liver was harvested. Uric acid, SGOT, SGPT, and albumin level were measured from the serum. The mRNA expression of TLR4, MCP1, CD68, and collagen1 were assessed through RT-PCR. Liver fibrosis was quantified through Sirius red staining, while the number of hepatic stellates cells (HSCs) and TLR4 were assessed through IHC staining. Uric acid induction for 7 and 14 days stimulated an increase of both SGOT and SGPT serum levels. Followed by enhanced inflammatory mediators: Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) and Cluster of Differentiation 68 (CD68) mRNA expression in the liver (p &lt;0.05). The histological findings showed that the UA7 and UA14 groups had higher liver fibrosis scores (p &lt;0.05), collagen I mRNA expression (p &lt;0.05), and the number of HSCs (p &lt;0.05) compared to Control group. Administration of allopurinol showed amelioration of uric acid and liver enzymes levels which followed by inflammatory mediators, liver fibrosis and collagen1, and hepatic stellate cells significantly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;Therefore, uric acid augmented the liver fibrosis by increasing the number of hepatic stellate cells.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Uric acid induces liver fibrosis through activation of inflammatory mediators and proliferating hepatic stellate cell in mice. <em><org>The Medical Journal of Malaysia</org></em>, 2020;75(Suppl 1):14-18.</p>\n<p>Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>D.C.R.
