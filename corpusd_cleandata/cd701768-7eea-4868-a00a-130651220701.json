    "text": "In 1918, Max Steinberg arrived in Timmins from Montreal, looking to start a\nnew life. More than a century later, the German entrepreneur's imprint is\nstill going strong.\n\nUpon arriving in the city, Steinberg launched a men's apparel store, M.\nSteinberg & Company, before bringing on his friend, Joe Mahn, as a partner.\n\nToday, Steinberg & Mahn continues to offer up the latest in men's fashion.\n\n\"A lot of our ancestors came to Canada for opportunity, whether it be for\nmining, or lumber camps,\" said Darren Taylor, Steinberg's great-grandson and\nthe fourth generation of the family to run the shop.\n\n\"Like a lot of people, they came to sell clothes to the miners and people in\nthe lumber camps.\"\n\nAt the time the store opened, dress was more formal, with men wearing suits,\nties and hats on a daily basis.\n\nThat's evolved over the years to what Taylor describes as a very casual\napproach to dressing. Most men only wear suits and ties on formal occasions--\nweddings and funerals primarily.\n\nWhen Taylor took over operation of the store in the 1990s, baggy pants and big\nshoulder pads were the norm.\n\nNowadays, you're more likely to see men sport a slimmer, trimmer silhouette.\n\n\"I think menswear is alive right now,\" Taylor said. \"There's a lot of fashion\nin a casual-type world where you can wear a crazy shirt with a wonderful\njacket and finish it off with a nice, cotton pant or denim. This is what guys\nare looking for today.\"\n\nThe business has had its challenges, not the least of which was the arrival of\nbig box stores and, more recently, online shopping.\n\nBut Taylor believes the shop fills a niche with its hands-on customer service.\n\n\"A lot of people out there still want to be fussed and pampered over,\" he\nsaid. \"They want to feel; they want to touch; they want to feel important. You\ndon't get that sense of feeling important when you're buying online.\"\n\nIt's not uncommon for a client to come in at 5 p.m. with just two hours to\nspare to find something to wear for a formal event that evening.\n\nAfter serving many of the same clients--and generations of families \\--over\nseveral years, Taylor and his staff have developed personal relationships with\nmany of them, a unique exchange he believes is lost through online\ntransactions.\n\nHis shop focuses on high-quality apparel--well-made items that have classic\nappeal and will last for years.\n\nThat approach flies in the face of fast fashion, which encourages the purchase\nof cheap, quickly produced garments on a more regular basis. But with concerns\nmounting about the global environmental impact of large volumes of clothing\nbeing discarded, he believes that tide may be turning.\n\n\"You get what you pay for,\" Taylor said. \"If you buy something that's less\nexpensive, chances are you're going to wear it handful of times and shoot it\nin the garbage. If you would have bought it right the first time, you wouldn't\nhave to go back and forth a few times.\"\n\nAs in other industries, Taylor said it's been tough to retain top talent.\nPeople don't always want to make a career of working in a retail environment,\nand many are lured to mining by the promise of high salaries.\n\nBut the shop has been fortunate to maintain a small group of trusted employees\nover the years who have become extended family.\n\nTogether, they hope to carry on the Steinberg & Mahn name well into the next\ncentury.\n\n\"We're very, very proud and honoured for those that we've been able to serve\nover the last 100 years, whether it be from my great-grandfather, Max\nSteinberg, to my grandfather, Eli Steinberg, to my dad Don Taylor and myself,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"We're thrilled and honoured that we've been able to be part of people's lives\nand look after them and service them properly.\"\n\nLINDSAY KELLY\n\n[lindsay@nob.on.ca](mailto:lindsay@nob.on.ca)\n\nCaption: Darren Taylor is the fourth generation in his family to run Steinberg\n& Mahn, a men's apparel shop in Timmins.

    "title": "Century-old apparel shop continues to serve Timmins clientele: Steinberg & Mahn launched in 1919 after founder's migration from Montreal.(TIMMINS)",
    "html": "<p>In 1918, <person>Max Steinberg</person> arrived in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.timins\">Timmins</location> from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.qc.montrl\">Montreal</location>, looking to\nstart a new life. More than a century later, the German\nentrepreneur's imprint is still going strong.</p>\n\n<p>Upon arriving in the city, Steinberg launched a men's apparel\nstore, <org>M. Steinberg &amp; Company</org>, before bringing on his friend, <person>Joe\nMahn</person>, as a partner.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Steinberg &amp; Mahn continues to offer up the latest in\nmen's fashion.</p>\n\n<p>\"A lot of our ancestors came to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> for opportunity,\nwhether it be for mining, or lumber camps,\" said <person>Darren Taylor</person>,\nSteinberg's great-grandson and the fourth generation of the family\nto run the shop.</p>\n\n<p>\"Like a lot of people, they came to sell clothes to the miners\nand people in the lumber camps.\"</p>\n\n<p>At the time the store opened, dress was more formal, with men\nwearing suits, ties and hats on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>That's evolved over the years to what Taylor describes as a\nvery casual approach to dressing. Most men only wear suits and ties on\nformal occasions--weddings and funerals primarily.</p>\n\n<p>When Taylor took over operation of the store in the 1990s, baggy\npants and big shoulder pads were the norm.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, you're more likely to see men sport a slimmer,\ntrimmer silhouette.</p>\n\n<p>\"I think menswear is alive right now,\" Taylor said.\n\"There's a lot of fashion in a casual-type world where you can\nwear a crazy shirt with a wonderful jacket and finish it off with a\nnice, cotton pant or denim. This is what guys are looking for\ntoday.\"</p>\n\n<p>The business has had its challenges, not the least of which was the\narrival of big box stores and, more recently, online shopping.</p>\n\n<p>But Taylor believes the shop fills a niche with its hands-on\ncustomer service.</p>\n\n<p>\"A lot of people out there still want to be fussed and\npampered over,\" he said. \"They want to feel; they want to\ntouch; they want to feel important. You don't get that sense of\nfeeling important when you're buying online.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's not uncommon for a client to come in at <chron>5 p.m.</chron> with just\ntwo hours to spare to find something to wear for a formal event that\nevening.</p>\n\n<p>After serving many of the same clients--and generations of families\n--over several years, Taylor and his staff have developed personal\nrelationships with many of them, a unique exchange he believes is lost\nthrough online transactions.</p>\n\n<p>His shop focuses on high-quality apparel--well-made items that have\nclassic appeal and will last for years.</p>\n\n<p>That approach flies in the face of fast fashion, which encourages\nthe purchase of cheap, quickly produced garments on a more regular\nbasis. But with concerns mounting about the global environmental impact\nof large volumes of clothing being discarded, he believes that tide may\nbe turning.</p>\n\n<p>\"You get what you pay for,\" Taylor said. \"If you buy\nsomething that's less expensive, chances are you're going to\nwear it handful of times and shoot it in the garbage. If you would have\nbought it right the first time, you wouldn't have to go back and\nforth a few times.\"</p>\n\n<p>As in other industries, Taylor said it's been tough to retain\ntop talent. People don't always want to make a career of working in\na retail environment, and many are lured to mining by the promise of\nhigh salaries.</p>\n\n<p>But the shop has been fortunate to maintain a small group of\ntrusted employees over the years who have become extended family.</p>\n\n<p>Together, they hope to carry on the Steinberg &amp; Mahn name well\ninto the next century.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're very, very proud and honoured for those that\nwe've been able to serve over the last 100 years, whether it be\nfrom my great-grandfather, <person>Max Steinberg</person>, to my grandfather, <person>Eli\nSteinberg</person>, to my dad <person>Don Taylor</person> and myself,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're thrilled and honoured that we've been able to\nbe part of people's lives and look after them and service them\nproperly.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>LINDSAY KELLY</person></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:lindsay@nob.on.ca\">lindsay@nob.on.ca</a></p>\n\n<p>Caption: <person>Darren Taylor</person> is the fourth generation in his family to\nrun Steinberg &amp; Mahn, a men's apparel shop in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ca.on.timins\">Timmins</location>. <person>WAYNE\nSNIDER</person>/<a href=\"http://TIMMINSTODAY.COM\">TIMMINSTODAY.COM</a></p>",
