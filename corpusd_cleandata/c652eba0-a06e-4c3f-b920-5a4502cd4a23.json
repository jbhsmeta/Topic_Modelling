Unable to meet in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Troop members <person>Alicia Gushue</person> and <person>Lili Murphy</person> along with Scoutmaster <person>Jay Eibner</person> recreated the candlelight ceremony by recording each of their parts separately in front of a green screen. These videos were then merged with a photo of a campfire in the background. The final film was shown on Zoom and kicked off the ceremony that included the investiture of four new Scouts into the Troop. Each new Scout was presented with a Troop neckerchief at home by a parent. In addition, Murphy and Gushue were awarded second-class rank as well as robotics and composite materials merit badges. Gushue was also recognized for earning the Roman Catholic Ad <person>Altare Dei</person> award and presented with a uniform knot that signifies this accomplishment.</p>\n<p>- Submitted by <person>Lisa Y. Lester</person></p>",
