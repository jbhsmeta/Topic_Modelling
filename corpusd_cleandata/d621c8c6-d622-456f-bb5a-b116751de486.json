    "text": "To minimize health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cavaliers will not\nbe included in a 22-team restart plan the NBA will submit to the Board of\nGovernors today, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe format to resume was reported by Shams Charania of The Athletic and Adrian\nWojnarowski of ESPN in advance of today's 12:30 p.m. video conference. Three-\nfourths of the owners are required for approval and the plan is expected to\npass, Jeff Zillgitt of USA TODAY reported. The NBA Players Association must\nalso ratify it.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the league will bring together 13 Western Conference\nteams and nine from the Eastern Conference in Orlando, Florida, with all\nplaying eight regular season games to determine playoff seeds. That part of\nthe schedule will resemble an NCAA Tournament, with multiple games per day\nthrough the first round of the playoffs.\n\nAccording to reports, if the ninth seed is more than four games behind the\neighth, No. 8 makes the postseason, but fewer than four games would require a\nplay-in tournament. In case of a play-in, there would be a single elimination\nfor the ninth seed and a double elimination for the eighth seed, Zillgitt\nsaid.\n\nZillgitt reported that a 2\u00bd-week training camp at the ESPN Wide World of\nSports Complex just outside Orlando is being proposed before games resume.\n\nThose on the playoff bubble that will be included, according to reports, are\nthe Portland Trail Blazers (29-37), New Orleans Pelicans (28-36), Sacramento\nKings (28-36), San Antonio Spurs (27-36) and Phoenix Suns (26-39) in the West\nand the Washington Wizards (24-40) in the East. The Wizards are 5\u00bd games\nbehind the current eighth seeded Orlando Magic (30-35), and the Memphis\nGrizzlies (32-33) are No. 8 in the West.\n\nThe Cavs compiled a 5-6 record under coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who took over\nafter John Beilein stepped down, but they own the second-worst record in the\nleague (19-46).\n\nBickerstaff and several Cavs, including Kevin Love, Larry Nance Jr. and Collin\nSexton, have said during the pandemic they hoped their season wasn't over.\n\n\"With our guys in particular, any minute that we can get working with each\nother is beneficial to us,\" Bickerstaff said on May 6.\n\n\"Eleven games, it's not enough. We know we were heading in the right\ndirection.\"\n\nAccording to ESPN, play will begin on July 31, with Oct. 12 the last date for\na possible Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Athletic reported that the draft lottery and combine will be held in\nAugust.\n\nThe Cavs can select no lower than sixth and have a 14 percent chance of\ngetting the No. 1 pick.\n\nThe league suspended play on March 11 after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz\ntested positive for the virus; teammate Donovan Mitchell tested positive hours\nlater.\n\nAccording to Charania, the NBA is still debating several proposals to maintain\nsocial distancing, including not allowing players to shower at the arena,\nhaving them spread out in rows on the bench and prohibiting guests until the\nplayoffs.",

    "html": "<p>To minimize health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cavaliers will not be included in a 22-team restart plan the NBA will submit to the <org>Board of Governors</org> today, according to multiple reports.</p>\n<p>The format to resume was reported by <person>Shams Charania</person> of The Athletic and <person>Adrian Wojnarowski</person> of <org>ESPN</org> in advance of today's <chron>12:30 p.m.</chron> video conference. Three-fourths of the owners are required for approval and the plan is expected to pass, <person>Jeff Zillgitt</person> of <org>USA TODAY</org> reported. <org>The NBA Players Association</org> must also ratify it.</p>\n\n<p>According to Wojnarowski, the league will bring together 13 <org>Western Conference</org> teams and nine from the <org>Eastern Conference</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando, Florida</location>, with all playing eight regular season games to determine playoff seeds. That part of the schedule will resemble an <org>NCAA</org> Tournament, with multiple games per day through the first round of the playoffs.</p>\n\n<p>According to reports, if the ninth seed is more than four games behind the eighth, No. 8 makes the postseason, but fewer than four games would require a play-in tournament. In case of a play-in, there would be a single elimination for the ninth seed and a double elimination for the eighth seed, Zillgitt said.</p>\n\n<p>Zillgitt reported that a 2&#189;-week training camp at the <location>ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex</location> just outside <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.orlndo\">Orlando</location> is being proposed before games resume.</p>\n\n<p>Those on the playoff bubble that will be included, according to reports, are the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131363\">Portland Trail Blazers</org> (29-37), <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131370\">New Orleans Pelicans</org> (28-36), <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131377\">Sacramento Kings</org> (28-36), <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131372\">San Antonio Spurs</org> (27-36) and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131376\">Phoenix Suns</org> (26-39) in the West and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131366\">Washington Wizards</org> (24-40) in the East. The Wizards are 5&#189; games behind the current eighth seeded <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131404\">Orlando Magic</org> (30-35), and the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131374\">Memphis Grizzlies</org> (32-33) are No. 8 in the West.</p>\n\n<p>The Cavs compiled a 5-6 record under coach <person>J.B. Bickerstaff</person>, who took over after <person>John Beilein</person> stepped down, but they own the second-worst record in the league (19-46).</p>\n\n<p>Bickerstaff and several Cavs, including <person>Kevin Love</person>, <person>Larry Nance Jr</person>. and <person>Collin Sexton</person>, have said during the pandemic they hoped their season wasn't over.</p>\n\n<p>\"With our guys in particular, any minute that we can get working with each other is beneficial to us,\" Bickerstaff said on <chron>May 6</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Eleven games, it's not enough. We know we were heading in the right direction.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to <org>ESPN</org>, play will begin on <chron>July 31</chron>, with <chron>Oct. 12</chron> the last date for a possible Game 7 of the NBA Finals.</p>\n\n<p>The Athletic reported that the draft lottery and combine will be held in August.</p>\n\n<p>The Cavs can select no lower than sixth and have a 14 percent chance of getting the No. 1 pick.</p>\n\n<p>The league suspended play on <chron>March 11</chron> after <person>Rudy Gobert</person> of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131380\">Utah Jazz</org> tested positive for the virus; teammate <person>Donovan Mitchell</person> tested positive hours later.</p>\n\n<p>According to Charania, the NBA is still debating several proposals to maintain social distancing, including not allowing players to shower at the arena, having them spread out in rows on the bench and prohibiting guests until the playoffs.</p>",
