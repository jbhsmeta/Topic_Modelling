    "text": "TALLINN, Jun 05, BNS - The use of mobile internet and cable broadband services\ncontinued to be high in Estonia also after the end of the emergency situation,\nwhereas the use of voice calls dropped to the pre-crisis level, telecom\noperator Elisa said on Friday.\n\nToomas Poll, head of the technology unit at Elisa, said that during the crisis\nthe bigger consumption was spread evenly throughout the day, with bigger\nincreases registered in the time periods when consumption usually was lower.\n\n\"In the mobile communications network, internet use more than tripled in the\nfirst days and remained at a record high level until mid-April, when a minor\nreduction in use could be observed already. Use of the service continued to be\nsomewhat higher until the end of May due to the widespread use of remote work\nalso after the end of the emergency situation,\" Poll said.\n\nIn Elisa's cable network the use of data communication grew by almost half in\nthe first days, staying on that level until the beginning of April.\n\n\"In the cable network the use of volume increased foremost during the daytime,\nas people stayed at home, working and continuing to pursue their studies. In\nthe daily peak hours the increase in volume was smaller by about 15 percent,\nand despite the big increase the service was ensured for clients with the\npromised high quality,\" Polli said.\n\nIn addition, communication volumes grew in the Elisa network also when it\ncomes to uploads, which according to the company can be attributed to the\nconduct of video meetings.\n\nAt present, the workload of the cable network has returned to the pre-crisis\nlevel. In voice call services the average duration of calls dropped to the\npre-crisis level only at the end of May.\n\nIt appears from the voice call statistics of Elisa that the average duration\nof calls grew by 30 percent during the emergency situation and a call lasted\napproximately four minutes on the average.\n\nA leap in the numbers of calls made was registered following the declaration\nof the emergency situation, after which the numbers of calls returned to\nnormal.\n\nTallinn newsroom, +372 610 8821, [majandus@bns.ee](mailto:majandus@bns.ee)\n\nBaltic News Service",

Use of the service continued to be somewhat higher until the end of May due to the widespread use of remote work also after the end of the emergency situation,\" Poll said.</p>\n<p>In Elisa's cable network the use of data communication grew by almost half in the first days, staying on that level until the beginning of April.</p>\n<p>\"In the cable network the use of volume increased foremost during the daytime, as people stayed at home, working and continuing to pursue their studies. In the daily peak hours the increase in volume was smaller by about 15 percent, and despite the big increase the service was ensured for clients with the promised high quality,\" Polli said.</p>\n<p>In addition, communication volumes grew in the Elisa network also when it comes to uploads, which according to the company can be attributed to the conduct of video meetings.&#160;</p>\n<p>At present, the workload of the cable network has returned to the pre-crisis level. In voice call services the average duration of calls dropped to the pre-crisis level only at the end of May.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>It appears from the voice call statistics of Elisa that the average duration of calls grew by 30 percent during the emergency situation and a call lasted approximately four minutes on the average.&#160;</p>\n<p>A leap in the numbers of calls made was registered following the declaration of the emergency situation, after which the numbers of calls returned to normal.&#160; &#160;</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ee..tallin\">Tallinn</location> newsroom, +372 610 8821, <a href=\"mailto:majandus@bns.ee\">majandus@bns.ee</a></p>\n<p><org>Baltic News Service</org></p>",
