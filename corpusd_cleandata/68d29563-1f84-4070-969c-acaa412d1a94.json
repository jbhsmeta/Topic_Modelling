    "text": "TIP OF THE WEEK\n\nDoing laundry can be a drain on your wallet. Here are three easy ways to save\nenergy and money on laundry day, from [BobVila.com](http://BobVila.com):\n\n1\\. Get energy-efficient machines: If your washer and/or dryer is over 10\nyears old, it's time to replace it with an ENERGY STAR-certified machine,\nwhich uses about 20% less energy than a traditional machine. Additionally,\n\"today's high-tech heat pump dryers, which recirculate ambient air to maintain\ndryer temperature, can use 50% less energy than conventional models.\"\n\n2\\. Use cold water. Heating water represents about 90% of the energy consumed\nby washing machines. While good for removing grease stains, hot water is not\nrequired to clean normal dirt and sweat. Using cold water is also better for\nfabrics and less wrinkle-inducing.\n\n3\\. Reduce washing frequency. \"One key to a greener wash day is to do only\nfull loads, in other words, loads in which the tub is three-quarters full.\nENERGY STAR certified washers have a greater tub capacity, so you can clean\nthe same amount of laundry in fewer loads.\"\n\n4\\. Opt for sensor drying: If you have a modern dryer, switch from timed to\nsensor drying. \"Advanced moisture sensors on ENERGY STAR certified machines\nrecognize when laundry is perfectly dry, then shut off automatically.\" Also\nconsider selecting lower heat settings and clean the lint filter after every\nload to improve air circulation and efficiency.\n\nSPRING CLEANING\n\nDon't use paper towels to clean mirrors\n\nAlthough paper towels are great for cleaning countertops, their hyper\nabsorbency can soak up glass cleaner rapidly and leave streaks behind. Opt\ninstead for a microfiber cleaning cloth to wipe away the cleaner.\n\nGARDENING\n\nNew to gardening and don't know what to plant? The biggest factor to consider\nwhen selecting plants is what your family likes to eat. Here are the top 10\nplants recommended by the Old Farmer's Almanac that are both productive and\neasy to grow:\n\n1\\. Tomatoes\n\n2\\. Zucchini squash\n\n3\\. Peppers\n\n4\\. Cabbage\n\n5\\. Bush beans\n\n6\\. Lettuce\n\n7\\. Beets\n\n8\\. Carrots\n\n9\\. Chard\n\n10\\. Radishes\n\nThe old Farmer's Almanac also recommends marigolds to accompany the plants in\nyour garden for color and to keep pests away.\n\nDECORATING TIP\n\nReduce stress by clearing your countertops\n\nClutter and overcrowded countertops in your kitchen and bathrooms can create a\nstressful environment. According to Insider, storing away typical countertop\nitems can create a more peaceful space.\n\n\"Make sure everything is cleared off except for some usable yet decorative\nitems, such as your favorite cookbook, a fruit basket, and some greenery,\"\nsaid interior designer Bo Keuleers for Insider.\n\nFind places to store bulky items that don't need to be out all day, such as\npots and pans, toasters, and dish racks.",

    "html": "<p>TIP OF THE WEEK</p>\n<p>Doing laundry can be a drain on your wallet. Here are three easy ways to save energy and money on laundry day, from <a href=\"http://BobVila.com\">BobVila.com</a>:</p>\n\n<p>1. Get energy-efficient machines: If your washer and/or dryer is over 10 years old, it's time to replace it with an ENERGY STAR-certified machine, which uses about 20% less energy than a traditional machine. Additionally, \"today's high-tech heat pump dryers, which recirculate ambient air to maintain dryer temperature, can use 50% less energy than conventional models.\"</p>\n\n<p>2. Use cold water. Heating water represents about 90% of the energy consumed by washing machines. While good for removing grease stains, hot water is not required to clean normal dirt and sweat. Using cold water is also better for fabrics and less wrinkle-inducing.</p>\n\n<p>3. Reduce washing frequency. \"One key to a greener wash day is to do only full loads, in other words, loads in which the tub is three-quarters full. ENERGY STAR certified washers have a greater tub capacity, so you can clean the same amount of laundry in fewer loads.\"</p>\n\n<p>4. Opt for sensor drying: If you have a modern dryer, switch from timed to sensor drying. \"Advanced moisture sensors on ENERGY STAR certified machines recognize when laundry is perfectly dry, then shut off automatically.\" Also consider selecting lower heat settings and clean the lint filter after every load to improve air circulation and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>SPRING CLEANING</p>\n\n<p>Don't use paper towels to clean mirrors</p>\n\n<p>Although paper towels are great for cleaning countertops, their hyper absorbency can soak up glass cleaner rapidly and leave streaks behind. Opt instead for a microfiber cleaning cloth to wipe away the cleaner.</p>\n\n<p>GARDENING</p>\n\n<p>New to gardening and don't know what to plant? The biggest factor to consider when selecting plants is what your family likes to eat. Here are the top 10 plants recommended by the Old Farmer's Almanac that are both productive and easy to grow:</p>\n\n<p>1. Tomatoes</p>\n\n<p>2. Zucchini squash</p>\n\n<p>3. Peppers</p>\n\n<p>4. Cabbage</p>\n\n<p>5. Bush beans</p>\n\n<p>6. Lettuce</p>\n\n<p>7. Beets</p>\n\n<p>8. Carrots</p>\n\n<p>9. Chard</p>\n\n<p>10. Radishes</p>\n\n<p>The old Farmer's Almanac also recommends marigolds to accompany the plants in your garden for color and to keep pests away.</p>\n\n<p>DECORATING TIP</p>\n\n<p>Reduce stress by clearing your countertops</p>\n\n<p>Clutter and overcrowded countertops in your kitchen and bathrooms can create a stressful environment. According to Insider, storing away typical countertop items can create a more peaceful space.</p>\n\n<p>\"Make sure everything is cleared off except for some usable yet decorative items, such as your favorite cookbook, a fruit basket, and some greenery,\" said interior designer Bo Keuleers for Insider.</p>\n\n<p>Find places to store bulky items that don't need to be out all day, such as pots and pans, toasters, and dish racks.</p>",
