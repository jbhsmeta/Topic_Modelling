    "text": "FX Action: The Canadian dollar and other commodity- and oil-correlating\ncurrencies have remained underpinned amid the prevailing appetite for risk\nthat has been coursing through global markets. USD-CAD has remained heavy\nafter yesterday printing a three-month low at 1.3468. Reports that OPEC+ has\nratified an extension in prevailing quotas for an extra month is in the mix of\nsentiment-influencers today, although this is by now well anticipated. Front-\nmonth WTI crude prices have remained buoyant, but off yesterday's three-month\npeak at $38.18. Both the U.S. and Canada will release their May employment\nreports, with expected to paint a dismal picture, although with a markedly\ndiminished rate of job losses versus that seen during April's nadir. We don't\nanticipate the data having much impact on USD-CAD. Bigger picture, as long as\nthe nascent recovery isn't scuttled by a second wave of coronavirus\ninfections, oil price risk going forward would appear to be to the upside,\nwhich in turn should keep the Canadian dollar underpinned.",

USD-CAD has remained heavy after yesterday printing a three-month low at 1.3468. Reports that OPEC+ has ratified an extension in prevailing quotas for an extra month is in the mix of sentiment-influencers today, although this is by now well anticipated. Front-month WTI crude prices have remained buoyant, but off yesterday's three-month peak at <money>$38.18</money>. Both the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> will release their May employment reports, with expected to paint a dismal picture, although with a markedly diminished rate of job losses versus that seen during April's nadir. We don't anticipate the data having much impact on USD-CAD. Bigger picture, as long as the nascent recovery isn't scuttled by a second wave of coronavirus infections, oil price risk going forward would appear to be to the upside, which in turn should keep the Canadian dollar underpinned.</p>",
