She grew up in Gates County, North Carolina, where she attended\nGates County High School.\n\nShe worked as a veterinary assistant at the Gates County Animal Clinic, which\nshowed her love for animals. Tyler also competed in cheerleading at the\nNational Level. It was her passion. She also participated in numerous clubs\nand extracurricular activities. Tyler also attended and graduated from\nSouthampton County High School. She enjoyed working with disabled children and\ncompeted in the Miss Southampton High School Pageant. Tyler had a deep love\nfor the Lord and enjoyed learning all she could about her Heavenly Father. She\noften reached out to the underprivileged and those that felt alone.\n\nTyler is preceded in death by her paternal grandmother, Patricia Barnes\nJohnson.\n\nLeft to cherish Tyler's memory are her parents, Amy and Jason Barnes; her\nbeloved sister, Kristen Lane Barnes of Boykins; two brothers, Specialist\nBrandon Lee Griffin (U.S Army) of Fort Riley, Kansas, and Benjamin Matson of\nActon, Massachusetts; maternal grandparents, Charlie Buck and Vivian Turner of\nSevern, North Carolina; paternal grandfather, Stanley H. Barnes of Pendleton,\nNorth Carolina; special grandparents, John and Kathy Malaspina of Gates North\nCarolina.; a special aunt, Lisa Byrd (Davenport); cousin, Summer Temple of\nPetersburg; and an extensive host of other family and friends that adored her.\n\nTyler had a spirit that glowed as bright and pure as sunshine. That girl loved\nher momma with every fiber of her being. They had a relationship that was\nbeyond mother and daughter. Tyler's love of the Lord came from the teaching\nand example of her mother. Her personality, her beautiful smile and radiant\nlight that surrounded her departed this world much too early and will never be\nforgotten. Tyler had many friends that loved her, but her closest companion\nwas her sister Kristen. From the time Kristen was born, Tyler and Kristen\nshared an unbreakable bond.\n\nThe family would like to express our deepest appreciation for the outpouring\nof love shown for Tyler and for our family during this time of bereavement.\n\nThe visitation was on Monday, May 25, from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Barnes\nresidence, 33291 Pinecrest Drive, Boykins. The Barnes family will also receive\nvisitors at alternate times; please contact the family for further\ninformation.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.\n\nGod bless you!\n\n[www.wrightfuneralhome.org](http://www.wrightfuneralhome.org).",

She grew up in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.gates\">Gates County, North Carolina</location>, where she attended <org>Gates County High School</org>.</p>\n\n<p>She worked as a veterinary assistant at the <org>Gates County Animal Clinic</org>, which showed her love for animals. Tyler also competed in cheerleading at the National Level. It was her passion. She also participated in numerous clubs and extracurricular activities. Tyler also attended and graduated from <org>Southampton County High School</org>. She enjoyed working with disabled children and competed in the Miss Southampton High School Pageant. Tyler had a deep love for the Lord and enjoyed learning all she could about her Heavenly Father. She often reached out to the underprivileged and those that felt alone.</p>\n\n<p>Tyler is preceded in death by her paternal grandmother, <person>Patricia Barnes Johnson</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Left to cherish Tyler's memory are her parents, Amy and <person>Jason Barnes</person>; her beloved sister, <person>Kristen Lane Barnes</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.boyins\">Boykins</location>; two brothers, Specialist <person>Brandon Lee Griffin</person> (<org>U.S Army</org>) of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ks.forley\">Fort Riley, Kansas</location>, and <person>Benjamin Matson</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.acton\">Acton, Massachusetts</location>; maternal grandparents, <person>Charlie Buck</person> and <person>Vivian Turner</person> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.nc.severn\">Severn, North Carolina</location>; paternal grandfather, <person>Stanley H.

That girl loved her momma with every fiber of her being. They had a relationship that was beyond mother and daughter. Tyler's love of the Lord came from the teaching and example of her mother. Her personality, her beautiful smile and radiant light that surrounded her departed this world much too early and will never be forgotten. Tyler had many friends that loved her, but her closest companion was her sister Kristen. From the time Kristen was born, Tyler and Kristen shared an unbreakable bond.</p>\n\n<p>The family would like to express our deepest appreciation for the outpouring of love shown for Tyler and for our family during this time of bereavement.</p>\n\n<p>The visitation was on <chron>Monday, May 25</chron>, from <chron>5 to 8 p.m.</chron> at the Barnes residence, <location>33291 Pinecrest Drive</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.boyins\">Boykins</location>.
