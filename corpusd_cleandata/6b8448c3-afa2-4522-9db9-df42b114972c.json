    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Angiogenesis\nDaily \\-- Data detailed on bioinformatics have been presented. According to\nnews reporting originating from Wuhan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx\ncorrespondents, research stated, \"In addition to exploiting its ribonuclease\ncapacity, Ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) has been reported to exert anti-angiogenic\nand anti-tumorigenic effects in several tumors. However, the role of RNASET2\nin gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was\nto explore the expression, location, and clinical implications of RNASET2 in\nGAC.\"\n\nFinancial supporters for this research include National Natural Science\nFoundation of China.\n\nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Renmin Hospital of\nWuhan University: \"Data of RNASET2 mRNA expression in GAC and normal gastric\nmucosa tissues were extracted from three GSE series and 388 TCGA samples and\nreanalyzed. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 proliferation screening datasets were used\nto investigate cell growth changes after RNASET2 knockout in 19 GAC cell\nlines. The biological processes involved in RNASET2 were studied by the\nbioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the corresponding experiments including\nimmunohistochemical staining, clinicopathological features analysis, survival\ncurve, microvessel density detection, cell viability assay, and colony\nformation assay were performed to validate the expression and function of\nRNASET2 in GAC. An abundance of RNASET2 was present in the fundus glands and\npylorus glands of the normal gastric mucosa. RNASET2 mRNA and protein were\ndown-regulated in GAC compared with adjacent non-cancerous or normal gastric\nmucosa tissues. The expression of RNASET2 mRNA and protein in early GAC was\nhigher than that in advanced GAC. 79/134 gene sets involved in the early GAC\npathway were enriched in the RNASET2 mRNA high expression group. Genome-wide\nshRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 proliferation screening showed that knockdown or\nknockout of RNASET2 could not significantly promote GAC cell growth.\nAlamarBlue cell viability assay and colony formation assay in AGS cells\nfurther validated these results. Clinicopathologic features and survival\nanalysis demonstrated that RNASET2 protein was significantly correlated with\ntumor cell differentiation, Lauren's classification, and TM4SF1 protein\nexpression, but not correlated with lymph nodal metastasis and patient's\nprognosis. Microvessel density detection indicated that no significant\ncorrelation was found between the expression of RNASET2 protein and the\nangiogenesis of GAC.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Down-regulation of\nRNASET2 in GAC was only the consequence of the GAC, instead of the driver. The\nexpression of RNASET2 could be regarded as a good biomarker for identifying\nthe early stage of GAC.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Expression, Location, Clinical\nImplication, and Bioinformatics Analysis of RNASET2 in Gastric Adenocarcinoma.\n_Frontiers in Oncology_ , 2020,10.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Angiogenesis Daily</org> -- Data detailed on bioinformatics have been presented. According to news reporting originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..wuhan\">Wuhan</location>, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;In addition to exploiting its ribonuclease capacity, Ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) has been reported to exert anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic effects in several tumors. However, the role of RNASET2 in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the expression, location, and clinical implications of RNASET2 in GAC.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Financial supporters for this research include <org>National Natural Science Foundation</org> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.</p>\n<p>The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from <org>Renmin Hospital</org> of <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0802846189\">Wuhan University</org>: &#8220;Data of RNASET2 mRNA expression in GAC and normal gastric mucosa tissues were extracted from three GSE series and 388 TCGA samples and reanalyzed. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 proliferation screening datasets were used to investigate cell growth changes after RNASET2 knockout in 19 GAC cell lines. The biological processes involved in RNASET2 were studied by the bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the corresponding experiments including immunohistochemical staining, clinicopathological features analysis, survival curve, microvessel density detection, cell viability assay, and colony formation assay were performed to validate the expression and function of RNASET2 in GAC. An abundance of RNASET2 was present in the fundus glands and pylorus glands of the normal gastric mucosa. RNASET2 mRNA and protein were down-regulated in GAC compared with adjacent non-cancerous or normal gastric mucosa tissues. The expression of RNASET2 mRNA and protein in early GAC was higher than that in advanced GAC. 79/134 gene sets involved in the early GAC pathway were enriched in the RNASET2 mRNA high expression group. Genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 proliferation screening showed that knockdown or knockout of RNASET2 could not significantly promote GAC cell growth. AlamarBlue cell viability assay and colony formation assay in AGS cells further validated these results. Clinicopathologic features and survival analysis demonstrated that RNASET2 protein was significantly correlated with tumor cell differentiation, Lauren&#8217;s classification, and TM4SF1 protein expression, but not correlated with lymph nodal metastasis and patient&#8217;s prognosis. Microvessel density detection indicated that no significant correlation was found between the expression of RNASET2 protein and the angiogenesis of GAC.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Down-regulation of RNASET2 in GAC was only the consequence of the GAC, instead of the driver. The expression of RNASET2 could be regarded as a good biomarker for identifying the early stage of GAC.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Expression, Location, Clinical Implication, and Bioinformatics Analysis of RNASET2 in Gastric Adenocarcinoma. <em>Frontiers in Oncology</em>, 2020,10.
