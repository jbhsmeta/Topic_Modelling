Hearing celebrity couples from Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively to\nCiara and Russell Williams giving back makes my heart 10 times bigger.\n\nThat's why I'm happy to share the news that non-profit Power of 10 has\npartnered with Capital One to help give back to restaurants and fuel their\nrelief efforts. Over 30 local restaurants across the nation will benefit from\nthis collaboration as they feed frontline healthcare workers and other members\nin their community.\n\n\"Until we can gather in our favorite neighborhood restaurants again, we will\ncontinue coming together to support them by providing jobs for their employees\nand meals for their neighbors,\" says Washington, DC-based chef and\nrestaurateur Erik Bruner-Yang, who created The Power of 10.\n\nHow Power of 10 works is a restaurant receives $10,000 a week to employ 10\nfull-time staff members who make 1,000 meals for those in need. So far, to\ndate, over 20,000 meals have been given out. In times like, we all know a warm\nmeal made with love makes a big difference.\n\n\"Restaurants play a vital role in unifying the communities we serve, and we\nwere eager to do our part to help in this urgent and unprecedented time of\nneed,\" said Andy Navarrete, Head of External Affairs, Capital One Financial.\n\"We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Erik and The Power of 10 to\nsupport restaurants, bring restaurant workers back to work, and provide food\naccess to those on the frontlines of our country's fight against the COVID-19\npandemic.\"",
