    "text": "Businesses in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh began to clean up Sunday after\npeaceful protests over George Floyd's death turned into a night of destruction\nin the two cities and in others around the country.\n\nIn Philadelphia, business owners, workers and volunteers were sweeping up\nbroken glass and boarding up broken windows in blocks near Philadelphia's City\nHall even as people could still be seen emerging from broken-into stores\ncarrying bags.\n\nCrews were also cleaning up anti-police and other graffiti scrawled on the\nwalls of Philadelphia's City Hall.\n\nBoth cities implemented citywide curfews that were to be in effect Sunday\nnight as well. Gov. Tom Wolf signed a disaster emergency declaration\nauthorizing the adjutant general of the state National Guard and the\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner to activate personnel to help cities.\n\nIn Philadelphia, police said 100 people had been arrested as of early Sunday,\nincluding 43 for burglary and one for assault on a police officer. Police said\n13 officers were injured, including a bike officer whose leg was broken when\nhe was run over by suspect fleeing in a vehicle with stolen items from a\nbusiness.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, the public safety department said 43 adults and one juvenile\nwere arrested during the Saturday mayhem. Four police officers were injured\nbut all had been discharged from local hospitals.\n\nIn Harrisburg, Mayor Eric Papenfuse said two Capital Police officers were in\nthe hospital and several patrol cars were \"badly damaged by bricks.\" Police\nused pepper spray to disperse a crowd of protesters in the downtown area and a\n9 p.m. curfew was imposed in the city.\n\nSimilar protests, many of which began peacefully and turned violent late\nSaturday, have been happening throughout the country in response to Floyd's\ndeath. Floyd, who was Black, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police\nofficer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing.",
