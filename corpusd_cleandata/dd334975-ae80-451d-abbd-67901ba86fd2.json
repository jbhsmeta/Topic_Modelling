    "text": "Argo Group will pay $900,000 to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission investigation into executive perks paid to former CEO Mark Watson\nIII that raised the ire of an activist shareholder.\n\nAccording to the SEC, the settlement covers proxy statements for 2014 through\n2018, during which the Bermuda-based specialty insurer and reinsurer failed to\ndisclose more than $5.3 million it had paid for perks relating to Watson's\ncompensation. Those included \"personal use of a corporate aircraft, helicopter\ntrips and other personal travel, housing costs, transportation for family,\npersonal services, club memberships and tickets and transportation to\nentertainment events,\" the SEC said.\n\nDuring the period in question, Argo recorded $1.2 million in compensation for\nWatson, including retirement and financial planning benefits, the regulator\nsaid.\n\n\"Even after being made aware of potential inaccuracies in its disclosures\nrelated to executive compensation, Argo did not accurately and adequately\ninform shareholders about the perks and benefits it provided its highest-\nranking executive over a five-year period,\" Kelly Gibson, Director of the\nSEC's Philadelphia Regional Office, said in prepared remarks. \"We continue to\nfocus on whether companies are fully disclosing compensation paid to their top\nexecutives and have appropriate internal controls in place to ensure that\nshareholders receive information to which they are entitled.\"\n\nAccusations of excessive compensation for Watson first became public in\nFebruary 2019, after activist shareholder Voce Capital management LLC alleged\nexcessive spending for Watson's compensation. Watson and the company denied\nthe allegations. Argo disclosed in October 2019 that it had been subpoenaed by\nthe SEC about executive compensation, and that its independent directors would\nbe reviewing governance and compensation policies. Watson abruptly resigned in\nNovember 2019. Argo executive Kevin Rehnberg became interim CEO soon after,\nand become the company's official leader three months later.\n\nSince the pay scandal first surfaced, Argo has moved to address criticisms\nfrom Voce, and Rehnberg has said he is aiming for transparency and directness\nas he works to improve Argo's finances and refine its culture.\n\n**Source** : Securities and Exchange Commission",
