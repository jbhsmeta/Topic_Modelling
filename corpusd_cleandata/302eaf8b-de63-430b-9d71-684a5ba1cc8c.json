    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life\nScience Daily \\-- From Washington, D.C., NewsRx journalists report that a\npatent application by the inventors SUMMERSGILL, Philip (Redcar Cleveland,\nGB); ALLEN, Simon (Yarm Yorkshire, GB); RYAN, Timothy George (Middlesborough\nCleveland, GB); KILCAWLEY, Niamh Aine (Beaumont, Dublin, IE), filed on April\n16, 2018, was made available online on May 21, 2020.\n\nThe patent's assignee is Epigem Limited (Redcar Cleveland, United Kingdom).\n\nNews editors obtained the following quote from the background information\nsupplied by the inventors: \"Microfluidic devices are devices with very small\nfeatures, typically in the .mu.m range, which perform operations on very small\nfluid samples, typically in the .mu.l range. The small volume of fluid\nrequired for use with a microfluidic device offers benefits in fields such as\nmedicine, since only a very small blood sample is needed.\n\n\"One such application of microfluidic devices is described by Lei Li et al. in\n'A microfluidic platform for osmotic fragility test of red blood cells', RSC\nAdvances, 2012, 2, 7161-7165. Li describes the use of two syringe pumps to\npush a blood sample and pure water into a microfluidic device. The\nmicrofluidic device of Li consists of a Y junction at which the blood sample\nand pure water meet and form a laminar flow and a length of serpentine channel\nconsisting of 40 square-wave structures. The blood sample and pure water pass\nalong the channel and then exit the microfluidic device at a waste outlet. In\nthe device of Li, the fragility of red blood cells are tested along the length\nof the channel. An image capture device captures images of the blood sample at\nseveral places along the channel, and these images are analysed to determine\nan osmotic fragility curve from the number of blood cells present at each\nplace along the channel.\"\n\nAs a supplement to the background information on this patent application,\nNewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for\nthis patent application: \"In a first aspect of the present disclosure, a\nmicrofluidic test apparatus is provided, comprising a microfluidic device. The\nmicrofluidic device comprises a first reservoir for receiving a first fluid\ncontaining a sample of cells, a microfluidic test region, a first microfluidic\npathway provided between the microfluidic test region and the first reservoir;\na port. The microfluidic test apparatus further comprises a first pump\nconnected to the port and configured to pump a priming fluid into the port,\nand a second pump connected to the port and configured to apply suction at the\nport when operated. A controller is provided, which is configured to control\noperation of the first and second pumps, wherein the controller operates the\nfirst pump to prime the microfluidic device and operates the second pump to\ndraw a test volume from the first reservoir into the microfluidic test region.\n\n\"In a second aspect of the present disclosure, a microfluidic device is\nprovided, comprising a first reservoir for receiving a first fluid comprising\na sample of cells and a microfluidic test region. A first microfluidic pathway\nis provided between the microfluidic test region and the first reservoir.

The small volume of fluid required for use with a microfluidic device offers benefits in fields such as medicine, since only a very small blood sample is needed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One such application of microfluidic devices is described by <person>Lei Li</person> et al. in &#8216;A microfluidic platform for osmotic fragility test of red blood cells&#8217;, RSC Advances, 2012, 2, 7161-7165. Li describes the use of two syringe pumps to push a blood sample and pure water into a microfluidic device. The microfluidic device of Li consists of a Y junction at which the blood sample and pure water meet and form a laminar flow and a length of serpentine channel consisting of 40 square-wave structures. The blood sample and pure water pass along the channel and then exit the microfluidic device at a waste outlet. In the device of Li, the fragility of red blood cells are tested along the length of the channel. An image capture device captures images of the blood sample at several places along the channel, and these images are analysed to determine an osmotic fragility curve from the number of blood cells present at each place along the channel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, NewsRx correspondents also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;In a first aspect of the present disclosure, a microfluidic test apparatus is provided, comprising a microfluidic device.
