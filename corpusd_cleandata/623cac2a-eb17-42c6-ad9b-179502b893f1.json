    "text": "LITTLE ROCK \\- While planted acreage for winter wheat in Arkansas rebounded to\n160,000 acres in 2020 \u0096 up from 2019's record low of 110,000 acres \u0096 the\nstate's growers were still met with an unrelenting challenge, as intermittent\nrainfall throughout the year saturated fields.\n\nJason Kelley, wheat and feed grains agronomist for the University of Arkansas\nSystem Division of Agriculture, said opportunities to plant fall-planted wheat\nhave been scarce throughout the past several years.\n\n\"Wet weather is the number one contributing factor for the low wheat acreage\nfor the last two years in Arkansas and the Midsouth,\" Kelley said. \"Wet\nweather during September and October delays summer crop harvest, and when it\nis too wet to get crops out, wheat acreage is going to fall. In some areas of\nthe state, we literally had one to two days to plant wheat before the next\nrain.\"\n\nThree of Arkansas' four biggest crops \u0096 soybeans, rice and corn \u0096 saw\nincreased acreage in a recent prospective planting report from the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture. Cotton acres decreased, from about 620,000 acres in\n2019 to about 590,000 planned acres in 2020, a 5 percent drop.\n\nIn addition to narrowing the windows in which growers can actually plant the\ncrop, the wet weather makes management practices such as pest control more\ndifficult.\n\n\"Acreage that was planted has endured season-long wet conditions that reduced\nstands, prevented timely fertilizer and herbicide applications, and will\nlikely reduce the overall yield potential,\" Kelley said. \"Timing of spring\nnitrogen is critical to maximize yields. We often have our best wheat crops\nwhen we have a dry winter and spring.\"\n\nKelley added that making the best use of fields with adequate drainage was the\nmake-or-break factor for many growers hoping to maximize wheat yield\npotential.\n\nOne silver lining amongst the rain clouds for growers has been the rise in\ngrain market prices for wheat, especially compared to other commodities.\nGrowers have recently seen opportunities to book wheat for harvest at or near\n$6 per bushel, and cash prices are currently about $5.75 per bushel, which is\nthe highest it has been in about five years, with the exception of a brief\nperiod in August 2018.",

In some areas of the state, we literally had one to two days to plant wheat before the next rain.\"</p>\n\n<p>Three of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ar\">Arkansas'</location> four biggest crops &#150; soybeans, rice and corn &#150; saw increased acreage in a recent prospective planting report from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4053860838\">U.S. Department of Agriculture</org>. Cotton acres decreased, from about 620,000 acres in 2019 to about 590,000 planned acres in 2020, a 5 percent drop.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to narrowing the windows in which growers can actually plant the crop, the wet weather makes management practices such as pest control more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>\"Acreage that was planted has endured season-long wet conditions that reduced stands, prevented timely fertilizer and herbicide applications, and will likely reduce the overall yield potential,\" Kelley said. \"Timing of spring nitrogen is critical to maximize yields. We often have our best wheat crops when we have a dry winter and spring.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kelley added that making the best use of fields with adequate drainage was the make-or-break factor for many growers hoping to maximize wheat yield potential.</p>\n\n<p>One silver lining amongst the rain clouds for growers has been the rise in grain market prices for wheat, especially compared to other commodities. Growers have recently seen opportunities to book wheat for harvest at or near <money>$6</money> per bushel, and cash prices are currently about <money>$5.75</money> per bushel, which is the highest it has been in about five years, with the exception of a brief period in <chron>August 2018</chron>.</p>",
