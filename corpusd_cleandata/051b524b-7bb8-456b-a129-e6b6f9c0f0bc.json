    "text": "BY DAVID BILLER\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO \\- With Brazil emerging as one of the world's most infected\ncountries, President Jair Bolsonaro is deflecting all responsibility for the\ncoronavirus crisis, casting blame on mayors, governors, an outgoing health\nminister and the media.\n\nBy contrast, he portrays himself as a clear-eyed crusader willing to defend an\nunpopular idea - that shutting down the economy to control COVID-19 will\nultimately cause more suffering than allowing the disease to run its course.\nThe refusal of governors to fall into line with his decree allowing gyms to\nopen, he said, verged on authoritarianism.\n\nAsked about Brazil's death toll surpassing China's, he feigned impotence: \"I\ndon't work miracles. What do you want me to do?\" Confronted with a travel ban\nimposed on Brazil by the U.S. because of widespread COVID-19, one of his\nadvisers called it press hysteria.\n\nSince the outbreak started, the Brazilian leader has avoided acknowledging the\npotential effects of his actions, particularly in undermining local leaders'\nstay-at-home recommendations. A rare exception came in mid-April, as Bolsonaro\nappointed a new health minister tasked with sparing the economy from the\ncoronavirus.\n\n\"Reopening commerce is a risk I run because, if it (the virus) gets worse,\nthen it lands in my lap,\" he said.\n\nLess than two weeks later, as Brazil's death toll blew past 5,000, he told\nreporters, \"You're not going to put on my lap this count that isn't mine.\"\n\nAlmost a month on, the death toll in the country of 211 million has more than\nquadrupled, to 22,666, and continues to accelerate.\n\nThe Brazilian Supreme Court determined that states and cities have\njurisdiction to impose isolation measures. So Bolsonaro on May 7 walked\npurposefully across the capital's Three Powers Plaza to the top court, a tight\ncluster of ministers and business leaders in tow, and demanded local\nrestrictions be tempered.\n\n\"Some states went too far in their restrictive measures, and the consequences\nare knocking on our door,\" he said, adding that tens of millions of Brazilians\nhave lost their income. He has repeatedly singled out some local leaders by\nname.\n\nWhen governors defied Bolsonaro's subsequent decree that gyms, barbershops and\nbeauty salons be allowed to operate as essential services, he accused them of\nundermining the rule of law and suggested the move would invite \"undesirable\nauthoritarianism to emerge in Brazil.\"\n\nOn Saturday night, Bolsonaro ventured into the capital of Brasilia to lead by\nexample, this time eating a hot dog bought from a street vendor. Video he\nposted to Facebook showed supporters snapping selfies and calling him by his\nnickname - \"Myth!\" - while those in self-quarantine in overlooking apartments\nbanged pots and pans in protest.\n\nA May 17-18 poll by XP/Ipespe found 58% of those surveyed rated Bolsonaro's\npandemic response as bad or terrible, and only 21% as good or excellent.\nGovernors fared more than twice as well in both counts.\n\nThe poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.\n\nLatin America's largest nation has confirmed 363,000 COVID-19 cases, more than\nany nation except the U.S., and experts say that figure is a significant\nundercount due to insufficient testing. The strain on Brazil's underfunded\nhospitals has pushed them to the brink of collapse in multiple states and\nprevents some patients from getting treatment.\n\nHavoc and heartache are unfolding beneath a void of leadership, according to\nMiguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy\nStudies, which advises public health officials. Two health ministers have left\noffice during the pandemic, making Brazil the world's only nation that can\nclaim such distinction, he said.\n\nBrazil is \"completely incapable of dealing with and responding to this crisis\nas this crisis should be responded to - with complete leadership, clear\nmessages, political stability and unity,\" Lago said. \"That's not the case\nhere. Basically, what we're seeing is a complete lack of seriousness and\ncompetence.\"\n\nThe far-right leader fired his first health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta,\nfor supporting governors' restrictions. In his departing address, Mandetta\nreferred to Bolsonaro in what he later confirmed to magazine \u00c9poca was an\nallusion to the Albert Camus book \"The Plague.\" The novel about a diseased\ncity includes a passage that says those who did not believe in the plague were\nfirst to die because they took no precautions.\n\nBolsonaro's second minister, Nelson Teich, resigned about a month later after\nopenly disagreeing with Bolsonaro over chloroquine, the predecessor of the\nanti-malarial often touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as viable treatment.\nBolsonaro in his 17-month tenure has often expressed open admiration for Trump\nand the U.S.\n\nTrump would have to fire his government's top expert on the virus and the\nexpert's successor, attend anti-pandemic rallies and expand chloroquine\ntreatment \"to approach the level of crisis incompetence\" shown by Bolsonaro,\nIan Bremmer, the president of political consultancy Eurasia Group, said on\nTwitter this month.\n\nWeeks after praising chloroquine and directing the Army to ramp up production,\nBolsonaro admitted last week that there is no scientific evidence of its\neffectiveness, but said the nation is \"at war,\" and it is better to fight and\nlose than not fight at all. The country still has only an interim health\nminister: a general with no health experience whatsoever before April.\n\nIn the capital on Sunday, pro-Bolsonaro supporters staged a small\ndemonstration in front of the presidential palace, as they have for several\nweeks. Bolsonaro joined and once again lifted children in his arms.\n\nHe shared a video from a helicopter flyover of the demonstration that revealed\na sparsely occupied plaza. There were perhaps 1,000 people in attendance, in a\ncity of 3 million. One banner read \"Lockdowns kill more than the Chinese\nvirus!!!\"\n\nThat same day, Trump prohibited entry to the U.S. of foreigners coming from\nBrazil. Trump had already banned certain travelers from China, Europe, the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Iran. He has not moved to\nban travel from Russia, which has the world's third-highest number of\ninfections.\n\nBolsonaro's special adviser on international affairs, Filipe Martins, tweeted\nthat the ban was the natural result of Brazil's large population. \"There isn't\nanything specifically against Brazil. Ignore the hysteria from the press,\" he\nsaid. Bolsonaro shared Martins' comment on social media but has not commented\nhimself.\n\nUpon leaving the presidential residence Monday morning, Bolsonaro declined to\nanswer reporters' questions. One supporter grabbed his attention, and she\nbegged him to launch a \"massive propaganda\" campaign to improve his negative\nimage abroad.\n\n\"The global press is leftist,\" Bolsonaro explained coolly, then outstretched\nhis arm fully to point at journalists.\n\nAfter Bolsonaro got into his car, his supporters turned toward reporters,\nblasting them as \"trash\" and \"communists,\" making obscene gestures and\nthreats.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "html": "<p>BY <person>DAVID BILLER</person></p>\n<p><org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0174686754\">The Associated Press</org></p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/br..riodjn\">RIO DE JANEIRO</location> - With Brazil emerging as one of the world's most infected countries, President Jair Bolsonaro is deflecting all responsibility for the coronavirus crisis, casting blame on mayors, governors, an outgoing health minister and the media.</p>\n<p>By contrast, he portrays himself as a clear-eyed crusader willing to defend an unpopular idea - that shutting down the economy to control COVID-19 will ultimately cause more suffering than allowing the disease to run its course. The refusal of governors to fall into line with his decree allowing gyms to open, he said, verged on authoritarianism.</p>\n<p>Asked about <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil's</location> death toll surpassing <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China's</location>, he feigned impotence: \"I don't work miracles. What do you want me to do?\" Confronted with a travel ban imposed on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location> by the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> because of widespread COVID-19, one of his advisers called it press hysteria.</p>\n<p>Since the outbreak started, the Brazilian leader has avoided acknowledging the potential effects of his actions, particularly in undermining local leaders' stay-at-home recommendations. A rare exception came in mid-April, as Bolsonaro appointed a new health minister tasked with sparing the economy from the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>\"Reopening commerce is a risk I run because, if it (the virus) gets worse, then it lands in my lap,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Less than two weeks later, as <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil's</location> death toll blew past 5,000, he told reporters, \"You're not going to put on my lap this count that isn't mine.\"</p>\n<p>Almost a month on, the death toll in the country of 211 million has more than quadrupled, to 22,666, and continues to accelerate.</p>\n<p><org>The Brazilian Supreme Court</org> determined that states and cities have jurisdiction to impose isolation measures. So Bolsonaro on <chron>May 7</chron> walked purposefully across the capital's <location>Three Powers Plaza</location> to the top court, a tight cluster of ministers and business leaders in tow, and demanded local restrictions be tempered.</p>\n<p>\"Some states went too far in their restrictive measures, and the consequences are knocking on our door,\" he said, adding that tens of millions of Brazilians have lost their income. He has repeatedly singled out some local leaders by name.</p>\n<p>When governors defied Bolsonaro's subsequent decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons be allowed to operate as essential services, he accused them of undermining the rule of law and suggested the move would invite \"undesirable authoritarianism to emerge in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>.\"</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, Bolsonaro ventured into the capital of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/br..brsila\">Brasilia</location> to lead by example, this time eating a hot dog bought from a street vendor. Video he posted to Facebook showed supporters snapping selfies and calling him by his nickname - \"Myth!\" - while those in self-quarantine in overlooking apartments banged pots and pans in protest.</p>\n<p>A <chron>May 17-18</chron> poll by XP/Ipespe found 58% of those surveyed rated Bolsonaro's pandemic response as bad or terrible, and only 21% as good or excellent. Governors fared more than twice as well in both counts.</p>\n<p>The poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/cam\">Latin America's</location> largest nation has confirmed 363,000 COVID-19 cases, more than any nation except the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location>, and experts say that figure is a significant undercount due to insufficient testing. The strain on <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil's</location> underfunded hospitals has pushed them to the brink of collapse in multiple states and prevents some patients from getting treatment.</p>\n<p>Havoc and heartache are unfolding beneath a void of leadership, according to <person>Miguel Lago</person>, executive director of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil's</location> <org>Institute for Health Policy Studies</org>, which advises public health officials. Two health ministers have left office during the pandemic, making <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location> the world's only nation that can claim such distinction, he said.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location> is \"completely incapable of dealing with and responding to this crisis as this crisis should be responded to - with complete leadership, clear messages, political stability and unity,\" Lago said. \"That's not the case here. Basically, what we're seeing is a complete lack of seriousness and competence.\"</p>\n<p>The far-right leader fired his first health minister, <person>Luiz Henrique Mandetta</person>, for supporting governors' restrictions. In his departing address, Mandetta referred to Bolsonaro in what he later confirmed to magazine &#201;poca was an allusion to the Albert Camus book \"The Plague.\" The novel about a diseased city includes a passage that says those who did not believe in the plague were first to die because they took no precautions.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro's second minister, <person>Nelson Teich</person>, resigned about a month later after openly disagreeing with Bolsonaro over chloroquine, the predecessor of the anti-malarial often touted by <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> President <person>Donald Trump</person> as viable treatment. Bolsonaro in his 17-month tenure has often expressed open admiration for Trump and the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location></p>\n<p>Trump would have to fire his government's top expert on the virus and the expert's successor, attend anti-pandemic rallies and expand chloroquine treatment \"to approach the level of crisis incompetence\" shown by Bolsonaro, <person>Ian Bremmer</person>, the president of political consultancy <org>Eurasia Group</org>, said on Twitter this month.</p>\n<p>Weeks after praising chloroquine and directing the Army to ramp up production, Bolsonaro admitted last week that there is no scientific evidence of its effectiveness, but said the nation is \"at war,\" and it is better to fight and lose than not fight at all. The country still has only an interim health minister: a general with no health experience whatsoever before April.</p>\n<p>In the capital on Sunday, pro-Bolsonaro supporters staged a small demonstration in front of the presidential palace, as they have for several weeks. Bolsonaro joined and once again lifted children in his arms.</p>\n<p>He shared a video from a helicopter flyover of the demonstration that revealed a sparsely occupied plaza. There were perhaps 1,000 people in attendance, in a city of 3 million. One banner read \"Lockdowns kill more than the Chinese virus!!!\"</p>\n<p>That same day, Trump prohibited entry to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> of foreigners coming from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>. Trump had already banned certain travelers from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gb\">United Kingdom</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ie\">Ireland</location> and, to a lesser extent, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ir\">Iran</location>. He has not moved to ban travel from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ru\">Russia</location>, which has the world's third-highest number of infections.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro's special adviser on international affairs, <person>Filipe Martins</person>, tweeted that the ban was the natural result of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil's</location> large population. \"There isn't anything specifically against <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/br\">Brazil</location>. Ignore the hysteria from the press,\" he said. Bolsonaro shared Martins' comment on social media but has not commented himself.</p>\n<p>Upon leaving the presidential residence Monday morning, Bolsonaro declined to answer reporters' questions. One supporter grabbed his attention, and she begged him to launch a \"massive propaganda\" campaign to improve his negative image abroad.</p>\n<p>\"The global press is leftist,\" Bolsonaro explained coolly, then outstretched his arm fully to point at journalists.</p>\n<p>After Bolsonaro got into his car, his supporters turned toward reporters, blasting them as \"trash\" and \"communists,\" making obscene gestures and threats.</p>\n<p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
