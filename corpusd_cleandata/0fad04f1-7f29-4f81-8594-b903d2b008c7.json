    "text": "SATURDAY, JUNE 6\n\nIt's OK to focus on yourself for a change. If there is something you want to\naccomplish, get the ball rolling. Make your dreams a priority. Set the record\nstraight when dealing with people who take you for granted or try to\nmanipulate you. Your greatest gain will come from doing what makes you happy.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Communication will help alleviate\nmisunderstandings. Be direct, and expect the same in return. Don't share\nsecrets or passwords if someone is vague or prying. Plan something special for\nsomeone you love. Romance will enhance your personal life.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): An opportunity will intrigue you. Get the facts and\nlook at logistics first. Clear up a pending problem before you start something\nnew. You can be aggressive as long as you leave nothing to chance and have a\nclear passageway.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): If you do the legwork, a positive change will take\nplace. Altering the way you live and how you handle your money will set you on\na path that leads to freedom. Discuss plans and intentions with someone you\nlove.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Verify information before passing it along. Emotions\nwill flare up if you mislead someone. Put more energy into creative endeavors\nthat you enjoy, and invest more time in figuring out how you want to spend the\nrest of your life.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Shop online for something you've been eyeing for a long\ntime. Scope the internet for the best price or markdowns that will help you\nmake your purchase sooner than anticipated. Physical improvements will fetch\ncompliments and boost your ego. Romance is on the rise.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Be honest but sensitive about something you don't\nlike if you want to turn a negative into a positive. Taking on too much will\nleave you exhausted and weaken your immune system. Pace yourself, and be\nrealistic when offering help to others.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Explore new possibilities. By starting a new course\nor hobby, you will be able to incorporate what you learn into your routine.\nSpend more time on fitness and improving the way you present yourself to the\nvirtual world. Romance is favored.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Broaden your horizon, explore creative\nopportunities and express your feelings regarding the lifestyle you are\nliving. Compromise will help you get on the same page as someone close to you.\nYou don't have to overspend to have a good time.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Brace yourself; you'll encounter an emotional\nsituation if you let someone put demands on you. Keep your secrets, passwords\nand private life to yourself. Make a personal improvement that helps build\nconfidence. Romance is in the stars.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Don't let uncertainty set in when you should be\nmaking a decision and moving forward. Recognize when someone is using\nemotional tactics to get a rise out of you or to pressure you into doing\nthings you don't want to do.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Set a personal goal, and make the necessary\nchanges. Follow your heart and trust in yourself, not someone eager to turn\nyou into a follower. Personal and domestic improvements will help you gain\ncontrol. Strive for peace and equality.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Think twice before you make a move. If you let\nemotions get in the way, you will end up in an argument. It's up to you to\nstop others from using or manipulating you.",

    "html": "<p> <chron>SATURDAY, JUNE 6</chron> </p><p>It&#8217;s OK to focus on yourself for a change. If there is something you want to accomplish, get the ball rolling. Make your dreams a priority. Set the record straight when dealing with people who take you for granted or try to manipulate you. Your greatest gain will come from doing what makes you happy. </p><p>ARIES (<chron>March 21-April 19</chron>): Communication will help alleviate misunderstandings. Be direct, and expect the same in return. Don&#8217;t share secrets or passwords if someone is vague or prying. Plan something special for someone you love. Romance will enhance your personal life. </p><p>TAURUS (<chron>April 20-May 20</chron>): An opportunity will intrigue you. Get the facts and look at logistics first. Clear up a pending problem before you start something new. You can be aggressive as long as you leave nothing to chance and have a clear passageway. </p><p>GEMINI (<chron>May 21-June 20</chron>): If you do the legwork, a positive change will take place. Altering the way you live and how you handle your money will set you on a path that leads to freedom. Discuss plans and intentions with someone you love. </p><p>CANCER (<chron>June 21-July 22</chron>): Verify information before passing it along. Emotions will flare up if you mislead someone. Put more energy into creative endeavors that you enjoy, and invest more time in figuring out how you want to spend the rest of your life. </p><p>LEO (<chron>July 23-Aug. 22</chron>): Shop online for something you&#8217;ve been eyeing for a long time. Scope the internet for the best price or markdowns that will help you make your purchase sooner than anticipated. Physical improvements will fetch compliments and boost your ego. Romance is on the rise. </p><p>VIRGO (<chron>Aug. 23-Sept. 22</chron>): Be honest but sensitive about something you don&#8217;t like if you want to turn a negative into a positive. Taking on too much will leave you exhausted and weaken your immune system. Pace yourself, and be realistic when offering help to others. </p><p>LIBRA (<chron>Sept. 23-Oct. 22</chron>): Explore new possibilities. By starting a new course or hobby, you will be able to incorporate what you learn into your routine. Spend more time on fitness and improving the way you present yourself to the virtual world. Romance is favored. </p><p>SCORPIO (<chron>Oct. 23-Nov. 21</chron>): Broaden your horizon, explore creative opportunities and express your feelings regarding the lifestyle you are living. Compromise will help you get on the same page as someone close to you. You don&#8217;t have to overspend to have a good time. </p><p>SAGITTARIUS (<chron>Nov. 22-Dec. 21</chron>): Brace yourself; you&#8217;ll encounter an emotional situation if you let someone put demands on you. Keep your secrets, passwords and private life to yourself. Make a personal improvement that helps build confidence. Romance is in the stars. </p><p>CAPRICORN (<chron>Dec. 22-Jan. 19</chron>): Don&#8217;t let uncertainty set in when you should be making a decision and moving forward. Recognize when someone is using emotional tactics to get a rise out of you or to pressure you into doing things you don&#8217;t want to do. </p><p>AQUARIUS (<chron>Jan. 20-Feb. 18</chron>): Set a personal goal, and make the necessary changes. Follow your heart and trust in yourself, not someone eager to turn you into a follower. Personal and domestic improvements will help you gain control. Strive for peace and equality. </p><p>PISCES (<chron>Feb. 19-March 20</chron>): Think twice before you make a move. If you let emotions get in the way, you will end up in an argument. It&#8217;s up to you to stop others from using or manipulating you. </p><p />",
