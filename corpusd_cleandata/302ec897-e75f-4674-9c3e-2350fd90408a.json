    "text": "We would like to thank Stereophile for a fantastic review of our new Skylight\n2-way monitor. Robert Schryer clearly understood the genesis of this\nloudspeaker and its many performance-related virtues, all the while using a\nwide bandwidth of musical genres, including many recordings that we at Totem\nAcoustic are very familiar with.\n\nThe Sklyight encompasses 33 years of innovative and successful loudspeaker\ndesign, the end result being an honest musical \"storyteller.\" We strongly\nrecommend that they be positioned between 1 and 2 feet from the wall behind\nthem whenever possible to achieve bass response accurately down to the\nmid-40's Hz range.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind is that the Sklylights are still a relative\nbargain in the high-performance audio world.\n\nTotem would also like to extend its appreciation to John Atkinson for his time\nand effort with regards to the objectively detailed measurements. We would\nlike to emphasize that when the Skylights are placed straight ahead and\nmeasured between 5 and 8 degrees off-axis, they will yield even better\nresults, especially in the upper registers between 7kHz and 10kHz, where any\ndips will disappear, resulting in a much more linear response.\n\nWe believe that a great product deserves a great story; this review achieves\nthat goal. Thank you again to Stereophile for what can surely be considered a\n\"Class A\" product review.\n\nVince Bruzzese, Chief Designer\n\nTotem Acoustic",

    "html": "<p>We would like to thank Stereophile for a fantastic review of our\nnew Skylight 2-way monitor. <person>Robert Schryer</person> clearly understood the\ngenesis of this loudspeaker and its many performance-related virtues,\nall the while using a wide bandwidth of musical genres, including many\nrecordings that we at Totem Acoustic are very familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>The Sklyight encompasses 33 years of innovative and successful\nloudspeaker design, the end result being an honest musical\n\"storyteller.\" We strongly recommend that they be positioned\nbetween 1 and 2 feet from the wall behind them whenever possible to\nachieve bass response accurately down to the mid-40's Hz range.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind is that the Sklylights are still a\nrelative bargain in the high-performance audio world.</p>\n\n<p>Totem would also like to extend its appreciation to <person>John Atkinson</person>\nfor his time and effort with regards to the objectively detailed\nmeasurements. We would like to emphasize that when the Skylights are\nplaced straight ahead and measured between 5 and 8 degrees off-axis,\nthey will yield even better results, especially in the upper registers\nbetween 7kHz and 10kHz, where any dips will disappear, resulting in a\nmuch more linear response.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that a great product deserves a great story; this review\nachieves that goal. Thank you again to Stereophile for what can surely\nbe considered a \"Class A\" product review.</p>\n\n<p><person>Vince Bruzzese</person>, Chief Designer</p>\n\n<p>Totem Acoustic</p>",
