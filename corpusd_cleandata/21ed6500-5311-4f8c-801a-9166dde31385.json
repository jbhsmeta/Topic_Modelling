    "text": "When the century ago leaders of Kenosha County made plans to build a new\ncourthouse they aimed to create something that would be a focus of community\npride.\n\nThe Kenosha County Courthouse was built from 1923 to 1925, with the county\nborrowing $500,000 for its construction and hiring the Milwaukee architectural\nfirm of Lindl, Lesse and Schutte.\n\nFrank Martinellli, the engineering project manager for Kenosha County's\nDivision of Facilities, said the total cost to build the structure nearly 100\nyears ago was $1 million.\n\nThe building design followed the neoclassical theme local leaders wanted for\nthe buildings surrounding Civic Center Park.\n\nDuring construction the architectural firm hired master craftsmen artists and\nmural artists, including well-known artists A.E. Foringer and William De\nLeftwich-Dodge who did murals for the Library of Congress and the World's\nColumbian Exposition in Chicago, to paint original murals for the building.\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin Historical Society, the courthouse was \"recognized\nthroughout the state at the time of its construction as an eloquent testament\nto the City Beautiful movement and heralded by national planning authorities\nas an inspiration to other small cities.\"\n\nRay Arbet, county director of public works, said he sees the courtroom as\nworth preserving and restoring.\n\n\"In my mind one of the most significant pieces of our community history is\nthat courtroom, and if there is any way to restore it I hope we can,\" he said.\n\nThe building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\n\"They built a building that could stand the test of time,\" Martinelli said.\n\"They really spent the time and money and effort to do something befitting a\ncourthouse and how important it was to the community.\"\n\nAlthough the exterior of the building is largely unchanged and the lobby,\nwhich soars three stories to a stained glass skylight, the marble staircases\nand hallways with their original light fixtures have largely been preserved,\npast renovations have changed much of the rest of the interior.\n\nThe ceremonial courtroom was once matched by a second courtroom across the\nhall that also had a skylight and ornate plasterwork. In a past renovation,\nthat courtroom was sliced in half horizontally with a second courtroom added\nabove the first, that second courtroom accessed from the third floor.\n\nThe skylight and plasterwork in that courtroom were destroyed. A mural from\nthat courtroom was found years later rolled up in a basement. It was restored\nand now hangs in the boardroom at the Kenosha County Administration Building.\n\n\"That's another facet to the story,\" Martinelli said. \"We've already lost half\nof what were really artistic, original courtrooms, so this is the only thing\nwe have left.\"\n\nMartinelli said the first step in determining whether the ceiling and skylight\ncould be restored was to find out whether the air conditioning system could be\nmoved into the attic. He said they found that could be done.\n\nNow craftsmen are trying to figure out whether it is possible to repair the\ndamage to the plaster and the stained glass, and exactly how much it would\ncost.\n\n\"On the skylight they had poured some kind of cement-like mixture on top of\nthe glass to make it stiffer so it could support the dropped ceiling,\"\nMartinelli said. \"The architect couldn't find another example of where that\nhad occurred and been restored.\"\n\nExperts are working to see if cement can be removed.\n\n\"They will test techniques. If they find it's not even possible then we will\nknow we would have to replace the glass. But because it's on the National\nRegister, you really have to try to save the original or prove that it was not\npossible to save,\" Martinelli said.\n\nAnother question, Martinelli said, is if the plaster is restored would the\nornate paintwork on the ceiling be something that could be matched or would\nthe entire ceiling need to be repainted.\n\nOnce the current project to determine costs is complete, Martinelli said, the\nCounty Board would have to approve moving forward with a restoration.\n\nBecause it is expected to be expensive, Martinelli said the idea is that any\nrestoration would be funded through a mix of county facilities funding and\nfundraising through grants and donations.\n\n\"We know that the likelihood is that this project will not be done without a\nsignificant amount of private contribution, and it's going to be difficult to\nmake that happen,\" Arbet said.\n\nBut he said he is hopeful that with the restoration study and bids complete,\nthe county will be able to find grants and benefactors that can help bring the\nrestoration to fruition.\n\nIN PHOTOS: Boundless Adventures zipline and aerial park in Bristol Woods\nParkBoundless Adventures zipline and aerial park in Bristol Woods Park will\nopen Saturday under guidelines established with help from the Kenosha County\nDivision of Health, owner Lorrie Funtleyder said.

    "html": "<p>When the century ago leaders of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.kensha\">Kenosha County</location> made plans to build a new courthouse they aimed to create something that would be a focus of community pride.</p>\n<p><location>The Kenosha County Courthouse</location> was built from 1923 to 1925, with the county borrowing <money>$500,000</money> for its construction and hiring the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location> architectural firm of Lindl, Lesse and Schutte.</p>\n\n<p>Frank Martinellli, the engineering project manager for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.kensha\">Kenosha County's</location> <org>Division of Facilities</org>, said the total cost to build the structure nearly 100 years ago was <money>$1 million</money>.</p>\n\n<p>The building design followed the neoclassical theme local leaders wanted for the buildings surrounding <location>Civic Center Park</location>.</p>\n\n<p>During construction the architectural firm hired master craftsmen artists and mural artists, including well-known artists <person>A.E. Foringer</person> and <person>William De Leftwich-Dodge</person> who did murals for the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0257495329\">Library of Congress</org> and the <org>World's Columbian Exposition</org> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location>, to paint original murals for the building.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <org>Wisconsin Historical Society</org>, the courthouse was \"recognized throughout the state at the time of its construction as an eloquent testament to the City Beautiful movement and heralded by national planning authorities as an inspiration to other small cities.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Ray Arbet</person>, county director of public works, said he sees the courtroom as worth preserving and restoring.</p>\n\n<p>\"In my mind one of the most significant pieces of our community history is that courtroom, and if there is any way to restore it I hope we can,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>The building was added to the <org>National Register of Historic Places</org> in 1982.</p>\n\n<p>\"They built a building that could stand the test of time,\" Martinelli said. \"They really spent the time and money and effort to do something befitting a courthouse and how important it was to the community.\"</p>\n\n<p>Although the exterior of the building is largely unchanged and the lobby, which soars three stories to a stained glass skylight, the marble staircases and hallways with their original light fixtures have largely been preserved, past renovations have changed much of the rest of the interior.</p>\n\n<p>The ceremonial courtroom was once matched by a second courtroom across the hall that also had a skylight and ornate plasterwork. In a past renovation, that courtroom was sliced in half horizontally with a second courtroom added above the first, that second courtroom accessed from the third floor.</p>\n\n<p>The skylight and plasterwork in that courtroom were destroyed. A mural from that courtroom was found years later rolled up in a basement. It was restored and now hangs in the boardroom at the <location>Kenosha County Administration Building</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"That's another facet to the story,\" Martinelli said. \"We've already lost half of what were really artistic, original courtrooms, so this is the only thing we have left.\"</p>\n\n<p>Martinelli said the first step in determining whether the ceiling and skylight could be restored was to find out whether the air conditioning system could be moved into the attic. He said they found that could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Now craftsmen are trying to figure out whether it is possible to repair the damage to the plaster and the stained glass, and exactly how much it would cost.</p>\n\n<p>\"On the skylight they had poured some kind of cement-like mixture on top of the glass to make it stiffer so it could support the dropped ceiling,\" Martinelli said. \"The architect couldn't find another example of where that had occurred and been restored.\"</p>\n\n<p>Experts are working to see if cement can be removed.</p>\n\n<p>\"They will test techniques. If they find it's not even possible then we will know we would have to replace the glass. But because it's on the <org>National Register</org>, you really have to try to save the original or prove that it was not possible to save,\" Martinelli said.</p>\n\n<p>Another question, Martinelli said, is if the plaster is restored would the ornate paintwork on the ceiling be something that could be matched or would the entire ceiling need to be repainted.</p>\n\n<p>Once the current project to determine costs is complete, Martinelli said, the <org>County Board</org> would have to approve moving forward with a restoration.</p>\n\n<p>Because it is expected to be expensive, Martinelli said the idea is that any restoration would be funded through a mix of county facilities funding and fundraising through grants and donations.</p>\n\n<p>\"We know that the likelihood is that this project will not be done without a significant amount of private contribution, and it's going to be difficult to make that happen,\" Arbet said.</p>\n\n<p>But he said he is hopeful that with the restoration study and bids complete, the county will be able to find grants and benefactors that can help bring the restoration to fruition.</p>\n\n<p>IN PHOTOS: Boundless Adventures zipline and aerial park in Bristol Woods ParkBoundless Adventures zipline and aerial park in <location>Bristol Woods Park</location> will open Saturday under guidelines established with help from the <org>Kenosha County Division of Health</org>, owner <person>Lorrie Funtleyder</person> said.
