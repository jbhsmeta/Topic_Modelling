    "text": "The George Floyd March in Wausau on Saturday, June 6, was the city's third\nprotest in a week. Some 1,500 protesters marched on downtown city streets,\nchanting for an end to police brutality. Outside City Hall, they knelt\nsilently for 8 minutes, 46 seconds to commemorate the death of George Floyd,\nallegedly killed by a Minneapolis police officer who put his knee on Floyd's\nneck for that long.\n\nThe protest, held in the city of 40,000 people, wasn't so different from those\nheld across the country since Floyd's death. But it was the biggest organized\npolitical demonstration in Wausau in decades.\n\nIts size is one measure of how broad and far-reaching the protest movement\nagainst police brutality and racial injustice has become - reaching\nWisconsin's small cities and rural areas, and often attracted hundreds or even\nthousands of participants there.\n\n\"It's thrilling,\" said Carmyn Hoen, one of the organizers of the Wausau event.\n\"This has been everywhere. You see it even in small towns that you wouldn't\nthink would have protests. ... Everyone's coming together.\"\n\nThe protests are calls for racial justice, and for some people of color in\nrural areas, they're also a way to assert their right to belong in those\nplaces.\n\n\"Being part of a minority community, you don't always feel the numbers in\nsmall communities,\" said Gwen Taylor, another organizer of the march. \"It's\njust as important if not even more important for the small communities to come\nout together, for people to come out of the woodwork and see that our\ncommunity is diverse, and we have strength in that diversity.\"\n\nWausau's event was among the largest Wisconsin has seen outside of Madison and\nMilwaukee. But other events have dotted Wisconsin's rural landscape. In Door\nCounty, hundreds lined the streets of Sturgeon Bay on Thursday, carrying signs\nand chanting. In Shawano, a group of 300 people marched down Main Street on\nWednesday. The list goes on: Protesters outside the courthouse in Merrill \\-\npopulation 9,000 - held signs saying, \"End police brutality\" and \"His name was\nGeorge Floyd.\" There have been demonstrations in Marinette, Marshfield,\nStevens Point, Menomonie, and many others.\n\n\"Regardless of how small we are, we are always going to support and advocate\nfor people of color and (against) injustices anywhere,\" said Felysity Niles,\n19, whose sign at the Wausau rally said, \"Hmong Americans for Black Lives.\"\nAbout 12% of Wausau's population is Hmong, and it's the largest minority\ngroup.\n\n\"Sometimes, smaller communities get a bad rap, that we are more inclined to be\ndiscriminatory,\" said Kayley McColley, 20, also an organizer of the Wausau\nmarch. \"Here we can see there are black people, there are Hmong people, there\nare people of other ethnicities and backgrounds who are here and who need our\nsupport.\"\n\nRural protesters feel connected to nationwide movement\n\nOn Saturday, Ellen Lafans drove about a half an hour south from her home in\nCable to a demonstration in Hayward, where she met other protesters from\nSawyer and Bayfield counties at the intersection they've come to call\n\"Democracy Corner.\"\n\nLafans, who is white, is a retired nurse. She and her husband moved to\nnorthern Wisconsin three years ago from the Twin Cities, where decades ago she\nhad an apartment near the site where Floyd was killed. She said she imagined\nthat she was moving to the woods to get away from it all. Instead, she has\nbecome steadily more politically engaged.\n\nAbout 60 people participated in the demonstration in Hayward, which has a\npopulation of 2,300. Lafans said she feels a connection to the much larger\nprotests.\n\n\"There's many of us all over who feel like we need to link our arms together\nand do something,\" she said.\n\nIn central Wisconsin, Caitlin Schulz attended her first-ever demonstration in\nWausau at the end of May. Schulz has gone to three more since then: in\nMarshfield (where she lives), in Stevens Point, and in Wausau again.\n\nSchulz, 31, works part-time in retail, but she lost a full-time job as an\nevent planner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She is candid about the fact that\nher life circumstances now give her time and the ability to participate in\nprotests that she didn't have before. She said she's also been moved by the\nexperience of getting involved.\n\n\"I tear up and I might cry a little bit, and I get goosebumps when people are\nhonking\" to show their support for protesters, she said. \"You feel like you're\ndoing something important.\"\n\nA sense of connection to a nationwide movement is part of what protesters in\nrural areas say they get out of it. But that isn't to say they aren't seeking\nto address concrete issues in their own communities. McColley and Hoen both\nsaid they have been deeply saddened and outraged by the death of George Floyd.\nBoth have faced discrimination in their own lives and in their own community,\nand have made calls for change.\n\n\"Right now, we're sad,\" Hoen said. \"We want to use that sadness and that\nscared feeling to make our community a better place.\"\n\n'All 50 states are protesting'\n\nAt a protest in Superior on Thursday, Clivia Prince, 21, said she worries\nabout her safety and the safety of her younger brother as people of color in\nthe mostly white city. But community support for the protests has helped her,\nshe said. She feels like \"they do care that we're people.\"\n\n\"All 50 states are protesting,\" Prince said. \"They want justice for our\npeople.  It makes me happy. It's not just black people supporting Black Lives\nMatter.\"\n\nEphraim Nikoi is a member of Superior's police and fire commission. At the\ncity's protest, the Ghana-born communications professor said he hopes small\ncities will be a model.\n\n\"A city like Superior can show the nation how to bring people together,\" Nikoi\nsaid. \"We see how peaceful it is. We see how engaged the people are.  This is\nan example we could share with other communities around the country.\"\n\nIndeed, small cities haven't generally seen the vandalism or violent clashes\nbetween police and protesters that marked at least the early days of protests\nin large cities.\n\nIn Wausau, organizers worked with local police to organize the march, which\nclosed downtown streets on Saturday morning and into early afternoon. Police\nprovided water for protesters, and several knelt during the silent observance.\n\nOrganizers called the event a beginning of a movement that is still growing.\nAnd like many, they also expressed surprise at just how widespread the protest\nmovement has become in not even two weeks.\n\n\"Although I am saddened by the reason that we have all been moved to\ncongregate here this morning,\" McColley told the crowd on Saturday before the\nmarch, \"I think I speak for all the organizers when I say that we feel\nuplifted, we feel empowered, and we are shocked in the best of ways to see the\nnumber of people here with us today.\"\n\nEditor's note: Danielle Kaeding contributed reporting from Superior.\n\nWisconsin Public Radio, (C) Copyright 2020, Board of Regents of the University\nof Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.",

    "title": "At small-town protests, organizers see 'thrilling' signs of change",
    "html": "<p>The George Floyd March in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> on <chron>Saturday, June 6</chron>, was the city's third protest in a week. Some 1,500 protesters marched on downtown city streets, chanting for an end to police brutality. <location>Outside City Hall</location>, they knelt silently for 8 minutes, 46 seconds to commemorate the death of <person>George Floyd</person>, allegedly killed by a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer who put his knee on Floyd's neck for that long.</p>\n<p>The protest, held in the city of 40,000 people, wasn't so different from those held across the country since Floyd's death. But it was the biggest organized political demonstration in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> in decades.</p>\n\n<p>Its size is one measure of how broad and far-reaching the protest movement against police brutality and racial injustice has become - reaching <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin's</location> small cities and rural areas, and often attracted hundreds or even thousands of participants there.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's thrilling,\" said <person>Carmyn Hoen</person>, one of the organizers of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> event. \"This has been everywhere. You see it even in small towns that you wouldn't think would have protests. ... Everyone's coming together.\"</p>\n\n<p>The protests are calls for racial justice, and for some people of color in rural areas, they're also a way to assert their right to belong in those places.</p>\n\n<p>\"Being part of a minority community, you don't always feel the numbers in small communities,\" said <person>Gwen Taylor</person>, another organizer of the march. \"It's just as important if not even more important for the small communities to come out together, for people to come out of the woodwork and see that our community is diverse, and we have strength in that diversity.\"</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau's</location> event was among the largest <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> has seen outside of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.madisn\">Madison</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location>. But other events have dotted <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin's</location> rural landscape. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.door\">Door County</location>, hundreds lined the streets of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.stubay\">Sturgeon Bay</location> on Thursday, carrying signs and chanting. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.shaano\">Shawano</location>, a group of 300 people marched down <location>Main Street</location> on Wednesday. The list goes on: Protesters outside the courthouse in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.merill\">Merrill</location> - population 9,000 - held signs saying, \"End police brutality\" and \"His name was <person>George Floyd</person>.\" There have been demonstrations in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.martte\">Marinette</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.mareld\">Marshfield</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.steint\">Stevens Point</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.mennie\">Menomonie</location>, and many others.</p>\n\n<p>\"Regardless of how small we are, we are always going to support and advocate for people of color and (against) injustices anywhere,\" said Felysity Niles, 19, whose sign at the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> rally said, \"Hmong Americans for Black Lives.\" About 12% of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau's</location> population is Hmong, and it's the largest minority group.</p>\n\n<p>\"Sometimes, smaller communities get a bad rap, that we are more inclined to be discriminatory,\" said <person>Kayley McColley</person>, 20, also an organizer of the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> march. \"Here we can see there are black people, there are Hmong people, there are people of other ethnicities and backgrounds who are here and who need our support.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rural protesters feel connected to nationwide movement</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday, <person>Ellen Lafans</person> drove about a half an hour south from her home in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.cable\">Cable</location> to a demonstration in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.hayard\">Hayward</location>, where she met other protesters from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.sawyer\">Sawyer</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.bayeld\">Bayfield</location> counties at the intersection they've come to call \"Democracy Corner.\"</p>\n\n<p>Lafans, who is white, is a retired nurse. She and her husband moved to northern <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> three years ago from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.stpaul\">the Twin Cities</location>, where decades ago she had an apartment near the site where Floyd was killed. She said she imagined that she was moving to the woods to get away from it all. Instead, she has become steadily more politically engaged.</p>\n\n<p>About 60 people participated in the demonstration in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.hayard\">Hayward</location>, which has a population of 2,300. Lafans said she feels a connection to the much larger protests.</p>\n\n<p>\"There's many of us all over who feel like we need to link our arms together and do something,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>In central <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location>, <person>Caitlin Schulz</person> attended her first-ever demonstration in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> at the end of May. Schulz has gone to three more since then: in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.mareld\">Marshfield</location> (where she lives), in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.steint\">Stevens Point</location>, and in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location> again.</p>\n\n<p>Schulz, 31, works part-time in retail, but she lost a full-time job as an event planner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She is candid about the fact that her life circumstances now give her time and the ability to participate in protests that she didn't have before. She said she's also been moved by the experience of getting involved.</p>\n\n<p>\"I tear up and I might cry a little bit, and I get goosebumps when people are honking\" to show their support for protesters, she said. \"You feel like you're doing something important.\"</p>\n\n<p>A sense of connection to a nationwide movement is part of what protesters in rural areas say they get out of it. But that isn't to say they aren't seeking to address concrete issues in their own communities. McColley and Hoen both said they have been deeply saddened and outraged by the death of <person>George Floyd</person>. Both have faced discrimination in their own lives and in their own community, and have made calls for change.</p>\n\n<p>\"Right now, we're sad,\" Hoen said. \"We want to use that sadness and that scared feeling to make our community a better place.\"</p>\n\n<p>'All 50 states are protesting'</p>\n\n<p>At a protest in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.supior\">Superior</location> on Thursday, <person>Clivia Prince</person>, 21, said she worries about her safety and the safety of her younger brother as people of color in the mostly white city. But community support for the protests has helped her, she said. She feels like \"they do care that we're people.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"All 50 states are protesting,\" <person>Prince</person> said. \"They want justice for our people. &#133; It makes me happy. It's not just black people supporting <org>Black Lives Matter</org>.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Ephraim Nikoi</person> is a member of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.supior\">Superior's</location> police and fire commission. At the city's protest, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/gh\">Ghana</location>-born communications professor said he hopes small cities will be a model.</p>\n\n<p>\"A city like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.supior\">Superior</location> can show the nation how to bring people together,\" Nikoi said. \"We see how peaceful it is. We see how engaged the people are. &#133; This is an example we could share with other communities around the country.\"</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, small cities haven't generally seen the vandalism or violent clashes between police and protesters that marked at least the early days of protests in large cities.</p>\n\n<p>In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.wausau\">Wausau</location>, organizers worked with local police to organize the march, which closed downtown streets on Saturday morning and into early afternoon. Police provided water for protesters, and several knelt during the silent observance.</p>\n\n<p>Organizers called the event a beginning of a movement that is still growing. And like many, they also expressed surprise at just how widespread the protest movement has become in not even two weeks.</p>\n\n<p>\"Although I am saddened by the reason that we have all been moved to congregate here this morning,\" McColley told the crowd on Saturday before the march, \"I think I speak for all the organizers when I say that we feel uplifted, we feel empowered, and we are shocked in the best of ways to see the number of people here with us today.\"</p>\n\n<p>Editor's note: <person>Danielle Kaeding</person> contributed reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.supior\">Superior</location>.</p>\n\n<p><org>Wisconsin Public Radio</org>, &#169; Copyright 2020, Board of Regents of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2716590029\">University of Wisconsin System</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4103425290\">Wisconsin Educational Communications Board</org>.</p>",
