    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Food Daily\nNews \\-- A patent application by the inventor Kent, Joseph (Kent, WA), filed\non November 7, 2019, was made available online on May 21, 2020, according to\nnews reporting originating from Washington, D.C., by NewsRx correspondents.\n\nThis patent application is assigned to Progressive International Corporation\n(Kent, Washington, United States).\n\nThe following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background\ninformation supplied by the inventors: \"It can be useful to have a manually-\noperated food processor for various chopping or mixing jobs in food\npreparation. In many cases, a relatively small version of such a food\nprocessor is convenient, consuming little space and providing a tool\nappropriately sized for a fresh-made batch of salsa or similar chopped or\nmixed food items.\n\n\"In some cases, it can be especially useful to have the ability to adjust the\nspeed of a rotary blade in such a chopping device. Some existing chopping\ndevices have internal gearing to allow a drive shaft to rotate faster than the\nrotational speed of the hand crank, but they fail to provide the ability to\noperate the drive shaft at multiple selected gearing ratios.\"\n\nIn addition to the background information obtained for this patent\napplication, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventor's summary\ninformation for this patent application: \"A preferred version of the present\ninvention includes a hand-crank operated food processor having a container\nwith a removeable lid. The lid incorporates a number of gears that are\noperable by the hand crank to cause a drive shaft to spin, imparting a\nrotational force to a food processing implement such as a blade or a paddle\ncarried on the drive shaft. Most preferably, the crank can be inserted into\nany one of a plurality of attachment points such that rotation of the crank\nhandle in a selected attachment point will rotate the gears, and therefore the\ndrive shaft, at a different rotational speed as compared to the rotational\nspeed achieved at a different one of the plurality of attachment points at the\nsame input speed from the crank.\n\n\"In one version, the food processor includes a container having a base and a\nsidewall extending upwardly from the base to a rim, the container defining an\ninterior space. A lid is removably attachable to the container to enclose the\ninterior space, the lid having an upper portion and a lower portion combining\nto form a housing, the lower portion facing toward the interior space when the\nlid is attached to the container. A first gear coupler is positioned on the\nupper portion of the lid, with a second gear coupler positioned on the upper\nportion of the lid. A crank is removably attachable to a selected one of the\nfirst gear coupler or the second gear coupler. At least one food processing\ntool is carried on a drive shaft, the drive shaft being attachable to the\nlower portion of the lid. A plurality of gears is mounted within the housing\nand engaged between the first gear coupler and the drive shaft and between the\nsecond gear coupler and the drive shaft. When the crank is attached to the\nfirst gear coupler and rotates the first gear coupler at a first rotational\nspeed the plurality of gears causes the drive shaft to rotate at a first drive\nshaft rotational speed, and when the crank is attached to the second gear\ncoupler and rotates the second gear coupler at the first rotational speed the\nplurality of gears causes the drive shaft to rotate at a second drive shaft\nrotational speed, the second drive shaft rotational speed being greater than\nthe first drive shaft rotational speed.\n\n\"In some versions, a raised gear box is formed in the housing, the plurality\nof gears being positioned within the gear box.\n\n\"In a preferred version, the plurality of gears further comprises a first\ndrive gear mounted for common rotation with the first gear coupler, a first\ntransmission gear enmeshed with the first drive gear, a driving gear axially\nmounted for common rotation with the first transmission gear, and a driven\ngear enmeshed with the driving gear, the driven gear being connected to the\ndrive shaft, whereby rotating the first gear coupler causes rotation of the\nfirst drive gear, the first transmission gear, the driving gear, the driven\ngear, and the drive shaft.\n\n\"Most preferably, the plurality of gears further comprises a second drive gear\nmounted for common rotation with the second gear coupler, a second\ntransmission gear enmeshed with the second drive gear, the driving gear\nfurther being axially mounted for common rotation with the second transmission\ngear, whereby rotating the second gear coupler causes rotation of the second\ndrive gear, the second transmission gear, the driving gear, the driven gear,\nand the drive shaft.\n\n\"In some versions, the driven gear is connected to the drive shaft for common\nrotation about an axis defined by the drive shaft.\n\n\"In a preferred example, the second rotational speed is at least twice as\ngreat as the first rotational speed.\n\n\"Preferably, a drive post is axially connected to the driven gear, the drive\nshaft being removably attachable to the drive post. The drive post may further\ncomprise an internal drive post portion positioned within the housing and an\nexternal drive post portion extending outside the lower housing portion.\n\n\"Preferably, the external drive post portion terminates in a keyed portion\nconfigured for attachment to a mating keyed cavity of the drive shaft.\n\n\"In some versions, the upper portion of the container comprises an undulating\nseat, and wherein the lower portion of the lid comprises a mating undulating\nsurface.\n\n\"A version of the invention includes a food processor with a container having\na base and a sidewall extending upwardly from the base to a container rim, the\ncontainer defining an interior space. The container has a plurality of\ncontainer undulations spaced along an upper portion of the container. A lid is\nremovably attachable to the container to enclose the interior space.\n\n\"At least one food processing tool is carried on a drive shaft, the drive\nshaft being attachable to the lid and defining a central axis of the container\nwhen the lid is attached to the container and the drive shaft is attached to\nthe lid. The lid further has a plurality of lid undulations, the plurality of\nlid undulations being sized and positioned to be complementary to and\nengageable with the plurality of container undulations when the lid is\nattached to the container, wherein the lid undulations and the container\nundulations interact with one another to prevent the lid from rotating with\nrespect to the container, and further wherein the lid undulations and the\ncontainer undulations are disengageable with one another by movement of the\nlid along the central axis and without rotation of the lid.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\.

In many cases, a relatively small version of such a food processor is convenient, consuming little space and providing a tool appropriately sized for a fresh-made batch of salsa or similar chopped or mixed food items.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some cases, it can be especially useful to have the ability to adjust the speed of a rotary blade in such a chopping device. Some existing chopping devices have internal gearing to allow a drive shaft to rotate faster than the rotational speed of the hand crank, but they fail to provide the ability to operate the drive shaft at multiple selected gearing ratios.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventor&#8217;s summary information for this patent application: &#8220;A preferred version of the present invention includes a hand-crank operated food processor having a container with a removeable lid. The lid incorporates a number of gears that are operable by the hand crank to cause a drive shaft to spin, imparting a rotational force to a food processing implement such as a blade or a paddle carried on the drive shaft. Most preferably, the crank can be inserted into any one of a plurality of attachment points such that rotation of the crank handle in a selected attachment point will rotate the gears, and therefore the drive shaft, at a different rotational speed as compared to the rotational speed achieved at a different one of the plurality of attachment points at the same input speed from the crank.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In one version, the food processor includes a container having a base and a sidewall extending upwardly from the base to a rim, the container defining an interior space. A lid is removably attachable to the container to enclose the interior space, the lid having an upper portion and a lower portion combining to form a housing, the lower portion facing toward the interior space when the lid is attached to the container. A first gear coupler is positioned on the upper portion of the lid, with a second gear coupler positioned on the upper portion of the lid. A crank is removably attachable to a selected one of the first gear coupler or the second gear coupler. At least one food processing tool is carried on a drive shaft, the drive shaft being attachable to the lower portion of the lid. A plurality of gears is mounted within the housing and engaged between the first gear coupler and the drive shaft and between the second gear coupler and the drive shaft. When the crank is attached to the first gear coupler and rotates the first gear coupler at a first rotational speed the plurality of gears causes the drive shaft to rotate at a first drive shaft rotational speed, and when the crank is attached to the second gear coupler and rotates the second gear coupler at the first rotational speed the plurality of gears causes the drive shaft to rotate at a second drive shaft rotational speed, the second drive shaft rotational speed being greater than the first drive shaft rotational speed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some versions, a raised gear box is formed in the housing, the plurality of gears being positioned within the gear box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a preferred version, the plurality of gears further comprises a first drive gear mounted for common rotation with the first gear coupler, a first transmission gear enmeshed with the first drive gear, a driving gear axially mounted for common rotation with the first transmission gear, and a driven gear enmeshed with the driving gear, the driven gear being connected to the drive shaft, whereby rotating the first gear coupler causes rotation of the first drive gear, the first transmission gear, the driving gear, the driven gear, and the drive shaft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most preferably, the plurality of gears further comprises a second drive gear mounted for common rotation with the second gear coupler, a second transmission gear enmeshed with the second drive gear, the driving gear further being axially mounted for common rotation with the second transmission gear, whereby rotating the second gear coupler causes rotation of the second drive gear, the second transmission gear, the driving gear, the driven gear, and the drive shaft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some versions, the driven gear is connected to the drive shaft for common rotation about an axis defined by the drive shaft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a preferred example, the second rotational speed is at least twice as great as the first rotational speed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Preferably, a drive post is axially connected to the driven gear, the drive shaft being removably attachable to the drive post. The drive post may further comprise an internal drive post portion positioned within the housing and an external drive post portion extending outside the lower housing portion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Preferably, the external drive post portion terminates in a keyed portion configured for attachment to a mating keyed cavity of the drive shaft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some versions, the upper portion of the container comprises an undulating seat, and wherein the lower portion of the lid comprises a mating undulating surface.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A version of the invention includes a food processor with a container having a base and a sidewall extending upwardly from the base to a container rim, the container defining an interior space. The container has a plurality of container undulations spaced along an upper portion of the container. A lid is removably attachable to the container to enclose the interior space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At least one food processing tool is carried on a drive shaft, the drive shaft being attachable to the lid and defining a central axis of the container when the lid is attached to the container and the drive shaft is attached to the lid. The lid further has a plurality of lid undulations, the plurality of lid undulations being sized and positioned to be complementary to and engageable with the plurality of container undulations when the lid is attached to the container, wherein the lid undulations and the container undulations interact with one another to prevent the lid from rotating with respect to the container, and further wherein the lid undulations and the container undulations are disengageable with one another by movement of the lid along the central axis and without rotation of the lid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
