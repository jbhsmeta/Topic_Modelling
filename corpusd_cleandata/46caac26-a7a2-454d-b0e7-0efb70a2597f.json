    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Robotics &\nMachine Learning Daily News Daily News \\-- A patent application by the\ninventors Holtz, Alex (Jacksonville, FL); Matics, Scott Raymond (Jacksonville,\nFL); Oisel, Lionel (La Nouaye, FR), filed on November 25, 2019, was made\navailable online on May 21, 2020, according to news reporting originating from\nWashington, D.C., by NewsRx correspondents.\n\nThis patent application is assigned to GVBB Holdings S.A.R.L. (Luxembourg,\nLuxembourg).\n\nThe following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background\ninformation supplied by the inventors: \"Live production of a television\nprogram such as a news show often requires one or more television cameras to\ncapture the image of different 'on-air' talent, such as a news anchor, weather\nreporter and/or sports reporter. In the past, a camera operator would manually\noperate each television camera. Such manual operation often entailed moving\nthe camera to different positions within a television studio to make sure that\nthe particular on-air talent appeared in the center of the camera's field of\nview. During broadcasting, the on-air talent often will make slight lateral\nmovements, forcing the camera operator to displace the camera by a\ncorresponding amount to maintain the on-air talent within the center of the\ncamera's field of view. The camera operator will generally observe the image\nof the on-air talent in the camera's view finder so the operator will have\nimmediate knowledge of the movement of the talent and move the camera\naccordingly.\n\n\"Advances in technology have led to the development of robotic television\ncameras, such as the 'Cameraman', available from Thomson Grass Valley,\nJacksonville, Fla. Such robotic cameras operate under the control of one or\nmore computers which manage functions such as camera displacement along the x,\ny, and z axes, pan, tilt, zoom and focus. By appropriately programming the\ncomputer(s), the camera will operate automatically, thus obviating the need\nfor manual control. Typical robotic cameras have the ability to move from a\nknown home position to one or more pre-set positions, each pre-set position\nenabling a particular camera shot of an on-air talent. Generally, the pre-set\ncamera positions remain static. In other words, if the on-air talent moves\neven slightly to the right or left while the robotic camera remains static,\nthen the on-air talent will appear off-center within the field of view of the\ncamera.\n\n\"To overcome this difficulty, robotic cameras can include automatic tracking\ntechnology such as such the tracking system described in U.S. Pat. No.\n5,668,629 issued in the name of Jeffrey Parker et al. The automatic tracking\nsystem described in the '629 patent employs a Infra-Red (BR) transmitter\ncarried by the moving object (e.g., the on-air talent) for transmitting\nsignals to an IR receiver carried by the robotic camera. By detecting the\ndeviation in the signal transmitted by the transmitter as it moves with the\nobject, the IR receiver can establish the new position of the moving object\nand provide that information to the computer(s) controlling the robotic camera\nto displace the camera accordingly.\n\n\"The IR tracking technology described in the '629 patent works well for\ntracking a single moving object. However, tracking of multiple objects can\nprove problematic, such as in the case when a single robotic camera serves to\ncapture the image of several different on-air talent, as occurs when the\ncamera moves to capture the image of a news anchor at one instant, and a\nweather reporter at a different instant. Each different on-air talent would\nneed to carry a separate IR transmitter to avoid interference, thus\nnecessitating the need for multiple IR receivers on the camera. This IR system\nalso suffers from the disadvantage that the anchor person has to wear an\nembedded system that should be located at the center of the head to have an\naccurate estimate of the head position\n\n\"Thus, a need exists for a tracking technique that overcomes the\naforementioned disadvantage of the prior art.\"\n\nIn addition to the background information obtained for this patent\napplication, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors' summary\ninformation for this patent application: \"Briefly, in accordance with a\npreferred embodiment, there is provided a method for tracking an object within\nthe field of view of a robotically controlled camera. The method commences by\nfirst determining whether the object lying within the camera field of view\nmatches a reference object. If so, tracking of the object commences to\nmaintain the object in fixed relationship to a pre-set location in the\ncamera's field of view, provided the designated object has moved more than a\nthreshold distance from the pre-set location. In this way, tracking occurs in\naccordance with the camera's field of view, and does not depend on any\napparatus worn by the object being tracked.\"\n\nThe claims supplied by the inventors are:\n\n\"1\\.

(Luxembourg, Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>The following quote was obtained by the news editors from the background information supplied by the inventors: &#8220;Live production of a television program such as a news show often requires one or more television cameras to capture the image of different &#8216;on-air&#8217; talent, such as a news anchor, weather reporter and/or sports reporter. In the past, a camera operator would manually operate each television camera. Such manual operation often entailed moving the camera to different positions within a television studio to make sure that the particular on-air talent appeared in the center of the camera&#8217;s field of view. During broadcasting, the on-air talent often will make slight lateral movements, forcing the camera operator to displace the camera by a corresponding amount to maintain the on-air talent within the center of the camera&#8217;s field of view. The camera operator will generally observe the image of the on-air talent in the camera&#8217;s view finder so the operator will have immediate knowledge of the movement of the talent and move the camera accordingly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Advances in technology have led to the development of robotic television cameras, such as the &#8216;Cameraman&#8217;, available from <location>Thomson Grass Valley</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.jckvil\">Jacksonville, Fla.</location> Such robotic cameras operate under the control of one or more computers which manage functions such as camera displacement along the x, y, and z axes, pan, tilt, zoom and focus. By appropriately programming the computer(s), the camera will operate automatically, thus obviating the need for manual control. Typical robotic cameras have the ability to move from a known home position to one or more pre-set positions, each pre-set position enabling a particular camera shot of an on-air talent. Generally, the pre-set camera positions remain static. In other words, if the on-air talent moves even slightly to the right or left while the robotic camera remains static, then the on-air talent will appear off-center within the field of view of the camera.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To overcome this difficulty, robotic cameras can include automatic tracking technology such as such the tracking system described in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Pat. No. 5,668,629 issued in the name of <person>Jeffrey Parker</person> et al. The automatic tracking system described in the &#8216;629 patent employs a Infra-Red (BR) transmitter carried by the moving object (e.g., the on-air talent) for transmitting signals to an IR receiver carried by the robotic camera. By detecting the deviation in the signal transmitted by the transmitter as it moves with the object, the IR receiver can establish the new position of the moving object and provide that information to the computer(s) controlling the robotic camera to displace the camera accordingly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The IR tracking technology described in the &#8216;629 patent works well for tracking a single moving object. However, tracking of multiple objects can prove problematic, such as in the case when a single robotic camera serves to capture the image of several different on-air talent, as occurs when the camera moves to capture the image of a news anchor at one instant, and a weather reporter at a different instant. Each different on-air talent would need to carry a separate IR transmitter to avoid interference, thus necessitating the need for multiple IR receivers on the camera. This IR system also suffers from the disadvantage that the anchor person has to wear an embedded system that should be located at the center of the head to have an accurate estimate of the head position</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thus, a need exists for a tracking technique that overcomes the aforementioned disadvantage of the prior art.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the background information obtained for this patent application, NewsRx journalists also obtained the inventors&#8217; summary information for this patent application: &#8220;Briefly, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, there is provided a method for tracking an object within the field of view of a robotically controlled camera. The method commences by first determining whether the object lying within the camera field of view matches a reference object. If so, tracking of the object commences to maintain the object in fixed relationship to a pre-set location in the camera&#8217;s field of view, provided the designated object has moved more than a threshold distance from the pre-set location. In this way, tracking occurs in accordance with the camera&#8217;s field of view, and does not depend on any apparatus worn by the object being tracked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The claims supplied by the inventors are:</p>\n<p>&#8220;1.
