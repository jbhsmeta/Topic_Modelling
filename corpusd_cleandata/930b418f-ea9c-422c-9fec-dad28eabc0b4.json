    "text": "Tailback Phillip Lindsay and offensive lineman Dalton Risner are centerpieces\non the Broncos roster, and the Panthers' Christian McCaffrey recently signed\nthe richest deal for a running back in NFL history.\n\nThe professional rise of those three homegrown athletes raises the question:\nWho are the greatest NFL players to come out of Colorado? Here's a Top 10\nranking from The Denver Post. To qualify for this list, a player must have\nbeen born in the state and played high school football here as well (thus,\nFairview High grad and potential Hall of Famer Tony Boselli isn't listed).\n\n(Position, birthplace, years in NFL)\n\n10\\. Gary Knafelc\n\nTE | Pueblo | 1954-63\n\nA two-time Super Bowl champion, Knafelc is in Green Bay's Hall of Fame. A\ntight end, the Pueblo Central High School and CU product made several iconic\ncatches in Packers history - including the winning touchdown reception in the\nfirst game at Lambeau Field \\- and was also known for his blocking in\nadditional stints with the Cardinals and 49ers.\n\n9\\. Mark Mullaney\n\nDE | Denver | 1975-86\n\nA member of the CSU Hall of Fame, Mullaney starred at defensive end in\nMinnesota, where he was part of the \"Purple People Eaters\" defense and played\nin Super Bowl XI. The NFL did not begin recording sacks until 1982, so his\ncareer stats remain a mystery. In his final five seasons, however, the George\nWashington High graduate accumulated 13 1/2 sacks.\n\n8\\. Byron White\n\nTB/HB | Fort Collins | 1938-41\n\nAn All-American halfback at CU, \"Whizzer\" had a short but distinguished career\nin the NFL. The future Supreme Court judge led the league in rushing in 1938\nand 1940 to earn two All-Pro nods and finished his career with 1,622 total\nyards and 12 touchdowns.\n\n7\\. Luther Elliss\n\nDT/DE | Mancos | 1995-2004\n\nThe Macos High and Utah grad racked up 331 tackles and 29 sacks in his career\nand earned consecutive Pro Bowl nods in Detroit in 1999 and 2000 as a\ndefensive lineman. He finished his career with one season in Denver.\n\n6\\. Nate Solder\n\nOL | Denver | 2011-present\n\nBorn in Denver, the future CU Buffs star first made a name for himself as a\ntight end for Buena Vista High. A linchpin of Tom Brady's offensive line\nduring two Super Bowl title runs in New England, the reliable, gritty and\nheady left tackle has started all 16 games in a season five times in his\ncareer, including the last three seasons.\n\n5\\. Aaron Smith\n\nDE | Colorado Springs | 1999-2011\n\nA Northern Colorado and Sierra High grad, Smith won a pair of Super Bowl\nchampionships with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Lining up on the defensive line,\nhe piled up 481 tackles and 44 sacks during a lengthy career that saw him make\ndouble-digit starts for nine consecutive seasons from 2000-08.\n\n4\\. Christian McCaffrey\n\nRB | Castle Rock | 2017-present\n\nThe Valor Christian product may be the most electric high school player the\nstate has ever seen. After nearly winning the Heisman Trophy at Stanford,\nMcCaffrey was selected eighth overall by the Carolina Panthers in the 2017\ndraft and has amassed 5,443 yards from scrimmage and 39 touchdowns in three\nseasons. In 2019, he became the third player in NFL history to record 1,000\nyards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same year. If McCaffrey stays\nhealthy, Canton isn't out of the question.\n\n3\\. Vincent Jackson\n\nWR | Colorado Springs | 2005-16\n\nAn overlooked recruit out of Widefield High, Jackson turned down an\nopportunity to attend Columbia University of the Ivy League so he could play\nfootball and basketball for Northern Colorado. After setting UNC records in\nreceptions, receiving yards, kick return yards, punt return yards and\nreceiving touchdowns, the San Diego Chargers selected him with the 61st\noverall pick in the 2005 draft. The wideout accumulated 540 receptions for\n9,080 yards and 57 touchdowns over a 12-year career split between the Chargers\nand Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He led the NFL with a 19.2 yards-per-catch average\nin 2012 - one of three seasons that ended with a Pro Bowl selection.\n\n2\\. Calais Campbell\n\nDE | Denver | 2008-present\n\nOne of Denver South's finest, Campbell was recruited by the Miami Hurricanes\nout of high school and racked up 39 tackles for loss over three seasons before\nbeing selected 50th overall by the Arizona Cardinals in 2008. A five-time Pro\nBowler and an All-Pro selection in 2017, the 33-year-old has recorded 696\ntackles and 88 sacks in a career that's now approaching its 13th season. He\nreached the Super Bowl in his first year with Arizona and has played in three\nconference championship games - most recently in 2017 with Jacksonville. With\nCampbell headed to Baltimore this offseason, more postseason success may well\nbe on the way.\n\n1\\. Dutch Clark\n\nRB | Fowler | 1931-38\n\nThe only native Coloradan in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the \"Flying\nDutchman\" was part of Canton's inaugural class in 1963. Clark played at Pueblo\nCentral and Colorado College before joining the Portsmouth Spartans in 1931.\nThree years later, he began a five-year run with the Detroit Lions that saw\nhim rack up four of his six All-Pro nods and win an NFL championship in 1935.",

    "html": "<p>Tailback <person>Phillip Lindsay</person> and offensive lineman <person>Dalton Risner</person> are centerpieces on the Broncos roster, and the Panthers' <person>Christian McCaffrey</person> recently signed the richest deal for a running back in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> history.</p>\n<p>The professional rise of those three homegrown athletes raises the question: Who are the greatest <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> players to come out of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Colorado</location>? Here's a Top 10 ranking from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2189179515\">The Denver Post</org>. To qualify for this list, a player must have been born in the state and played high school football here as well (thus, <org>Fairview High</org> grad and potential Hall of Famer <person>Tony Boselli</person> isn't listed).</p>\n\n<p>(Position, birthplace, years in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org>)</p>\n\n<p>10. <person>Gary Knafelc</person></p>\n\n<p>TE | Pueblo | 1954-63</p>\n\n<p>A two-time <org>Super Bowl</org> champion, Knafelc is in <location>Green Bay's</location> Hall of Fame. A tight end, the <org>Pueblo Central High School</org> and CU product made several iconic catches in <org>Packers</org> history - including the winning touchdown reception in the first game at <location>Lambeau Field</location> - and was also known for his blocking in additional stints with the Cardinals and 49ers.</p>\n\n<p>9. <person>Mark Mullaney</person></p>\n\n<p>DE | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location> | 1975-86</p>\n\n<p>A member of the <org>CSU Hall of Fame</org>, Mullaney starred at defensive end in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location>, where he was part of the \"Purple People Eaters\" defense and played in Super Bowl XI. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> did not begin recording sacks until 1982, so his career stats remain a mystery. In his final five seasons, however, the <org>George Washington High</org> graduate accumulated 13 1/2 sacks.</p>\n\n<p>8. <person>Byron White</person></p>\n\n<p>TB/HB | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.forins\">Fort Collins</location> | 1938-41</p>\n\n<p>An All-American halfback at CU, \"Whizzer\" had a short but distinguished career in the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org>. The future Supreme Court judge led the league in rushing in 1938 and 1940 to earn two All-Pro nods and finished his career with 1,622 total yards and 12 touchdowns.</p>\n\n<p>7. <person>Luther Elliss</person></p>\n\n<p>DT/DE | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.mancos\">Mancos</location> | 1995-2004</p>\n\n<p><org>The Macos High</org> and Utah grad racked up 331 tackles and 29 sacks in his career and earned consecutive Pro Bowl nods in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.detrit\">Detroit</location> in 1999 and 2000 as a defensive lineman. He finished his career with one season in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>.</p>\n\n<p>6. <person>Nate Solder</person></p>\n\n<p>OL | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location> | 2011-present</p>\n\n<p>Born in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location>, the future CU Buffs star first made a name for himself as a tight end for <org>Buena Vista High</org>. A linchpin of <person>Tom Brady's</person> offensive line during two <org>Super Bowl</org> title runs in <location>New England</location>, the reliable, gritty and heady left tackle has started all 16 games in a season five times in his career, including the last three seasons.</p>\n\n<p>5. <person>Aaron Smith</person></p>\n\n<p>DE | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.clsprg\">Colorado Springs</location> | 1999-2011</p>\n\n<p>A <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Northern Colorado</location> and <org>Sierra High</org> grad, Smith won a pair of <org>Super Bowl</org> championships with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131524\">Pittsburgh Steelers</org>. Lining up on the defensive line, he piled up 481 tackles and 44 sacks during a lengthy career that saw him make double-digit starts for nine consecutive seasons from 2000-08.</p>\n\n<p>4. <person>Christian McCaffrey</person></p>\n\n<p>RB | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.casock\">Castle Rock</location> | 2017-present</p>\n\n<p>The Valor Christian product may be the most electric high school player the state has ever seen. After nearly winning the <org>Heisman Trophy</org> at <org>Stanford</org>, McCaffrey was selected eighth overall by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131545\">Carolina Panthers</org> in the 2017 draft and has amassed 5,443 yards from scrimmage and 39 touchdowns in three seasons. In 2019, he became the third player in <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> history to record 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same year. If McCaffrey stays healthy, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mi.canton\">Canton</location> isn't out of the question.</p>\n\n<p>3. <person>Vincent Jackson</person></p>\n\n<p>WR | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.clsprg\">Colorado Springs</location> | 2005-16</p>\n\n<p>An overlooked recruit out of <org>Widefield High</org>, Jackson turned down an opportunity to attend <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0479433608\">Columbia University</org> of the <org>Ivy League</org> so he could play football and basketball for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.co\">Northern Colorado</location>. After setting UNC records in receptions, receiving yards, kick return yards, punt return yards and receiving touchdowns, the San Diego Chargers selected him with the 61st overall pick in the 2005 draft. The wideout accumulated 540 receptions for 9,080 yards and 57 touchdowns over a 12-year career split between the Chargers and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131544\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</org>. He led the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> with a 19.2 yards-per-catch average in 2012 - one of three seasons that ended with a Pro Bowl selection.</p>\n\n<p>2. <person>Calais Campbell</person></p>\n\n<p>DE | <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.co.denver\">Denver</location> | 2008-present</p>\n\n<p>One of Denver South's finest, Campbell was recruited by the Miami Hurricanes out of high school and racked up 39 tackles for loss over three seasons before being selected 50th overall by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131550\">Arizona Cardinals</org> in 2008. A five-time Pro Bowler and an All-Pro selection in 2017, the 33-year-old has recorded 696 tackles and 88 sacks in a career that's now approaching its 13th season. He reached the <org>Super Bowl</org> in his first year with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.az\">Arizona</location> and has played in three conference championship games - most recently in 2017 with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.jckvil\">Jacksonville</location>. With Campbell headed to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.bltmre\">Baltimore</location> this offseason, more postseason success may well be on the way.</p>\n\n<p>1. <person>Dutch Clark</person></p>\n\n<p>RB | Fowler | 1931-38</p>\n\n<p>The only native Coloradan in the <org>Pro Football Hall of Fame</org>, the \"Flying Dutchman\" was part of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.md.canton\">Canton's</location> inaugural class in 1963. Clark played at <org>Pueblo Central</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3844622908\">Colorado College</org> before joining the Portsmouth Spartans in 1931. Three years later, he began a five-year run with the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:6001131539\">Detroit Lions</org> that saw him rack up four of his six All-Pro nods and win an <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0070395776\">NFL</org> championship in 1935.</p>",
