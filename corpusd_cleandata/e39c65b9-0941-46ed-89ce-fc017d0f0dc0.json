    "text": "FALL RIVER - St. Anne's Credit Union is financing nearly $500,000 to support\nthe expansion of Steppingstone, Inc.'s purchase and renovation of its new\noffice building at 111 Durfee St.\n\n\"This effort will assist them in increasing their support of the clients in\nneed of their services as they work to provide an array of treatment services\nto combat mental health disorders and homelessness,\" states a press release\nfrom St. Anne's Credit Union.\n\nCarlos DaCunha, St. Anne's Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer,\nsaid, \"As a top leading financial institution, we are proud of the long-term\nrelationship we have with Steppingstone and look forward to supporting its\ncontinued growth and positive impact as this relationship exemplifies our\ncontinued commitment to community development.\"\n\n\"Steppingstone does a commendable job in Fall River and New Bedford to offer a\nvariety of services and programs that help individuals and families build a\nstrong foundation for recovery. They have been serving the community since\n1972 and this expansion will contribute to their growth for years to come. As\nTreasurer of the Board of Directors of Steppingstone for 10 years and employed\nby St. Anne's for over 25 years, I am proud to be associated with both\norganizations as they seek to strengthen the areas that we all live and work\nin\", said Michelle Marcos, St. Anne's Senior Vice President of Human\nResources.\n\nKathleen Schedler-Clark, Steppingstone's Executive Director, said, \"St. Anne's\nhas been a wonderful community partner of ours for many years. In 2014, when\nwe moved the First Step Inn to a larger building, St. Anne's stepped up to the\nplate with a $30,000 grant to allow us to accommodate additional beds and\nserve more of the homeless population. With this financing, the St. Anne's\nteam made the transaction seamless, quick - and offered an unbeatable rate.\nThis space is the pivotal piece to allow us to build an accessible, safe, and\nwelcoming office building to serve even more people in need. The lending from\nSt. Anne's allows us to focus on what matters: offering our clients only the\nbest.\"",
