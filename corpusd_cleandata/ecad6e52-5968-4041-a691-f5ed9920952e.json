    "text": "Shortly after NASA astronauts blasted off from U. S. soil for the first time\nsince 2011, President Trump painted a dire picture of what the space agency\nhad looked like when he first came to office.\n\n\"There was grass growing through the cracks of your concrete runways--not a\npretty sight, not a pretty sight at all,\" he said at NASA's enormous Vehicle\nAssembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where he had come to\nwatch two astronauts launch to orbit in a vehicle owned and operated by\nSpaceX.\n\n\"With this launch, the decades of lost years and little action are officially\nover,\" he said. \"Past leaders put the United States at the mercy of foreign\nnations to send our astronauts into orbit--not anymore. Today we once again\nproudly launch American astronauts on American rockets--the best in the world\n--from right here on American soil.\"\n\nActually, it was two past presidents who put NASA on the path to this SpaceX\nlaunch, though it would be hard to know that from listening to the post-launch\nspeeches.\n\n\"Today is the culmination of three and a half years of renewed leadership in\nspace,\" said Vice President Mike Pence, who called the launch \"a tribute to\nthe vision and leadership of a president who, from the very first days of this\nadministration, was determined to revive NASA and American leadership in human\nspace exploration.\"\n\nThe groundwork for sending NASA astronauts up on a commercial space vehicle,\nhowever, goes back more than a decade. It proceeded steadily under both\nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n\n\"This is a program that demonstrates the success when you have continuity of\npurpose going from one administration to the next,\" said NASA administrator\nJim Bridenstine in a recent pre-flight briefing.\n\nIn 2006, under President George W. Bush, the space agency started a program to\nget commercial companies to begin delivering cargo to the international space\nstation.\n\nThe idea was to save money for taxpayers by having NASA buy delivery services\nrather than own and operate its own cargo ships. This would also provide a\nfinancial incentive for the private sector to develop new spacecraft that\ncould be used both by NASA and by other paying customers.\n\nThe plan worked. In 2012, an unoccupied, robotic SpaceX capsule successfully\ndocked with the International Space Station-a first for a commercially-owned\nand operated spaceship.\n\nHaving companies take astronauts to the outpost was a natural extension of\nthis cargo program. NASA announced its commercial crew program in 2010, under\nPresident Barack Obama.\n\nCompanies that received initial funding for developing spaceships that could\nserve as space taxis included Blue Origin, Boeing, Paragon Space Development\nCorporation, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and United Launch Alliance.\n\nIn 2014, NASA selected SpaceX and Boeing to transport its astronauts, awarding\nthem contracts worth $6.8 billion. A year later, the agency named four\nastronauts who would eventually fly in these spaceships-including Robert\nBehnken and Douglas Hurley, the two crew members assigned to the SpaceX test\nflight that launched on Saturday.\n\nThe shift to commercial crew transportation services in 2010, coming just as\nthe agency's 30-year-old space shuttle program was winding down, marked a real\nchange for NASA. Many were skeptical, especially in Congress. Bridenstine\ncredits former NASA administrator Charles Bolden, who served under President\nObama, for his efforts to make it happen.\n\n\"Charlie Bolden did just yeoman's work in order to get this program off the\nground, to get it going, and here we are all these years later, having this\nsuccess,\" said Bridenstine in that pre-flight briefing.\n\nThe space program has historically united people across political divides, he\nnoted, adding that the same will be true for this unprecedented SpaceX launch.\n\n\"It's not just going to unite Republicans and Democrats, it's going to unite\nthe world. The whole world is going to be watching this particular launch, and\nall of our international partners are very interested,\" said Bridenstine.\n\nHe also, however, gave credit to his boss. \"President Trump has been a massive\nspace advocate. He promised to launch American astronauts on American rockets.\nHe promised to create a moon program,\" said Bridenstine. \"He's done both of\nthose and he's backed it up with his budget requests, not just with the\nwords.\"\n\nBut when Bridenstine recently tweeted that \"Under President Trump's\nleadership, we are once again launching American astronauts on American\nrockets from American soil,\" one astronaut took issue with that statement,\npointing out that the commercial crew program had started in 2010, years\nbefore Trump took was elected.\n\n\"I am thankful for the continued support from you and the Administration, but\nif there is a President to thank for this milestone, it's @BarackObama,\"\ntweeted Garrett Reisman, a former NASA astronaut who spent years working for\nSpaceX and has served as a consultant for the company.\n\nThe Trump administration has told NASA to return humans to the surface of the\nmoon by 2024, the last year of what would be a second Trump administration if\nthe president is re-elected. That deadline is seen as an unrealistic long shot\nby many in the space community.\n\nThe moon effort was being spearheaded by Douglas Loverro, the head of human\nspaceflight at NASA. But last week, he was forced to resign, because of what\nhe said was a mistake he had made earlier this year in effort to fulfill the\nmission.\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR.

    "title": "Trump Takes Credit For Space Launch That Got Its Start A Decade Ago",
    "html": "<p>Shortly after <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> astronauts blasted off from U. S. soil for the first time since 2011, <person>President Trump</person> painted a dire picture of what the space agency had looked like when he first came to office.</p>\n<p>\"There was grass growing through the cracks of your concrete runways--not a pretty sight, not a pretty sight at all,\" he said at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>'s enormous <location>Vehicle Assembly Building</location> at <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.kenter\">Kennedy Space Center</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>, where he had come to watch two astronauts launch to orbit in a vehicle owned and operated by <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"With this launch, the decades of lost years and little action are officially over,\" he said. \"Past leaders put <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit--not anymore. Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets--the best in the world--from right here on American soil.\"</p>\n\n<p>Actually, it was two past presidents who put <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> on the path to this <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> launch, though it would be hard to know that from listening to the post-launch speeches.</p>\n\n<p>\"Today is the culmination of three and a half years of renewed leadership in space,\" said Vice President <person>Mike Pence</person>, who called the launch \"a tribute to the vision and leadership of a president who, from the very first days of this administration, was determined to revive <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> and American leadership in human space exploration.\"</p>\n\n<p>The groundwork for sending <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> astronauts up on a commercial space vehicle, however, goes back more than a decade. It proceeded steadily under both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is a program that demonstrates the success when you have continuity of purpose going from one administration to the next,\" said <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> administrator <person>Jim Bridenstine</person> in a recent pre-flight briefing.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006, under President <person>George W. Bush</person>, the space agency started a program to get commercial companies to begin delivering cargo to the international space station.</p>\n\n<p>The idea was to save money for taxpayers by having <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> buy delivery services rather than own and operate its own cargo ships. This would also provide a financial incentive for the private sector to develop new spacecraft that could be used both by <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> and by other paying customers.</p>\n\n<p>The plan worked. In 2012, an unoccupied, robotic <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> capsule successfully docked with the <location>International Space Station</location>-a first for a commercially-owned and operated spaceship.</p>\n\n<p>Having companies take astronauts to the outpost was a natural extension of this cargo program. <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> announced its commercial crew program in 2010, under President <person>Barack Obama</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Companies that received initial funding for developing spaceships that could serve as space taxis included Blue Origin, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3849689551\">Paragon Space Development Corporation</org>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1756739369\">Sierra Nevada Corporation</org>, and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0261758647\">United Launch Alliance</org>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> selected <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"NYSE:BA\">Boeing</org> to transport its astronauts, awarding them contracts worth <money>$6.8 billion</money>. A year later, the agency named four astronauts who would eventually fly in these spaceships-including <person>Robert Behnken</person> and <person>Douglas Hurley</person>, the two crew members assigned to the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> test flight that launched on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p>The shift to commercial crew transportation services in 2010, coming just as the agency's 30-year-old space shuttle program was winding down, marked a real change for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>. Many were skeptical, especially in <org>Congress</org>. Bridenstine credits former <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> administrator <person value=\"APIN:2446542170\">Charles Bolden</person>, who served under <person>President Obama</person>, for his efforts to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>\"<person value=\"APIN:2446542170\">Charlie Bolden</person> did just yeoman's work in order to get this program off the ground, to get it going, and here we are all these years later, having this success,\" said Bridenstine in that pre-flight briefing.</p>\n\n<p>The space program has historically united people across political divides, he noted, adding that the same will be true for this unprecedented <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> launch.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's not just going to unite <org>Republicans</org> and <org>Democrats</org>, it's going to unite the world. The whole world is going to be watching this particular launch, and all of our international partners are very interested,\" said Bridenstine.</p>\n\n<p>He also, however, gave credit to his boss. \"<person>President Trump</person> has been a massive space advocate. He promised to launch American astronauts on American rockets. He promised to create a moon program,\" said Bridenstine. \"He's done both of those and he's backed it up with his budget requests, not just with the words.\"</p>\n\n<p>But when Bridenstine recently tweeted that \"Under <person>President Trump's</person> leadership, we are once again launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,\" one astronaut took issue with that statement, pointing out that the commercial crew program had started in 2010, years before Trump took was elected.</p>\n\n<p>\"I am thankful for the continued support from you and the Administration, but if there is a President to thank for this milestone, it's @BarackObama,\" tweeted <person>Garrett Reisman</person>, a former <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> astronaut who spent years working for <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3692635053\">SpaceX</org> and has served as a consultant for the company.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has told <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org> to return humans to the surface of the moon by 2024, the last year of what would be a second Trump administration if the president is re-elected. That deadline is seen as an unrealistic long shot by many in the space community.</p>\n\n<p>The moon effort was being spearheaded by <person>Douglas Loverro</person>, the head of human spaceflight at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3623106431\">NASA</org>. But last week, he was forced to resign, because of what he said was a mistake he had made earlier this year in effort to fulfill the mission.</p>\n\n<p>Copyright 2020 NPR.
