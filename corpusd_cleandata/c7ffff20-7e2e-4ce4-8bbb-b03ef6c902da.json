    "text": "In a Thursday morning press conference, Richmond City Mayor Levar Stoney and\nGovernor Ralph Northam announced that the statue of General Robert E. Lee will\nbe removed from display on Monument Avenue in Richmond. The statue will go\ninto storage and, according to Northam, the community will have a say in its\nfuture.\n\nMayor Stoney opened the press conference by saying, \"It's time. It's time to\nput an end to the lost cause and fully embrace the righteous cause. It's time\nto replace the racist symbols of oppression and inequality.\" He proudly\nannounced that \"Richmond is no longer the Capital of the confederacy.\" It has\nbeen over 100 years since the confederate monuments have been erected in the\nstate capital.\n\n\"We have two pandemics in this country. COVID-19 and racism. One is six months\nold. The other 400 years old. As the events of the last months and the last\ntwo weeks have made painfully clear both are lethal, especially for black and\nbrown people. It is our responsibility to do everything that we can to keep\nfrom claiming more lives in the country and in this world. We need to show\nthat black and brown lives matter. This is our moral duty.\"\n\n\"Today we're here to be honest about our past and talk about our future.\" said\nGovernor Northam. \"When Americans first dreamed of life, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness, they dreamed here in our Commonwealth. Virginia adopted\na declaration of rights before the United States drafted the Declaration of\nIndependence.\"\n\nNortham referenced Virginia's first elected Governor, Patrick Henry's infamous\n\"Give me liberty or give me death\" speech that helped to launch the American\nRevolution. \"These are our greatest legacies as Americans, but there's a whole\nlot more to the story because those inspiring words and high ideals did not\napply to everyone. Not then and not now because at the bottom of the very same\nhill [where Patrick Henry gave his speech] one of the countries largest slave\ntrading markets was coming to life. A place where Virginians would buy and\nsell men, women, and children for profit.\"\n\n\"Symbols matter and Virginia has never been able to deal with symbols, until\nnow.\" said Northam. Virginia houses more confederate commemorations than any\nother state. \"Generations ago, Virginia made the decision, not to celebrate\nunity, but to honor the cause of division.\" The Governor also pointed out that\nGeneral Lee did not want to have a statue of himself on display saying \"I\nthink it is wiser not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the example\nof those nations who endeavor to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to\ncommit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\"\n\n\"From the beginning there was no secret about what the statue meant. Almost\nall of the 150,000 people [in attendance when the statue was placed] waved\nconfederate flags that day.\" says Northam. HE then quoted an article written\nby John Mitchell, the editor of black newspaper, The Richmond Planet, stating\n\"The emblem of the union had been left behind. A glorification of the lost\ncause is everywhere.\"\n\nAt the time of the statues raising, new laws were put into place that limited\nthe right to vote. \"In the years after the civil war more than 100,000 African\nAmerican men were registered to vote in Virginia but once this campaign took\noff that number plummeted by 90% to barely 10,000. He continued, \"They wrote\nother new laws to say that once a statue goes up, it can never come down. They\nwanted the statues to remain forever. They needed the statues to remain\nforever for the system to stay in place.\"\n\nThis year the Governor proposed legislation to let cities and counties\ndetermine what to do with monuments within their communities. They can take\nthem down, move them, or add additional context. The law takes affect in four\nweeks.\n\nGovernor Northam is acting under his executive authority and Section \u00a7\n2.2-2402 of the Code of Virginia, which provides the Governor the sole\nauthority to approve the removal of a work of art owned by the Commonwealth\nupon submission of a plan to do so. The Robert E. Lee monument was erected for\nand is owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia and is considered a work of art\npursuant to Section 2.2-2401 of the Code of Virginia.\n\nOn Monday, June 8, a Richmond judge issued an injunction to prevent the\nremoval of the Confederate General Robert E. Lee statue in Virginia for at\nleast 10 days. The injunction maintains that the state is part of a deed that\nwas recorded in March of 1890 that bestowed the property the statue sits on to\nVirginia. Part of the agreement in the original deed, was a vow to \"faithfully\nguard\" and \"affectionately protect\" the statue, pedestal and land in question.",

It's time to replace the racist symbols of oppression and inequality.\" He proudly announced that \"<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.rchmnd\">Richmond</location> is no longer the Capital of the confederacy.\" It has been over 100 years since the confederate monuments have been erected in the state capital.</p>\n\n<p>\"We have two pandemics in this country. COVID-19 and racism. One is six months old. The other 400 years old. As the events of the last months and the last two weeks have made painfully clear both are lethal, especially for black and brown people. It is our responsibility to do everything that we can to keep from claiming more lives in the country and in this world. We need to show that black and brown lives matter. This is our moral duty.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Today we're here to be honest about our past and talk about our future.\" said <person>Governor Northam</person>. \"When Americans first dreamed of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, they dreamed here in our Commonwealth. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> adopted a declaration of rights before <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> drafted the Declaration of Independence.\"</p>\n\n<p>Northam referenced <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia's</location> first elected Governor, Patrick Henry's infamous \"Give me liberty or give me death\" speech that helped to launch the American Revolution. \"These are our greatest legacies as Americans, but there's a whole lot more to the story because those inspiring words and high ideals did not apply to everyone. Not then and not now because at the bottom of the very same hill [where Patrick Henry gave his speech] one of the countries largest slave trading markets was coming to life. A place where Virginians would buy and sell men, women, and children for profit.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Symbols matter and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> has never been able to deal with symbols, until now.\" said Northam. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> houses more confederate commemorations than any other state. \"Generations ago, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> made the decision, not to celebrate unity, but to honor the cause of division.\" The Governor also pointed out that <person>General Lee</person> did not want to have a statue of himself on display saying \"I think it is wiser not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the example of those nations who endeavor to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"From the beginning there was no secret about what the statue meant. Almost all of the 150,000 people [in attendance when the statue was placed] waved confederate flags that day.\" says Northam. HE then quoted an article written by <person>John Mitchell</person>, the editor of black newspaper, The Richmond Planet, stating \"The emblem of the union had been left behind. A glorification of the lost cause is everywhere.\"</p>\n\n<p>At the time of the statues raising, new laws were put into place that limited the right to vote. \"In the years after the civil war more than 100,000 <org>African American</org> men were registered to vote in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> but once this campaign took off that number plummeted by 90% to barely 10,000. He continued, \"They wrote other new laws to say that once a statue goes up, it can never come down. They wanted the statues to remain forever. They needed the statues to remain forever for the system to stay in place.\"</p>\n\n<p>This year the Governor proposed legislation to let cities and counties determine what to do with monuments within their communities. They can take them down, move them, or add additional context. The law takes affect in four weeks.</p>\n\n<p><person>Governor Northam</person> is acting under his executive authority and Section &#167; 2.2-2402 of the Code of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>, which provides the Governor the sole authority to approve the removal of a work of art owned by the Commonwealth upon submission of a plan to do so. The Robert E. Lee monument was erected for and is owned by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0894370035\">Commonwealth of Virginia</org> and is considered a work of art pursuant to Section 2.2-2401 of the Code of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>.</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>Monday, June 8</chron>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.rchmnd\">Richmond</location> judge issued an injunction to prevent the removal of the Confederate General <person>Robert E. Lee</person> statue in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location> for at least 10 days. The injunction maintains that the state is part of a deed that was recorded in March of 1890 that bestowed the property the statue sits on to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>. Part of the agreement in the original deed, was a vow to \"faithfully guard\" and \"affectionately protect\" the statue, pedestal and land in question.</p>",
