    "text": "SALISBURY \u0096 Catawba College announced plans Tuesday to bring students back to\ncampus for the fall semester in mid-August, with the end of in-person classes\nscheduled before Thanksgiving, Provost Constance Rogers Lowery said. There\nwill be no fall break, in order to allow for the early end of the fall\nsemester, and final exams will be conducted remotely.\n\n\"Medical and public health professionals believe that we could experience a\nsecond wave of COVID-19 in late fall or early winter, coinciding with the\ntypical flu season,\" Lowery said. \"Due to that possibility, Catawba will shift\nthe 2020 academic calendar to end in-person classes before Thanksgiving.\"\n\nIn a \"Return to Catawba\" Plan, fall Welcome Weekend activities will be held on\nAug. 14 and Aug. 17, with new students arriving on Aug. 14. All other\nreturning residential students will move in on Aug. 16. Fall classes will\nstart Aug. 18. Returning student athletes and students in leadership groups\nwill be told of their return dates by coaches and campus leaders, who will\ncommunicate directly with these students. The Opening Convocation will be held\nin Shuford Stadium on Aug. 17, weather permitting.\n\nThe last day of classes on campus will be Nov. 24. Final exams will be held\nremotely during the week of Nov. 30-Dec. 4. Other ceremonies, performances,\nand traditions may be rescheduled, with details to be provided as plans are\ndeveloped.\n\nDean of Students Jared Tice said the college knows prospective students are\nstill deciding where to attend college this fall and Catawba is prepared for\nnew students.\n\nSafety plans include:\n\nImplementation of daily screening procedures for presence of symptoms\nindicative of COVID- 19.\n\nAdjustment of class sizes, based on recommendations for safe occupancy and\nphysical distancing. Additionally, the College is exploring options for\nclasses in larger venues, including outdoor spaces.\n\nImplementation of enhanced housekeeping procedures. Restrooms and work spaces\nwill be cleaned according to CDC guidelines, and high-touch objects (such as\ndoorknobs and handrails) will be cleaned with greater frequency.\n\nAdditional stations for hand sanitizing will be available in all buildings.\n\nDoors, staircases, and hallways may be marked with directional signage to help\nwith flow of foot traffic and allow for physical distancing.\n\nA requirement that all campus members wear masks in hallways, common areas,\nclassrooms, and other indicated areas.\n\nThe Catawba Proctor Health Center is staffed by two registered nurses and\noffers on-campus physician hours for our students.\n\nFor returning students, the College is offering an enhanced selection of\nonline courses. Students may work with their advisors to explore options that\nare available to them to make satisfactory progress in their degree programs.\n\nFor first-time students who need the option, the College will offer Catawba At\nHome, with the fall semester courses completely online. Students will take a\nspecial section of first year seminar, as well as several general education\ncourses online. Students will take these courses as a cohort, while\nparticipating in enrichment activities that help them connect to our campus\ncommunity and college experience.\n\nLowery said that over the coming weeks and months, the College will continue\nto communicate with students and their families to keep them up to date with\nthe latest information and planning.",

    "html": "<p>SALISBURY &#150; <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1781059046\">Catawba College</org> announced plans Tuesday to bring students back to campus for the fall semester in mid-August, with the end of in-person classes scheduled before <chron>Thanksgiving</chron>, Provost <person>Constance Rogers Lowery</person> said. There will be no fall break, in order to allow for the early end of the fall semester, and final exams will be conducted remotely.</p>\n<p>\"Medical and public health professionals believe that we could experience a second wave of COVID-19 in late fall or early winter, coinciding with the typical flu season,\" Lowery said. \"Due to that possibility, Catawba will shift the 2020 academic calendar to end in-person classes before <chron>Thanksgiving</chron>.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a \"Return to Catawba\" Plan, fall Welcome Weekend activities will be held on <chron>Aug. 14</chron> and <chron>Aug. 17</chron>, with new students arriving on <chron>Aug. 14</chron>. All other returning residential students will move in on <chron>Aug. 16</chron>. Fall classes will start <chron>Aug. 18</chron>. Returning student athletes and students in leadership groups will be told of their return dates by coaches and campus leaders, who will communicate directly with these students. The Opening Convocation will be held in <location>Shuford Stadium</location> on <chron>Aug. 17</chron>, weather permitting.</p>\n\n<p>The last day of classes on campus will be <chron>Nov. 24</chron>. Final exams will be held remotely during the week of <chron>Nov. 30-Dec. 4</chron>. Other ceremonies, performances, and traditions may be rescheduled, with details to be provided as plans are developed.</p>\n\n<p>Dean of Students <person>Jared Tice</person> said the college knows prospective students are still deciding where to attend college this fall and Catawba is prepared for new students.</p>\n\n<p>Safety plans include:</p>\n\n<p>Implementation of daily screening procedures for presence of symptoms indicative of COVID- 19.</p>\n\n<p>Adjustment of class sizes, based on recommendations for safe occupancy and physical distancing. Additionally, the College is exploring options for classes in larger venues, including outdoor spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Implementation of enhanced housekeeping procedures. Restrooms and work spaces will be cleaned according to CDC guidelines, and high-touch objects (such as doorknobs and handrails) will be cleaned with greater frequency.</p>\n\n<p>Additional stations for hand sanitizing will be available in all buildings.</p>\n\n<p>Doors, staircases, and hallways may be marked with directional signage to help with flow of foot traffic and allow for physical distancing.</p>\n\n<p>A requirement that all campus members wear masks in hallways, common areas, classrooms, and other indicated areas.</p>\n\n<p><org>The Catawba Proctor Health Center</org> is staffed by two registered nurses and offers on-campus physician hours for our students.</p>\n\n<p>For returning students, the College is offering an enhanced selection of online courses. Students may work with their advisors to explore options that are available to them to make satisfactory progress in their degree programs.</p>\n\n<p>For first-time students who need the option, the College will offer Catawba At Home, with the fall semester courses completely online. Students will take a special section of first year seminar, as well as several general education courses online. Students will take these courses as a cohort, while participating in enrichment activities that help them connect to our campus community and college experience.</p>\n\n<p>Lowery said that over the coming weeks and months, the College will continue to communicate with students and their families to keep them up to date with the latest information and planning.</p>",
