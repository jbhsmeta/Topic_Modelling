    "text": "When the NBA suspended its season amid the coronavirus pandemic, Celtics\nforward Javonte Green received an invitation from teammate Kemba Walker to\ncome down to Charlotte.\n\nThe offer to live with Walker and rookie Grant Williams was enticing, but\nGreen stayed put three hours north in Virginia. He couldn't pass up the\nopportunity to spend extended time with his two daughters, Khloe, who will\nturn 8 years old later this month, and Kylie, who is 2.\n\n\"They're my everything,'' Green said. \"They're my world.''\n\nPrior to signing a two-year contract with the Celtics in July, Green played\nbasketball overseas for four seasons, most recently with ratiopharm Ulm in\nGermany. Nine months out of each year were largely spent in Europe; only three\nin the US. He missed Kylie's birth as well as her first steps, and had to hear\nher first words via FaceTime.\n\nFor Green, earning a spot on the Celtics' roster wasn't just about playing in\nthe NBA. His ultimate goal was to be closer to his daughters.\n\nLately, Green has been working with Khloe on learning her multiplication\ntable, a task that he jokes is testing his patience. Other highlights of their\nrecent time together include Green, after 15 or so attempts, figuring out how\nto tie a ponytail and Khloe nailing her one-handed cartwheel.\n\nThey'll spend hours outdoors, jumping on the trampoline and playing tag.\nThey'll dance together to songs popularized by Tik Tok, including Drake's\n\"Toosie Slide' and Wiz Khalifa's \"Something New.'' Khloe also enjoys drawing\nand messing around with makeup. She's painted her dad's nails multiple times,\nonce a glittery purple and once a burgundy red.\n\nBut there are concepts Green has to introduce to Khloe that run counter to the\nbliss of being 8 years old.\n\n\"I just want her to know that because you're Black, some people will look at\nyou different,'' Green said. \"I just want you to know that it's not your fault\nthat you're Black.''\n\nLast week, George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed in Minneapolis\npolice custody after an officer knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46\nseconds. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed\ninside her apartment after Louisville police officers fired more than 20 shots\nat her and her boyfriend. In February, Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man,\nwas killed by two white men while jogging.\n\n\"I could've been George Floyd,'' Green said. \"Any of my brothers, any of my\ncousins could have been that person.''\n\nAs Green grapples with the gravity of recent events, he can't help but think\nabout his children. Kylie is far too young, but Khloe is at an age, Green\nfeels, where she can grasp the basics behind these tragedies.\n\n\"I want them to understand what's going on, but at the same time, I don't want\nthem to have to worry about things like that,'' Green said. \"I feel like\n[Khloe] understands what's going on, to a certain extent, but she don't\nunderstand the bigger picture. She's still just figuring out the world.''\n\nFollowing Floyd's death, protests against systemic racism and police brutality\nhave taken place across the country. Celtics forward Jaylen Brown drove 15\nhours to organize and lead a protest in Atlanta, while Marcus Smart, Enes\nKanter, and Vincent Poirier participated in a protest in downtown Boston.\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens penned a letter to the team, expressing his\nsadness, support, and solidarity, while also recognizing his inability to feel\nthe depths of the Black community's pain.\n\n\"Everybody's not in the same boat, but coming from Coach Brad, it means a lot\nbecause he's a very genuine guy,'' Green said. \"I feel like everything he\nsays, he means. That came through from him. It was some kind words, and I\nreally appreciated the words he sent.''\n\nGreen wants to be part of the solution, but he doesn't know all the answers.\nHow do you protect your kids from a threat that has been ingrained in society\nfor centuries?\n\n\"That's the crazy thing,'' Green said. \"I don't know which way it's going to\ngo. It can go so many ways. It can literally be a war inside America. Me\nhaving kids is just like: What do you do? How can you protect them?''\n\nProtesting and raising awareness is only the beginning. Green has faith in the\npotential of the youth -- and will do what he can to help facilitate their\ngrowth and create change.\n\n\"Everything that I do is for them to have a better life, so they don't have to\ngrow up worrying about the things that I did,'' he said. \"As a parent, the\nonly thought in my mind is: I got to keep them safe. I can't fail them. Kids\nare the future. You just got to protect them with all your might.''",

    "html": "<block class=\"txt\">\n\n            <p />\n            <p>When the NBA suspended its season amid the coronavirus pandemic, Celtics forward <person>Javonte Green</person> received an invitation from teammate <person>Kemba Walker</person> to come down to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.va.charlt\">Charlotte</location>.</p>\n            <p>The offer to live with Walker and rookie <person>Grant Williams</person> was enticing, but Green stayed put three hours north in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.va\">Virginia</location>. He couldn&#8217;t pass up the opportunity to spend extended time with his two daughters, Khloe, who will turn 8 years old later this month, and Kylie, who is 2.</p>\n            <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re my everything,&#8217;&#8217; Green said. &#8220;They&#8217;re my world.&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n            <p>Prior to signing a two-year contract with the Celtics in July, Green played basketball overseas for four seasons, most recently with ratiopharm Ulm in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>. Nine months out of each year were largely spent in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>; only three in the US. He missed Kylie&#8217;s birth as well as her first steps, and had to hear her first words via FaceTime.</p>\n            <p>For Green, earning a spot on the Celtics&#8217;  roster wasn&#8217;t just about playing in the NBA. His ultimate goal  was to be closer to his daughters.</p>\n            <p>Lately, Green has been working with Khloe on learning her multiplication table, a task that he jokes is testing his patience. Other highlights of their recent time together include Green, after 15 or so attempts, figuring out how to tie a ponytail and Khloe nailing her one-handed cartwheel.</p>\n            <p>They&#8217;ll spend hours outdoors, jumping on the trampoline and playing tag. They&#8217;ll dance together to songs popularized by <person>Tik Tok</person>, including Drake&#8217;s &#8220;Toosie Slide&#8217; and Wiz Khalifa&#8217;s &#8220;Something New.&#8217;&#8217; Khloe also enjoys drawing and messing around with makeup. She&#8217;s painted her dad&#8217;s nails multiple times, once a glittery purple and once a burgundy red.</p>\n            <p>But there are concepts Green has to introduce to Khloe that run counter to the bliss of being 8 years old.</p>\n            <p>&#8220;I just want her to know that because you&#8217;re Black, some people will look at you different,&#8217;&#8217; Green said. &#8220;I just want you to know that it&#8217;s not your fault that you&#8217;re Black.&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n            <p>Last week, <person>George Floyd</person>, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. In March, <person>Breonna Taylor</person>, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed inside her apartment after Louisville police officers fired more than 20 shots at her and her boyfriend. In February, <person>Ahmaud Arbery</person>, a 25-year-old Black man, was killed by two white men while jogging.</p>\n            <p>&#8220;I could&#8217;ve been George Floyd,&#8217;&#8217; Green said. &#8220;Any of my brothers, any of my cousins could have been that person.&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n            <p>As Green grapples with the gravity of recent events, he can&#8217;t help but think about his children. Kylie is far too young, but Khloe is at an age, Green feels, where she can grasp the basics behind these tragedies.</p>\n            <p>&#8220;I want them to understand what&#8217;s going on, but at the same time, I don&#8217;t want them to have to worry about things like that,&#8217;&#8217; Green said. &#8220;I feel like [Khloe] understands what&#8217;s going on, to a certain extent, but she don&#8217;t understand the bigger picture. She&#8217;s still just figuring out the world.&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n            <p>Following Floyd&#8217;s death, protests against systemic racism and police brutality have taken place across the country. Celtics forward <person>Jaylen Brown</person> drove 15 hours to organize and lead a protest in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ga.atlnta\">Atlanta</location>, while <person>Marcus Smart</person>, <person>Enes Kanter</person>, and <person>Vincent Poirier</person> participated in a protest in downtown <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ma.boston\">Boston</location>.</p>\n            <p>Celtics coach <person>Brad Stevens</person> penned a letter to the team, expressing his sadness, support, and solidarity, while also recognizing his inability to feel the depths of the Black community&#8217;s pain.</p>\n            <p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s not in the same boat, but coming from <person>Coach Brad</person>, it means a lot because he&#8217;s a very genuine guy,&#8217;&#8217; Green said. &#8220;I feel like everything he says, he means. That came through from him. It was some kind words, and I really appreciated the words he sent.&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n            <p> Green wants to be part of the solution, but he doesn&#8217;t know all the answers. How do you protect your kids from a threat that has been ingrained in society for centuries?</p>\n            <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the crazy thing,&#8217;&#8217; Green said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know which way it&#8217;s going to go. It can go so many ways. It can literally be a war inside America. Me having kids is just like: What do you do? How can you protect them?&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n            <p>Protesting and raising awareness is only the beginning. Green has faith in the potential of the youth &#8212; and will do what he can to help facilitate their growth and create change.</p>\n            <p>&#8220;Everything that I do is for them to have a better life, so they don&#8217;t have to grow up worrying about the things that I did,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;As a parent, the only thought in my mind is: I got to keep them safe. I can&#8217;t fail them. Kids are the future. You just got to protect them with all your might.&#8217;&#8217;</p>\n         </block>",
