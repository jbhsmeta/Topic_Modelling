These\ntools offer a smart and effective way to stay in the fight during such a\ncrisis. As we all know, our mission is too important to the veterans and\nfamilies we serve to not push forward. However, doing so smartly, without\nrisking anyone's health in the process, is the goal.\n\nTo continue advancing our cause and promoting policies that ensure veterans\nand their families can live with respect and dignity, DAV and its members must\nevolve with the times and use every available resource at our disposal.\n\nWe work hard each day to find new and innovative ways to help our recruiters\nin the field. Today, DAV continues to evolve on social media, and DAV members\nare leveraging technology to continue to play vital roles as spokespeople for\nthe unique requirements of veterans and their loved ones. One way DAV has\nevolved is the online membership application. Since nearly everyone has a\nsmartphone, nearly everyone has a membership application within arm's reach.\n\nThis technology provides us with the mobility and flexibility to introduce\nanyone at any time to DAV and the value of being a member.\n\nOne of our more recent recruitment initiatives--and one we're excited to\ncontinue--is the Recruit a Warrior program. It is designed to help our members\nreach as many veterans as possible.\n\nTo participate, all you have to do is follow these two simple steps:\n\n1\\. Enter your email address at [dav.org/warrior](http://dav.org/warrior) to\nreceive your personalized referral link.\n\n2\\. Share your referral link with fellow warriors. This link is unique to you\nand will automatically track how many new members you've recruited.\n\nWe understand the challenges veterans face, and that is why, when speaking\nwith a potential member, we must illustrate the whole picture of DAV's mission\nand services. From securing earned benefits and providing transportation to\noperating an employment program and supporting volunteer initiatives, DAV\nhelps veterans and gives us the opportunity to serve in meaningful ways.\n\nWe can work smarter and not harder if we, as an organization, develop good\nhabits and utilize the tools available to us.\n\nFrom the NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP DIRECTOR DOUGLAS K. WELLS JR.",

    "html": "<p>As we get closer to completing another membership year of inspiring\nthose in the veteran community to join our DAV family, I want to thank\neach of you for your work in helping grow our membership ranks so we can\nbecome even stronger advocates for veterans' issues on <org>Capitol\nHill</org>.</p>\n\n<p>In the wake of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak across the globe, I\nthought now was the perfect time to stress our online and digital\nrecruiting tools. These tools offer a smart and effective way to stay in\nthe fight during such a crisis. As we all know, our mission is too\nimportant to the veterans and families we serve to not push forward.\nHowever, doing so smartly, without risking anyone's health in the\nprocess, is the goal.</p>\n\n<p>To continue advancing our cause and promoting policies that ensure\nveterans and their families can live with respect and dignity, DAV and\nits members must evolve with the times and use every available resource\nat our disposal.</p>\n\n<p>We work hard each day to find new and innovative ways to help our\nrecruiters in the field. Today, DAV continues to evolve on social media,\nand DAV members are leveraging technology to continue to play vital\nroles as spokespeople for the unique requirements of veterans and their\nloved ones. One way DAV has evolved is the online membership\napplication. Since nearly everyone has a smartphone, nearly everyone has\na membership application within arm's reach.</p>\n\n<p>This technology provides us with the mobility and flexibility to\nintroduce anyone at any time to DAV and the value of being a member.</p>\n\n<p>One of our more recent recruitment initiatives--and one we're\nexcited to continue--is the Recruit a Warrior program. It is designed to\nhelp our members reach as many veterans as possible.</p>\n\n<p>To participate, all you have to do is follow these two simple\nsteps:</p>\n\n<p>1. Enter your email address at <a href=\"http://dav.org/warrior\">dav.org/warrior</a> to receive your\npersonalized referral link.</p>\n\n<p>2. Share your referral link with fellow warriors. This link is\nunique to you and will automatically track how many new members\nyou've recruited.</p>\n\n<p>We understand the challenges veterans face, and that is why, when\nspeaking with a potential member, we must illustrate the whole picture\nof DAV's mission and services. From securing earned benefits and\nproviding transportation to operating an employment program and\nsupporting volunteer initiatives, DAV helps veterans and gives us the\nopportunity to serve in meaningful ways.</p>\n\n<p>We can work smarter and not harder if we, as an organization,\ndevelop good habits and utilize the tools available to us.</p>\n\n<p>From the NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP DIRECTOR <person>DOUGLAS K. WELLS JR</person>.</p>",
