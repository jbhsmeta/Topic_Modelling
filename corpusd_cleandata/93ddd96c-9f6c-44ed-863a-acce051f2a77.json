    "text": "Folks gathered at the Citizens Service Center all with one common goal which\nis to fight back against racial injustice. The organizer says he understands\npeople are upset and angry and they have every right to be, but if you want\nchange you need to cast a ballot.\n\nEarly voting is underway here in Muscogee County. On the ballot are candidates\nvying for positions on the local , state and national levels. Marquese Averett\nis the organizer of the rally.\n\nAverett says all of this is nothing new, folks have been protesting and\nmarching for years. He says he organized this rally to bring folks together to\nsay yes Black Lives Matter, but your ballot is your voice.\n\n\"I think that it's more important for us to put people in office that think\nlike us. Thinking like us is we should not have to beg you to say Black Lives\nMatter, we should not have to beg you to come out and speak about the\nconditions of the African American community,\" Avarett said.\n\nAvarett says during the rally folks will be able to share any experiences they\nmay have had with police brutality or racial injustice. They are also\nproviding masks and hand sanitizers to ensure everyone's safety during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfterwards they say they plan to get in line to vote.",

They are also providing masks and hand sanitizers to ensure everyone's safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards they say they plan to get in line to vote.</p>",
