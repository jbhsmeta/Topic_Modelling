    "text": "A three-year anniversary might not seem like a milestone to many businesses.\nFor married couples, the traditional three-year anniversary gift is leather,\nwhich is symbolic of the marriage reaching a stage of flexible durability.\n\nBut for a $3 billion manufacturing plant that has made history on several\nlevels, it's a big deal.\n\nThe Iowa Fertilizer Company (IFCo) has marked three years of operations and is\nnow a couple months into its fourth year.\n\nAnd, it's historic in that the plant is the first greenfield world-scale\nnitrogen fertilizer plant built in the United States in nearly 30 years.\n\nFor Iowa, the building of the plant involved the largest tax incentive in Iowa\nhistory \u0096 $109 million in tax subsidies and incentives. In addition to the\nstate financial incentives, the company was given local breaks from Lee\nCounty, including $133 million in tax abatements over a 20-year period. It\nalso qualified for federal tax-exempt bonds worth an estimated $300 million.\n\nThe groundbreaking and ribbon cutting ceremony for the Wever plant was held in\nthe fall of 2012. The plant was expected to cost $1.8 billion and be running\nby fall 2015. A tough first winter got the project off to a slow start, and\nchanging engineering and construction companies in April 2015 also threw a\nwrench in the progress of production.\n\nWhere there any other surprises? Yes, but the major ones were of a positive\nnature, according to IFC Managing Director Darrell Allman and Plant Manager\nRobb Aultman.\n\n\"Not really surprises. With a project of this magnitude, for a $3 billion\nproject, there were no big surprises, just a lot of little things requiring a\nlot of effort and a lot of sleepless nights,\" Allman said. \"Best of all, the\ntargets were exceeded and were 10 to 17% higher than the early numbers. Now,\nthat was a pleasant surprise.\"\n\nIFCo is one of the largest nitrogen fertilizer plants in the U.S. and uses\nworld recognized proven state-of-the-art production process technologies.\n\nThe plant employs just under 250 people and operates 24/7, 7 days a week, 365\ndays a year.\n\nIt produces ammonia, granular urea, and UAN, in addition to diesel exhaust\nfluid, a fuel additive used to lower harmful nitrogen oxide emissions and\nimprove fuel economy. The facility's design provides significant flexibility\nin determining the relative production amounts of its various nitrogen\nproducts and therefore allows IFCo to maximize production to swing products in\nresponse to changes in the market.\n\nOriginally, the plant was to employ about 175 full-time workers, but Allman\nsaid they soon learned that adding people would add to safety measures.\n\n\"We realized we needed to have more people to have more eyes and ears around,\"\nAllman added.\n\nThe additional staff also allowed IFC officials to streamline production and\nget their products out of the plant and ready for delivery to clients much\nfaster.\n\nGreatest Asset is Its Workforce\n\nAllman said the plant constantly met its daily output goals of 4,750 tons of\nliquid UAN; 1,320 tons of granular urea; 2,425 tons of ammonia; and 990 tons\nof diesel exhaust fluid.\n\nAllman said training and reaching these daily targets takes an average of 5\nyears at most plants, but that points to what Allman and Aultman say is the\nWever plant's greatest asset \u0096 its workforce.\n\n\"It was the dedication of the team. Most were Southeast Iowa residents that we\nhired. The employees learned how to run the plant with ingenuity and\nteamwork,\" Allman said. \"There may have been a bit of cushion in some of the\nnumbers, not knowing for sure what to expect, but these people have exceeded\nwhere we hoped to be in three years.\"\n\n\"To learn the chemistry, heat and combine balance factors, to be able to do\nthat in 3 years is a real feat,\" Aultman added. \"I have to say we have some of\nthe best workers, with the best work ethic around.\"\n\nAultman says that this work ethic was never more evident that in recent months\nduring the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and state shutdowns. Because IFCo\nproducts are connected to the nation's food supply and agriculture, it was\ndeemed an essential operation. There was no shutdown for IFCo.\n\n\"We are critical to the food supply and our workers showed up every day. Those\nthat couldn't work from home, which was most of the production team, were\nthere without hesitation,\" Aultman said.\n\nAultman said IFCo continues to screen each employee entering the work site;\nhas increased its cleaning protocols; requires all at the plant to wear facial\nmasks; and conducts deep cleaning between crew changes.\n\n\"And we practice social distancing, and have rearranged break rooms.\"\n\nTurnaround Boosts Area Businesses\n\nBecause the plant runs 24/7, each and every day of the year, Allman said it\nneeds to conduct \"a turnaround\" for maintenance and upgrades every three to\nfour years. One of those turnarounds was held in 2019 when the plant shut down\nfrom July 6 through early August. This routine maintenance period, which is\ncalled a \"turnaround,\" allows for the inspection of the plant's equipment and\nnecessary repairs as part of the company's longstanding commitment to the\nsafety of the facility, employees, and the community at large, including the\nprotection of the surrounding environment. Turnarounds also ensure reliable\nand efficient production at or above required capacities through the next\nseveral years of continuous operation.\n\nThe turnaround last summer also employed 500 to 600 new temporary workers\nonsite and involved a total investment of approximately $30 million that\nsupported numerous local businesses throughout Lee and Des Moines Counties.\n\nCommunity Outreach\n\nIn addition to reaching its production targets and being a major employer in\nthe area, IFCo is often in the news supporting local projects and causes. It\nhas raised funds to provide coats to children in need each winter; helped\npurchase equipment for volunteer fire departments; supported Fort Madison's\nfireworks display each year; stocked the shelves of local food pantries and\nmore. Most recently, IFCo provided meals for workers at Fort Madison Community\nHospital and UnityPoint-Keokuk.\n\nBut Aultman said this community outreach is driven by IFCo employees more than\nthe company.\n\n\"We listen to employees about what they want to do, and where they see a need.\nIf it's important to them, it is to us,\" Aultman said.\n\nSafety & Environment\n\nAllman says he is equally proud of the plant's safety record and its\ncommitment to protecting the environment.\n\n\"We'll stand our safety record against anyone in the business,\" he said. \"And\nas far as the environment, we have the cleanest footprint of any of this type\nof industry. We have exceeded the DNR's expectations.\"\n\nThat environment-friendly stance will continue in the future. Allman says IFCo\nrecycles its water now and plans a $13 million investment to improve its\nenvironment-friendly efforts.",

    "html": "<p>A three-year anniversary might not seem like a milestone to many businesses. For married couples, the traditional three-year anniversary gift is leather, which is symbolic of the marriage reaching a stage of flexible durability.</p>\n<p>But for a <money>$3 billion</money> manufacturing plant that has made history on several levels, it's a big deal.</p>\n\n<p>The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4224409275\">Iowa Fertilizer Company</org> (IFCo) has marked three years of operations and is now a couple months into its fourth year.</p>\n\n<p>And, it's historic in that the plant is the first greenfield world-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant built in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> in nearly 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>For <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location>, the building of the plant involved the largest tax incentive in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location> history &#150; <money>$109 million</money> in tax subsidies and incentives. In addition to the state financial incentives, the company was given local breaks from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.lee\">Lee County</location>, including <money>$133 million</money> in tax abatements over a 20-year period. It also qualified for federal tax-exempt bonds worth an estimated <money>$300 million</money>.</p>\n\n<p>The groundbreaking and ribbon cutting ceremony for the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.wever\">Wever</location> plant was held in the fall of 2012. The plant was expected to cost <money>$1.8 billion</money> and be running by fall 2015. A tough first winter got the project off to a slow start, and changing engineering and construction companies in <chron>April 2015</chron> also threw a wrench in the progress of production.</p>\n\n<p>Where there any other surprises? Yes, but the major ones were of a positive nature, according to IFC Managing Director <person>Darrell Allman</person> and Plant Manager <person>Robb Aultman</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Not really surprises. With a project of this magnitude, for a <money>$3 billion</money> project, there were no big surprises, just a lot of little things requiring a lot of effort and a lot of sleepless nights,\" Allman said. \"Best of all, the targets were exceeded and were 10 to 17% higher than the early numbers. Now, that was a pleasant surprise.\"</p>\n\n<p>IFCo is one of the largest nitrogen fertilizer plants in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> and uses world recognized proven state-of-the-art production process technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The plant employs just under 250 people and operates 24/7, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.</p>\n\n<p>It produces ammonia, granular urea, and UAN, in addition to diesel exhaust fluid, a fuel additive used to lower harmful nitrogen oxide emissions and improve fuel economy. The facility's design provides significant flexibility in determining the relative production amounts of its various nitrogen products and therefore allows IFCo to maximize production to swing products in response to changes in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, the plant was to employ about 175 full-time workers, but Allman said they soon learned that adding people would add to safety measures.</p>\n\n<p>\"We realized we needed to have more people to have more eyes and ears around,\" Allman added.</p>\n\n<p>The additional staff also allowed IFC officials to streamline production and get their products out of the plant and ready for delivery to clients much faster.</p>\n\n<p>Greatest Asset is Its Workforce</p>\n\n<p>Allman said the plant constantly met its daily output goals of 4,750 tons of liquid UAN; 1,320 tons of granular urea; 2,425 tons of ammonia; and 990 tons of diesel exhaust fluid.</p>\n\n<p>Allman said training and reaching these daily targets takes an average of 5 years at most plants, but that points to what Allman and Aultman say is the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.wever\">Wever</location> plant's greatest asset &#150; its workforce.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was the dedication of the team. Most were <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Southeast Iowa</location> residents that we hired. The employees learned how to run the plant with ingenuity and teamwork,\" Allman said. \"There may have been a bit of cushion in some of the numbers, not knowing for sure what to expect, but these people have exceeded where we hoped to be in three years.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"To learn the chemistry, heat and combine balance factors, to be able to do that in 3 years is a real feat,\" Aultman added. \"I have to say we have some of the best workers, with the best work ethic around.\"</p>\n\n<p>Aultman says that this work ethic was never more evident that in recent months during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and state shutdowns. Because IFCo products are connected to the nation's food supply and agriculture, it was deemed an essential operation. There was no shutdown for IFCo.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are critical to the food supply and our workers showed up every day. Those that couldn't work from home, which was most of the production team, were there without hesitation,\" Aultman said.</p>\n\n<p>Aultman said IFCo continues to screen each employee entering the work site; has increased its cleaning protocols; requires all at the plant to wear facial masks; and conducts deep cleaning between crew changes.</p>\n\n<p>\"And we practice social distancing, and have rearranged break rooms.\"</p>\n\n<p>Turnaround Boosts Area Businesses</p>\n\n<p>Because the plant runs 24/7, each and every day of the year, Allman said it needs to conduct \"a turnaround\" for maintenance and upgrades every three to four years. One of those turnarounds was held in 2019 when the plant shut down from <chron>July 6</chron> through early August. This routine maintenance period, which is called a \"turnaround,\" allows for the inspection of the plant's equipment and necessary repairs as part of the company's longstanding commitment to the safety of the facility, employees, and the community at large, including the protection of the surrounding environment. Turnarounds also ensure reliable and efficient production at or above required capacities through the next several years of continuous operation.</p>\n\n<p>The turnaround last summer also employed 500 to 600 new temporary workers onsite and involved a total investment of approximately <money>$30 million</money> that supported numerous local businesses throughout <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.lee\">Lee</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.desmns\">Des Moines</location> Counties.</p>\n\n<p>Community Outreach</p>\n\n<p>In addition to reaching its production targets and being a major employer in the area, IFCo is often in the news supporting local projects and causes. It has raised funds to provide coats to children in need each winter; helped purchase equipment for volunteer fire departments; supported <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.forson\">Fort Madison's</location> fireworks display each year; stocked the shelves of local food pantries and more. Most recently, IFCo provided meals for workers at <org>Fort Madison Community Hospital</org> and UnityPoint-Keokuk.</p>\n\n<p>But Aultman said this community outreach is driven by IFCo employees more than the company.</p>\n\n<p>\"We listen to employees about what they want to do, and where they see a need. If it's important to them, it is to us,\" Aultman said.</p>\n\n<p>Safety &amp; Environment</p>\n\n<p>Allman says he is equally proud of the plant's safety record and its commitment to protecting the environment.</p>\n\n<p>\"We'll stand our safety record against anyone in the business,\" he said. \"And as far as the environment, we have the cleanest footprint of any of this type of industry. We have exceeded the <org>DNR's</org> expectations.\"</p>\n\n<p>That environment-friendly stance will continue in the future. Allman says IFCo recycles its water now and plans a <money>$13 million</money> investment to improve its environment-friendly efforts.</p>",
