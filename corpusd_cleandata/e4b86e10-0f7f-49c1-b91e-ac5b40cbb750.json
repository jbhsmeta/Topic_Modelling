    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer News\nToday -- Investigators publish new report on Science - Computer Science.\nAccording to news reporting originating in Islamabad, Pakistan, by NewsRx\njournalists, research stated, \"Identification of relevant documents is\nperformed to keep track of the state-of-the-art methods and relies on research\npaper recommender systems. The proposed approaches for these systems can be\nclassified into categories like content-based, collaborative filtering-based,\nand bibliographic information-based approaches.\"\n\nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Capital\nUniversity of Science & Technology, \"The content-based approaches exploit the\nfull text of articles and provide more promising results than other\napproaches. However, most content is not freely available because of\nsubscription requirements. Therefore, the scope of content-based approaches is\nlimited. In such scenarios, the best possible alternative could be the\nexploitation of other openly available resources. Therefore, this research\nexplores the possible use of metadata and bibliographic information to find\nrelated articles. The approach incorporates metadata with co-citations to find\nand rank related articles against a query paper. The similarity score of\nmetadata fields is calculated and combined with co-citations. The proposed\napproach is evaluated on a newly constructed dataset of 5116 articles. The\nbenchmark ranking against each co-cited document set is established by\napplying Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and results are evaluated with the\nstate-of-the-art content-based approach in terms of normalized discounted\ncumulative gain (NDCG). The state-of-the-art content-based approach achieved\nan NDCG score of 0.86 while the traditional co-citation-based approach scored\n0.72. The presented method achieved NDCG scores of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.78 by\nincorporating the title, co-citation and title, and abstract, respectively,\nwhereas the highest NDCG score of 0.77 was achieved by combining co-citations\nwith metadata. However, better results are achieved by incorporating the title\nand abstract with NDCG score of 0.81.\"\n\nAccording to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Therefore, it can be\nconcluded that the proposed approach could be a better alternative in cases\nwhere content is unavailable.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Combining metadata and co-citations\nfor recommending related papers. _TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING &\nCOMPUTER SCIENCES_, 2020;28(3):1519-1534. _TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL\nENGINEERING & COMPUTER SCIENCES_ can be contacted at: Tubitak Scientific &\nTechnical Research Council Turkey, Ataturk Bulvari No 221, Kavaklidere,\nAnkara, 00000, Turkey.\n\nOur news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by\ncontacting S.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at Computer News Today -- Investigators publish new report on Science - Computer Science. According to news reporting originating in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/pk..islbad\">Islamabad, Pakistan</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Identification of relevant documents is performed to keep track of the state-of-the-art methods and relies on research paper recommender systems. The proposed approaches for these systems can be classified into categories like content-based, collaborative filtering-based, and bibliographic information-based approaches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1295423318\">Capital University</org> of Science &amp; Technology, &#8220;The content-based approaches exploit the full text of articles and provide more promising results than other approaches. However, most content is not freely available because of subscription requirements. Therefore, the scope of content-based approaches is limited. In such scenarios, the best possible alternative could be the exploitation of other openly available resources. Therefore, this research explores the possible use of metadata and bibliographic information to find related articles. The approach incorporates metadata with co-citations to find and rank related articles against a query paper. The similarity score of metadata fields is calculated and combined with co-citations. The proposed approach is evaluated on a newly constructed dataset of 5116 articles. The benchmark ranking against each co-cited document set is established by applying Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and results are evaluated with the state-of-the-art content-based approach in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). The state-of-the-art content-based approach achieved an NDCG score of 0.86 while the traditional co-citation-based approach scored 0.72. The presented method achieved NDCG scores of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.78 by incorporating the title, co-citation and title, and abstract, respectively, whereas the highest NDCG score of 0.77 was achieved by combining co-citations with metadata. However, better results are achieved by incorporating the title and abstract with NDCG score of 0.81.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news reporters, the research concluded: &#8220;Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed approach could be a better alternative in cases where content is unavailable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Combining metadata and co-citations for recommending related papers. <em>TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING &amp; COMPUTER SCIENCES</em>, 2020;28(3):1519-1534. <em>TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING &amp; COMPUTER SCIENCES</em> can be contacted at: Tubitak Scientific &amp; Technical Research Council Turkey, Ataturk Bulvari No 221, Kavaklidere, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/tr..ankara\">Ankara</location>, 00000, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/tr\">Turkey</location>.</p>\n<p>Our news correspondents report that additional information may be obtained by contacting <person>S.
