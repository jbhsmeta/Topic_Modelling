The grant will provide 10 stipends to high school students to\nexperience eight weeks of intense laboratory exposure along with professional\nand career development activities. The SHARE program will bring prospective\nstudents to campus and serve as a recruitment initiative for the medical\nschool.\n\nThe stipends will allow the students to focus on research projects and receive\nmentorship at a time when many young people divert their attention from\nscholastic endeavors to a part-time job.\n\n\"Students often miss out on valuable educational opportunities like this\nbecause they have to work,\" said Rajendram Rajnarayanan, NYITCOM at A-State\nassistant dean of research. \"The Kays Foundation is investing in these\nstudents to give them this unique opportunity, and we can't thank them enough\nfor doing so.\"\n\nThe SHARE program launched in 2019, and plans are underway to alter the format\nto allow much of the curriculum to be delivered virtually in light of the\nongoing global health crisis. Students who participated in the 2019 program\nremain connected with NYITCOM at A-State as many continue to work with their\nmentors and receive guidance as they participate in science fairs and\ncompetition.",

The grant will provide 10 stipends to high school students to experience eight weeks of intense laboratory exposure along with professional and career development activities. The SHARE program will bring prospective students to campus and serve as a recruitment initiative for the medical school.</p>\n\n<p>The stipends will allow the students to focus on research projects and receive mentorship at a time when many young people divert their attention from scholastic endeavors to a part-time job.</p>\n\n<p>\"Students often miss out on valuable educational opportunities like this because they have to work,\" said Rajendram Rajnarayanan, NYITCOM at A-State assistant dean of research. \"<org>The Kays Foundation</org> is investing in these students to give them this unique opportunity, and we can't thank them enough for doing so.\"</p>\n\n<p>The SHARE program launched in 2019, and plans are underway to alter the format to allow much of the curriculum to be delivered virtually in light of the ongoing global health crisis. Students who participated in the 2019 program remain connected with NYITCOM at A-State as many continue to work with their mentors and receive guidance as they participate in science fairs and competition.</p>",
