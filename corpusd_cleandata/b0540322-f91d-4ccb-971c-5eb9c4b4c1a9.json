    "text": "KILREA United chairman Davy Shiels has revealed the club have been\n\"overwhelmed and humbled\" by the generosity of the public which has saved the\nvillage team after being hit with a Fifa fine of 10,000 Swiss francs.\n\nIn an emotional interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Shiels thanked all those\nwho donated to a GoFundMe page set up to help the club, adding that the\nColeraine and District League outfit now plan to assist Lisburn League youth\nside TW Braga, who were rocked by the same punishment from world football's\ngoverning body last month. The Sunday Life broke the story at the weekend that\non May 18 Fifa's Disciplinary Committee ordered Kilrea to pay almost \u00a38,500\nfor fielding an unregistered player last season.\n\nThey were told that they had 30 days to pay the fine and with no right of\nappeal under Fifa regulations, they feared the club would go out of existence\nas the Co Londonderry side were voluntary run and had no funds. There were\npassionate pleas to help from Coleraine striker Eoin Bradley, who trains the\namateur club, and Larne owner Kenny Bruce which gave modest Kilrea officials\nthe push to ask for donations.\n\nHaving set up the GoFundMe page late on Wednesday night they had surpassed\ntheir goal of \u00a38,500 before yesterday afternoon and by 6pm incredibly had\nraised over \u00a312,000.\n\nChairman Shiels said: \"The response has been overwhelming and very humbling.\nPeople from every walk of life have donated and we want to thank everyone that\nhas helped us.\"\n\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 36 had hit \u00a33,000 and I swear to God there was a tear in my\neye thinking about the generous nature of people.\n\n\"When I turned on my phone on Thursday morning there was message after message\nand call after call and people were even coming to my house to donate money to\nour club.\n\n\"We are grateful and thankful for everything.\"\n\nFifa take a serious view on the registration of young players and\ninternational clearance. Kilrea had been punished by the all-powerful body for\nplaying unregistered English teenager Pierce Hill-Worrall (above) in the\nlatter part of the 2018/2019 campaign. TW Braga were also stunned to land the\nsame fine after Fifa investigated the registration of the club's former\nforward from New York, 17-year-old Hassan Ayari who is now with Sheffield\nUnited and considered to have a bright future.\n\nThe Lisburn League outfit have set up their own GoFundMe page to help with\ntheir fine.\n\nShiels said: \"We will do what we can to help TW Braga because, like us, they\nhave found themselves in a difficult situation.\n\n\"We have gone over the target that we set so we will hold discussions within\nour club about giving a donation to TW Braga and also about giving money to a\nlocal charity.\"\n\nFOOTBALL FROM BACK PAGE Shiels added: \"This means a lot to the people in the\ntown and we will never forget it.\n\n\"It means we can pay the Fifa fine and survive.\n\n\"It is heart-warming that so many people wanted to help Kilrea United Football\nClub.\n\n\"We spoke with Eoin (Bradley) on Wednesday night and he told us about the\nLarne owner Kenny Bruce saying on Twitter that he was going to make a donation\nto ourselves and TW Braga.\n\n\"That's what triggered us setting up a GoFundMe page.\n\n\"We really appreciated Kenny's kind gesture and from there the reaction has\nbeen unreal.\n\n\"On Wednesday night I sat up to just before midnight and we",
