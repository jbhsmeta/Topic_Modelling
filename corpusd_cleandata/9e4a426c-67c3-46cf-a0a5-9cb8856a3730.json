    "text": "Arsonists, looters and rioters who think they evaded U.S. law enforcement this\npast week because they wore face masks might be in for a surprise.\n\nNot long after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended\nwearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19, a company\nintroduced face recognition technology designed to identify people who are\nwearing masks, be it to ward off coronavirus or conceal their identities while\ncommitting crimes.\n\nBrendan Klare, co-founder and CEO of Rank One Computing in Denver, said his\ncompany's new technology \"can be deployed with our law enforcement partners\"\nthat include 25 agencies in the United States.\n\n![Brendan Klare, co-founder and CEO of Rank One\nComputing.](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/presto/2020/06/04/USAT/eaf60f0e-88d6-40d8-b061-e3374d6fd4bd-\nBrendanKlare-03.jpg)\n\n\"What we have released in direct response to COVID is what we call periocular\nrecognition algorithm,\" Klare told USA TODAY. \"It's very similar to a face\nrecognition algorithm. It's just the eyes and eyebrows only. So obviously it\nworks with masks.\"\n\nWell, not so obviously.\n\n  * A Florida sheriff well known for his use of face recognition technology expressed doubts about the claims.\n  * A U.S. government study of the new technology has been delayed.\n  * And in the wake of a white police officer killing George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis, the discussion about law enforcement's use of face recognition technology has been renewed.\n\n\"Nobody has answered the question of how they can assure that this technology\ndoesn't contribute to existing police abuses,\" said Neema Guliani, senior\nlegislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). \"Until you\nanswer that question, I think the notion that this is technology that can be\nused by law enforcement is pretty concerning.\"\n\n**Protesters lament violence:**[Peaceful protesters lament violence at George\nFloyd demonstrations, but understand the rage behind\nit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/05/31/george-floyd-protests-does-\nviolence-muddy-focus-police-brutality/5292403002/)\n\n**Should we ban face recognition?:**[Should we ban facial recognition?

Hutchinson said NEC, based in Japan, and the\ntwo other leading biometrics technology companies collectively have contracts\nwith each of the states.\n\n![A protester smashes a window at the CNN center Friday May 29, 2020 in\nAtlanta.

But he said he thinks the number is \"very\nfew,\" in part, because of associated costs.\n\n![Sheriff and chairperson, Bob Gualtieri, of Pinellas County, Fla., speaks\nduring a state commission meeting as they investigate the Marjory Stoneman\nDouglas High School massacre and how Broward school district and others access\nthreats on Tuesday, July 10, 2018, in Sunrise, Fla.](https://www.gannett-\ncdn.com/media/2018/07/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636669063788935550-AP-School-\nShooting-Florida.jpg)\n\n**Why is the ACLU so concerned about this, and what's the argument in favor of\nlaw enforcement using the technology?**\n\n\"Think about the reality of what that means for people attending protests,\"\nsaid Guliani of the ACLU. \"That means that they have to fear that they will be\nidentified by law enforcement in situations where we've already seen police\nviolence targeted at peaceful protesters.\n\n\"It means that they have to worry about being identified by law enforcement\nwhen many people rightfully have extreme distrust about how that will affect\ntheir lives and whether that will lead to further abuse.\"\n\nHutchinson, the NEC executive who has been working in the industry for 15\nyears, said privacy concerns are legitimate.\n\n\"Surveillance is the hot button topic with live video cameras and streaming\nalgorithms that are detecting and matching faces in real time,\" he said. \"And\nthat use is not widely deployed, if at all, in the United States. And that's\nimportant to know.\"\n\n## What's with the Big Brother talk?\n\nThere are no federal laws or regulations governing law enforcement's use of\nface recognition technology, and that seems to have fueled speculation about\nhow the face recognition technology system works.\n\n\"They think there's cameras on every corner and it's all connected and there's\na giant computer and that's just not the case,\" Hutchinson said.\n\nOr as Klare of Rank One Computing said of the conjecture he hears, \"Like, you\nwalk by a camera and law enforcement comes and nabs you like a robot. That is\nnot how it's done.\"\n\n**So how is it done?**\n\n\"A lot of times the best images we get are residences or businesses that have\ncamera systems and somebody's committed a crime and they provide with you a\nvideo system,\" said Gualtieri, the sheriff from Pinellas County in Florida.\n\"Then will put those into facial recognition and see if you get a match.\"\n\nThe evidence is not admissible in a court of law but it can help identify\npeople as part of an investigation, Gualtieri said.\n\nBut privacy concerns persist due to the likes of Clearview AI, a company that\nhas touted its facial recognition software and a database of three billion\nimages scraped from the internet. In January, the New York Times reported that\nClearview claimed more than 600 law enforcement agencies had begun using the\ncompany's services in the past year.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are expected to be limited to searching government\nphotos such as driver's licenses photos and mugshots of convicted criminals as\nopposed to photos posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and other social\nmedia sites from which Clearview says it collects photos.\n\nLast month, the ACLU sued Clearview AI and said the lawsuit was designed \"to\nbring an end to the company's unlawful, privacy-destroying surveillance\nactivities.\"\n\nIn a news release, the ACLU added, \"Clearview claims that, through this\nenormous database, it can instantaneously identify the subject of a photograph\nwith unprecedented accuracy, enabling covert and remote surveillance of\nAmericans on a massive scale.\"\n\n**Are criminals going to get away with crimes, in part, because the face masks\nthey 're wearing will thwart face recognition software?**\n\nAmong the top authorities is Anil Jain, a professor at Michigan State and well\nrespected in the field of face recognition technology.\n\n\"It all depends on what portion of the face is being covered,\" he said.\n\"Sometimes it might have a shadow appear on your eyes. Eyes are very\nimportant. Eyes are the most important views in face recognition. In fact,\neven from a social perspective, reading a person's eyes, it's same thing for\nalgorithm.\n\n\"So using eyes alone, you can do 75% of the job. Provided the person is not\nwearing sunglasses or anything.\"\n\nBut criminals have been wearing masks long before the coronavirus crisis hit,\nand Gualtieri said he knows what to do when face recognition technology isn't\neffective for catching criminals.\n\n\"You just got to go back to the old-school way,\" he said\n\n_This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: [Do coronavirus masks provide\nprotest\nprotection?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/05/coronavirus-\nmasks-protests-identity-protection/3124657001/)_",

But he said he thinks the number is &#8220;very few,\" in part, because of associated costs.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Sheriff and chairperson, Bob Gualtieri, of Pinellas County, Fla., speaks during a state commission meeting as they investigate the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre and how Broward school district and others access threats on Tuesday, July 10, 2018, in Sunrise, Fla.\" id=\"36782453\" src=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/07/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636669063788935550-AP-School-Shooting-Florida.jpg\" style=\"width: 650px;\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Why is the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4121658453\">ACLU</org> so concerned about this, and what&#8217;s the argument in favor of law enforcement using the technology?</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Think about the reality of what that means for people attending protests,\" said Guliani of the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4121658453\">ACLU</org>. &#8220;That means that they have to fear that they will be identified by law enforcement in situations where we&#8217;ve already seen police violence targeted at peaceful protesters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It means that they have to worry about being identified by law enforcement when many people rightfully have extreme distrust about how that will affect their lives and whether that will lead to further abuse.\"</p>\n<p>Hutchinson, the NEC executive who has been working in the industry for 15 years, said privacy concerns are legitimate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Surveillance is the hot button topic with live video cameras and streaming algorithms that are detecting and matching faces in real time,\" he said.  &#8220;And that use is not widely deployed, if at all, in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location>. And that&#8217;s important to know.\"</p>\n<p />\n<h2 class=\"presto-h2\">What&#8217;s with the Big Brother talk?</h2>\n<p>There are no federal laws or regulations governing law enforcement&#8217;s use of face recognition technology, and that seems to have fueled speculation about how the face recognition technology system works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They think there&#8217;s cameras on every corner and it&#8217;s all connected and there&#8217;s a giant computer and that&#8217;s just not the case,\" Hutchinson said.</p>\n<p>Or as Klare of Rank One Computing said of the conjecture he hears, \"Like, you walk by a camera and law enforcement comes and nabs you like a robot. That is not how it&#8217;s done.\"</p>\n<p><strong>So how is it done?</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of times the best images we get are residences or businesses that have camera systems and somebody&#8217;s committed a crime and they provide with you a video system,\" said Gualtieri, the sheriff from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.fl.pinlas\">Pinellas County</location> in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.fl\">Florida</location>. &#8220;Then will put those into facial recognition and see if you get a match.\"</p>\n<p>The evidence is not admissible in a court of law but it can help identify people as part of an investigation, Gualtieri said.</p>\n<p>But privacy concerns persist due to the likes of Clearview AI, a company that has touted its facial recognition software and a database of three billion images scraped from the internet. In January, the New York Times reported that Clearview claimed more than 600 law enforcement agencies had begun using the company's services in the past year.</p>\n<p />\n<p>Law enforcement agencies are expected to be limited to searching government photos such as driver's licenses photos and mugshots of convicted criminals as opposed to photos posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and other social media sites from which Clearview says it collects photos.</p>\n<p>Last month, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4121658453\">ACLU</org> sued Clearview AI and said the lawsuit was designed &#8220;to bring an end to the company&#8217;s unlawful, privacy-destroying surveillance activities.\"</p>\n<p>In a news release, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:4121658453\">ACLU</org> added, \"Clearview claims that, through this enormous database, it can instantaneously identify the subject of a photograph with unprecedented accuracy, enabling covert and remote surveillance of Americans on a massive scale.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Are criminals going to get away with crimes, in part, because the face masks they&#8217;re wearing will thwart face recognition software?</strong></p>\n<p>Among the top authorities is <person>Anil Jain</person>, a professor at Michigan State and well respected in the field of face recognition technology.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It all depends on what portion of the face is being covered,\"  he said. &#8220;Sometimes it might have a shadow appear on your eyes. Eyes are very important. Eyes are the most important views in face recognition. In fact, even from a social perspective, reading a person&#8217;s eyes, it&#8217;s same thing for algorithm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So using eyes alone, you can do 75% of the job. Provided the person is not wearing sunglasses or anything.\"</p>\n<p>But criminals have been wearing masks long before the coronavirus crisis hit, and Gualtieri said he knows what to do when face recognition technology isn't effective for catching criminals.</p>\n<p>\"You just got to go back to the old-school way,\" he said</p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <org>USA TODAY</org>: <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/05/coronavirus-masks-protests-identity-protection/3124657001/\">Do coronavirus masks provide protest protection?</a></em></p>\n<p />",
