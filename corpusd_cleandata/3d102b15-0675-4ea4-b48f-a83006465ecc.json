    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Respiratory\nTherapeutics Daily News \\-- Fresh data on pharyngitis are presented in a new\nreport. According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China,\nby NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Relieving Sore Throat Formula (RSTF)\nis a formula approved by the China Food and Drug Administration and has been\nused for the treatment of pharyngitis in clinic for many years. However, the\npotential pharmacological mechanism still remains unknown.\"\n\nFunders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina.\n\nThe news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing University\nof Chinese Medicine: \"We combined multiple methods including bioinformatics\ndata digging, network pharmacology analysis, and pathway analysis to predict\nthe potential target of RSTF. We verified our in silico prediction results\nwith an in vivo/vitro antibacterial effect test, mouse phagocytic index test,\nproliferation, transformation, and migration of mouse spleen lymphocytes.\nAlteration of NF-kB pathway was determined by Western blotting,\nimmunofluorescence, and PCR. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the\nRSTF could significantly relieve the symptoms of pharyngitis. A rat saliva\nsecretion test showed that RSTF can effectively relieve the xerostomia\nsymptom. A phenol red excretion test showed that RSTF has an eliminating\nphlegm effect. A hot plate method and granuloma experiment proved that RSTF\nalso have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. In silico prediction\ndemonstrates that 70 active compounds of RSTF were filtered out through ADME\nscreening and 84 putative targets correlated with different diseases. Pathway\nenrichment analysis showed that the candidate targets were mostly related to\nthe response to bacteria and immunity signalling pathways, which are known\ncontributors to pharyngitis.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Experimental results\nconfirmed that RSTF exerted therapeutic effects on pharyngitis mainly by\nantibacterial effect and downregulation of NF-kB activities. It is\ndemonstrated both in silico and in vivo/vitro that RSTF exerted therapeutic\neffects on pharyngitis mainly through an antibiotic effect and downregulation\nof NF-kB signalling pathway.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: Relieving Sore Throat Formula\nExerts a Therapeutic Effect on Pharyngitis through Immunoregulation and NF-kB\nPathway. _Mediators of Inflammation_ , 2020,2020.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Respiratory Therapeutics Daily News</org> -- Fresh data on pharyngitis are presented in a new report. According to news reporting from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..nanjng\">Nanjing</location>, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, &#8220;Relieving Sore Throat Formula (RSTF) is a formula approved by the <org>China Food and Drug Administration</org> and has been used for the treatment of pharyngitis in clinic for many years. However, the potential pharmacological mechanism still remains unknown.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Funders for this research include <org>National Natural Science Foundation</org> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.</p>\n<p>The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0029141694\">Nanjing University</org> of Chinese Medicine: &#8220;We combined multiple methods including bioinformatics data digging, network pharmacology analysis, and pathway analysis to predict the potential target of RSTF. We verified our in silico prediction results with an in vivo/vitro antibacterial effect test, mouse phagocytic index test, proliferation, transformation, and migration of mouse spleen lymphocytes. Alteration of NF-kB pathway was determined by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and PCR. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the RSTF could significantly relieve the symptoms of pharyngitis. A rat saliva secretion test showed that RSTF can effectively relieve the xerostomia symptom. A phenol red excretion test showed that RSTF has an eliminating phlegm effect. A hot plate method and granuloma experiment proved that RSTF also have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. In silico prediction demonstrates that 70 active compounds of RSTF were filtered out through ADME screening and 84 putative targets correlated with different diseases. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the candidate targets were mostly related to the response to bacteria and immunity signalling pathways, which are known contributors to pharyngitis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Experimental results confirmed that RSTF exerted therapeutic effects on pharyngitis mainly by antibacterial effect and downregulation of NF-kB activities. It is demonstrated both in silico and in vivo/vitro that RSTF exerted therapeutic effects on pharyngitis mainly through an antibiotic effect and downregulation of NF-kB signalling pathway.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: Relieving Sore Throat Formula Exerts a Therapeutic Effect on Pharyngitis through Immunoregulation and NF-kB Pathway. <em>Mediators of Inflammation</em>, 2020,2020.
