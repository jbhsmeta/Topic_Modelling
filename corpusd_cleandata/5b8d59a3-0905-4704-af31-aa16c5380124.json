    "text": "2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China\nNews \\-- New research on Science - Atmospheric Science is the subject of a\nreport. According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of\nChina, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The importance of a\nnational or regional network of meteorological stations for improving weather\npredictions has been recognized for many years. Ground-based automatic weather\nstations typically observe weather at a height of 2-10 m above ground level\n(AGL); however, these observations may have two major shortcomings.\"\n\nOur news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, \"Large portions of data cannot be used if the station\nheight is significantly lower than the model surface level; and such\nobservations may contain large representativity errors as near-surface\nobservations are often affected by the local environment, such as nearby\nbuildings and tall trees. With the recent introduction of a significant number\nof mobile communication towers that are typically over 40 m AGL in China, a\ncampaign has been proposed to use such towers to build a future observing\nsystem with an observing height of 40 m. A series of observing system\nsimulation experiments has been conducted to assess the potential utility of\nsuch a future observing system as part of a feasibility study. The experiments\nwere conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model and its Rapid\nUpdate Cycle data assimilation system. The results revealed the possibility of\nimproving weather forecasting by raising present weather stations to a height\nof 40 m; this would not only enable more observations to pass the terrain\ncheck, but should also reduce interpolation errors.\"\n\nAccording to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally,\nimprovements for temperature, humidity and wind forecasting could be achieved\nas the accuracy of the initial conditions increases.\"\n\nFor more information on this research see: An Observing System Simulation\nExperiment to Assess the Potential Impact of a Virtual Mobile Communication\nTower-based Observation Network on Weather Forecasting Accuracy in China.

    "html": "<p>2020 JUN 05 (NewsRx) -- By a <org>News Reporter-Staff News</org> Editor at <org>Daily China News</org> -- New research on Science - Atmospheric Science is the subject of a report. According to news originating from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/cn..beijng\">Beijing</location>, People&#8217;s <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">Republic of China</location>, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, &#8220;The importance of a national or regional network of meteorological stations for improving weather predictions has been recognized for many years. Ground-based automatic weather stations typically observe weather at a height of 2-10 m above ground level (AGL); however, these observations may have two major shortcomings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2519186135\">Chinese Academy of Sciences</org>, &#8220;Large portions of data cannot be used if the station height is significantly lower than the model surface level; and such observations may contain large representativity errors as near-surface observations are often affected by the local environment, such as nearby buildings and tall trees. With the recent introduction of a significant number of mobile communication towers that are typically over 40 m AGL in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>, a campaign has been proposed to use such towers to build a future observing system with an observing height of 40 m. A series of observing system simulation experiments has been conducted to assess the potential utility of such a future observing system as part of a feasibility study. The experiments were conducted using the <org>Weather Research</org> and Forecasting model and its Rapid Update Cycle data assimilation system. The results revealed the possibility of improving weather forecasting by raising present weather stations to a height of 40 m; this would not only enable more observations to pass the terrain check, but should also reduce interpolation errors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the news editors, the research concluded: &#8220;Additionally, improvements for temperature, humidity and wind forecasting could be achieved as the accuracy of the initial conditions increases.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more information on this research see: An Observing System Simulation Experiment to Assess the Potential Impact of a <location>Virtual Mobile Communication Tower</location>-based Observation Network on Weather Forecasting Accuracy in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location>.
