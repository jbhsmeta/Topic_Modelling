    "text": "PLEASANT PRAIRIE \\- The future of the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant that closed\nin 2018 remains uncertain.\n\nBut plans for whatever will happen there are in the works.\n\nDuring a brief Pleasant Prairie Village Board meeting held virtually June 1,\nAdministrator Nathan Thiel said staff members recently met with officials from\nWe Energies to lay out a timeline and discuss possibilities for the site.\n\nThe plant, located in the 8000 block of 95th Street, covers 570 acres and\nstretches north to State Highway 50.\n\nPermits should be secured soon, Thiel said, with demolition beginning in July.\nThe project should be completed next December.\n\nFrom there, it is expected that We Energies will begin looking at developments\nand possible land sales on the property. Thiel said the company plans to\nretain about 80 acres for its substation and transmission lines and sell the\nrest.\n\n\"Currently, they don't have any specific land buyer or developers,\" Thiel\nsaid. \"But they are actively soliciting and will be taking inquiries regarding\nthat property.\"\n\nThiel said on the village side of things, future roadways, connections and\nother issues were discussed. Another meeting is planned for the fall.\n\nThe power plant went into service in 1980, and since then was one of the\nbiggest coal-fired power plants in the region, burning 13,000 to 13,600 tons\nof coal every day. A decade ago, We Energies invested $325 million in\npollution controls at the plant. At the time, the utility estimated that the\nplant would operate through 2055.\n\nThiel said a virtual open house for the proposed downtown development, the\nVillage Green Center, is in the works for June 25.\n\nThe village's downtown community hub is being designed by architectural firm\nand design collective, Rinka, which is based in Milwaukee.\n\n\"We're hoping to conduct it similar to some of the larger public hearings\nwe've held,\" Thiel said. \"We plan to get that advertised and out to the public\nthis week.\"\n\nThe proposed Village Green Center mixed-use development consists of about 180\nacres, generally located at Springbrook Road, 39th Avenue and Highway 165.\n\nConceptual planning for Village Green Center was facilitated during a seven-\nmonth period with collaboration from about 60 community members. Those\ninvolved focused on eight integral themes to create a common vision for the\nfuture downtown.\n\n21 vintage ads from 1955Check out this collection of 21 vintage ads from 1955.\n\n21 vintage ads from 1955Check out this collection of 21 vintage ads from 1955.",

    "html": "<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.plerie\">PLEASANT PRAIRIE</location> - The future of the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant that closed in 2018 remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>But plans for whatever will happen there are in the works.</p>\n\n<p>During a brief <org>Pleasant Prairie Village Board</org> meeting held virtually <chron>June 1</chron>, Administrator <person>Nathan Thiel</person> said staff members recently met with officials from <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"OTC-PINK:WELPM\">We Energies</org> to lay out a timeline and discuss possibilities for the site.</p>\n\n<p>The plant, located in the 8000 block of <location>95th Street</location>, covers 570 acres and stretches north to <location>State Highway 50</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Permits should be secured soon, Thiel said, with demolition beginning in July. The project should be completed next December.</p>\n\n<p>From there, it is expected that <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"OTC-PINK:WELPM\">We Energies</org> will begin looking at developments and possible land sales on the property. Thiel said the company plans to retain about 80 acres for its substation and transmission lines and sell the rest.</p>\n\n<p>\"Currently, they don't have any specific land buyer or developers,\" Thiel said. \"But they are actively soliciting and will be taking inquiries regarding that property.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thiel said on the village side of things, future roadways, connections and other issues were discussed. Another meeting is planned for the fall.</p>\n\n<p>The power plant went into service in 1980, and since then was one of the biggest coal-fired power plants in the region, burning 13,000 to 13,600 tons of coal every day. A decade ago, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"OTC-PINK:WELPM\">We Energies</org> invested <money>$325 million</money> in pollution controls at the plant. At the time, the utility estimated that the plant would operate through 2055.</p>\n\n<p>Thiel said a virtual open house for the proposed downtown development, the Village Green Center, is in the works for <chron>June 25</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>The village's downtown community hub is being designed by architectural firm and design collective, Rinka, which is based in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wi.milkee\">Milwaukee</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"We're hoping to conduct it similar to some of the larger public hearings we've held,\" Thiel said. \"We plan to get that advertised and out to the public this week.\"</p>\n\n<p>The proposed Village Green Center mixed-use development consists of about 180 acres, generally located at <location>Springbrook Road</location>, <location>39th Avenue</location> and <location>Highway 165</location>.</p>\n\n<p>Conceptual planning for Village Green Center was facilitated during a seven-month period with collaboration from about 60 community members. Those involved focused on eight integral themes to create a common vision for the future downtown.</p>\n\n<p>21 vintage ads from 1955Check out this collection of 21 vintage ads from 1955.</p>\n\n<p>21 vintage ads from 1955Check out this collection of 21 vintage ads from 1955.</p>",
