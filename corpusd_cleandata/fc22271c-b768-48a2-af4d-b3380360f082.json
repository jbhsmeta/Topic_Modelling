    "text": "Bringing history to life and imparting that knowledge on the next generation\nhas fueled Olivia Simpson's ambition for years.\n\nThe Park Hills student's dreams will become reality this month when she\nofficially claims the title of \"teacher\" after completing her degree at\nSoutheast Missouri State University.\n\n\"Graduating from Southeast has been a dream of mine since seventh grade,\"\nSimpson said. \"I came with a college prep course in middle school to the\nSoutheast campus and immediately fell in love. It feels like one of my\ngreatest dreams has come true from graduating as a teacher from Southeast.\"\n\nSimpson, of Park Hills, will graduate from Southeast with a bachelor's degree\nin education, secondary education, social studies emphasis. Beginning this\nAugust, she will teach American and world history at Malden High School.\n\n\"I have wanted to be an educator since I was little. I saw the impact teachers\nhad on students and I wanted to contribute to that,\" Simpson said. \"I love\nhelping people and have always loved history so I felt it was my life mission\nto pass my knowledge on to people.\"\n\nExperiences in and out of classroom at Southeast have helped to prepare her\nfor a teaching career. Her professors in the Department of History and the\nDepartment of Leadership, Middle and Secondary Education have gone above and\nbeyond to shape her as a student and person, Simpson said.\n\n\"They care about each student and want to see us succeed wholeheartedly,\" she\nsaid. \"They are so passionate about history. When you're surrounded by people\nwho love what they do, it solidifies that what you want to do is the right\npath.\"\n\nSoutheast also provided her the opportunity to live in the Secondary Scholars\nLearning Community, where they could share their common academic interests. As\na freshman, Simpson connected with fellow education majors, faculty and\nadvisors, and participated in special study sessions focused on success in the\neducation curriculum.\n\nSimpson was also an active member of Southeast's Secondary Social Studies\nEducators Association which allowed her to learn from other students, engage\nwith faculty and take part in one-on-one communication with professionals.\n\n\"We had many adventures in Chicago learning from the best in the business,\"\nshe said.\n\nOne of the greatest highlights of her time at Southeast was a two-week study\nabroad trip to the Bavarian Alps where students immersed in the new culture\nand enjoyed excursions throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n\"It was not only educational but life-changing as well,\" she said. \"It gave me\nfirst-hand experience in the local history and how it has influenced the\nentire world. I hope to apply my experience with my students to show them and\nencourage to always take advantage of traveling.\"\n\nSimpson also hopes to help her future students connect history with current\nevents.\n\n\"Social studies are such a wide topic that everything we do involves social\nstudies in some way,\" she said. \"I think it's important to know our history to\nbe able to make informed decisions about our future. I was influenced by\namazing teachers throughout my educational career that have shaped that.\"\n\nSimpson is looking forward to starting her new career at Malden High School.\nIn addition to teaching American and World History, she will also be assisting\nin History Day in Missouri and with the Scholar Bowl Team.\n\n\"What excites me the most about the career I've chosen is it's always evolving\nand changing,\" Simpson added. \"We are living in historic times as we speak,\nand I get to have the chance to teach my students about that. I'm excited to\nshare my interest in both world and local history with my students and\nhopefully encourage many to find what they are truly passionate about. I truly\nam thankful to be a part of such a loving and welcoming school district and\ncannot wait to begin.\"",

    "html": "<p>Bringing history to life and imparting that knowledge on the next generation has fueled <person>Olivia Simpson's</person> ambition for years.</p>\n<p><location>The Park Hills</location> student's dreams will become reality this month when she officially claims the title of \"teacher\" after completing her degree at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0950956112\">Southeast Missouri State University</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Graduating from Southeast has been a dream of mine since seventh grade,\" Simpson said. \"I came with a college prep course in middle school to the Southeast campus and immediately fell in love. It feels like one of my greatest dreams has come true from graduating as a teacher from Southeast.\"</p>\n\n<p>Simpson, of <location>Park Hills</location>, will graduate from Southeast with a bachelor's degree in education, secondary education, social studies emphasis. Beginning this August, she will teach American and world history at <org>Malden High School</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"I have wanted to be an educator since I was little. I saw the impact teachers had on students and I wanted to contribute to that,\" Simpson said. \"I love helping people and have always loved history so I felt it was my life mission to pass my knowledge on to people.\"</p>\n\n<p>Experiences in and out of classroom at Southeast have helped to prepare her for a teaching career. Her professors in the <org>Department of History</org> and the <org>Department of Leadership, Middle and Secondary Education</org> have gone above and beyond to shape her as a student and person, Simpson said.</p>\n\n<p>\"They care about each student and want to see us succeed wholeheartedly,\" she said. \"They are so passionate about history. When you're surrounded by people who love what they do, it solidifies that what you want to do is the right path.\"</p>\n\n<p>Southeast also provided her the opportunity to live in the <org>Secondary Scholars Learning Community</org>, where they could share their common academic interests. As a freshman, Simpson connected with fellow education majors, faculty and advisors, and participated in special study sessions focused on success in the education curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>Simpson was also an active member of <org>Southeast's Secondary Social Studies Educators Association</org> which allowed her to learn from other students, engage with faculty and take part in one-on-one communication with professionals.</p>\n\n<p>\"We had many adventures in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.il.chicgo\">Chicago</location> learning from the best in the business,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>One of the greatest highlights of her time at Southeast was a two-week study abroad trip to the Bavarian Alps where students immersed in the new culture and enjoyed excursions throughout <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/at\">Austria</location>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It was not only educational but life-changing as well,\" she said. \"It gave me first-hand experience in the local history and how it has influenced the entire world. I hope to apply my experience with my students to show them and encourage to always take advantage of traveling.\"</p>\n\n<p>Simpson also hopes to help her future students connect history with current events.</p>\n\n<p>\"Social studies are such a wide topic that everything we do involves social studies in some way,\" she said. \"I think it's important to know our history to be able to make informed decisions about our future. I was influenced by amazing teachers throughout my educational career that have shaped that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Simpson is looking forward to starting her new career at <org>Malden High School</org>. In addition to teaching American and World History, she will also be assisting in History Day in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mo\">Missouri</location> and with the Scholar Bowl Team.</p>\n\n<p>\"What excites me the most about the career I've chosen is it's always evolving and changing,\" Simpson added. \"We are living in historic times as we speak, and I get to have the chance to teach my students about that. I'm excited to share my interest in both world and local history with my students and hopefully encourage many to find what they are truly passionate about. I truly am thankful to be a part of such a loving and welcoming school district and cannot wait to begin.\"</p>",
