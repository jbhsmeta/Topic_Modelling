    "text": "ASHLAND -- Passing cars honked in support. More than 30 demonstrators of all\nages held their homemade signs high.\n\nKeon Singleton, the protest organizer, spoke through a megaphone to drivers\nstopped at Main Street and Claremont Avenue.\n\nA large contingent supporting Black Lives Matter continued to make themselves\nseen and heard downtown on Monday for the fourth straight day. Participants\nsaid their numbers pushed 100 over the weekend.\n\nSingleton plans for peaceful protests to continue from 1 to 3 p.m. daily until\nthere is a \"revolution\" in this country and black Americans are treated the\nsame as white Americans.\n\nHe refused to talk to a reporter about his efforts, and he discouraged other\nprotesters Monday from speaking unless the reporter held a sign and took part\nin the rally.\n\nProtests have swept the country for nearly two weeks since the Memorial Day\ndeath of George Floyd, a black man killed while in Minneapolis police custody.\nDemonstrations didn't start in Ashland until Thursday, when Singleton, an\nAshland University student, marched on Main Street downtown with a handmade\nsign. On Friday, the movement kicked off in earnest with more than 50\nindividuals joining him.\n\nThe community has been mostly supportive, said Rebecca Shaw, an Ashland woman\nwho attended demonstrations Saturday through Monday her 3-year-old and 5-year-\nold children and her girlfriend. A few passersby over the weekend yelled\nthings like \"all lives matter\" and \"Trump 2020,\" Shaw said.\n\nAshland City Police Officer Kara Pearce joined the demonstration on Sunday and\nheld a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign. Pearce did not return a phone message or\nemail seeking comment Monday.\n\n\"We are proud and thankful that our local community has chosen to demonstrate\npeacefully,\" said Ashland City Police Chief David Marcelli in an emailed\nstatement.\n\n\"Members of the Division are free to participate in demonstrations or not\nparticipate as they choose,\" he said, noting, \"I have received a number of\npositive comments concerning Pearce's appearance at the demonstration.\"\n\nMark Gorsuch, a Mapleton High School and Ashland University graduate, said on\nhis first day protesting Monday that he plans to come back every day this\nweek.\n\n\"Ashland is considered sometimes a backward town where civil rights aren't\nreally emphasized, and I want to show that our community is one that values\ncivil rights, too,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the 2010 U.S. Census, less than 2% of the city of Ashland's\napproximately 20,000 residents and fewer than 1% of Ashland County's roughly\n50,000 residents are black. When asked about the number of minority officers\non city police staff, Marcelli said the department does not ask applicants\nabout \"race, creed, national origin, or religion.\"\n\n\"We currently have three female officers, the most at any time in our\nhistory,\" he noted.\n\nComing together\n\nProtester Alexis Thomas acknowledged that racism exists in small towns like\nAshland, where people \"need to come together.\"\n\nAn Ashland native attending Kent State University, Thomas held a sign that\nread \"racism is a pandemic too,\" when she attended demonstrations on Saturday\nand Monday. She said she wants to participate whenever she can.\n\nWhile loud protests will continue, a group of local young adults is planning a\nvigil for victims of police brutality to be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday at\nBrookside West Park.\n\nHannah Caram, an Ashland native and University of Findlay student who is among\nthe organizers, said the event is not a demonstration against any police\nofficers or the Ashland City Police Department. The event's Facebook page\nnotes, \"we welcome any officers who wish to bow their heads with us.\"\n\n\"This event is to support black voices, and it is our responsibility to\nlisten, learn, and use our privilege to lift up black communities, especially\nwithin Ashland,\" Caram said. The vigil will honor \"the lives that we've lost\nand will shed light on them. People will say their names and be more educated\nabout their stories.\"\n\nAt the vigil, Rev. Wilson Arimi will lead participants in prayer and Columbus-\nbased political activist Latyna M. Humphrey will speak about unity. Attendees\nare encouraged to social distance, wear masks and bring water.\n\nReach Jordan at 419-281-0581 ext. 240 or [jlaird@times-\ngazette.com](mailto:jlaird@times-gazette.com).

More than 30 demonstrators of all ages held their homemade signs high.</p>\n<p><person>Keon Singleton</person>, the protest organizer, spoke through a megaphone to drivers stopped at <location>Main Street</location> and <location>Claremont Avenue</location>.</p>\n\n<p>A large contingent supporting <org>Black Lives Matter</org> continued to make themselves seen and heard downtown on Monday for the fourth straight day. Participants said their numbers pushed 100 over the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Singleton plans for peaceful protests to continue from <chron>1 to 3 p.m.</chron> daily until there is a \"revolution\" in this country and black Americans are treated the same as white Americans.</p>\n\n<p>He refused to talk to a reporter about his efforts, and he discouraged other protesters Monday from speaking unless the reporter held a sign and took part in the rally.</p>\n\n<p>Protests have swept the country for nearly two weeks since the <chron>Memorial Day</chron> death of <person>George Floyd</person>, a black man killed while in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police custody. Demonstrations didn't start in Ashland until Thursday, when Singleton, an <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2589630801\">Ashland University</org> student, marched on <location>Main Street</location> downtown with a handmade sign. On Friday, the movement kicked off in earnest with more than 50 individuals joining him.</p>\n\n<p>The community has been mostly supportive, said <person>Rebecca Shaw</person>, an Ashland woman who attended demonstrations Saturday through Monday her 3-year-old and 5-year-old children and her girlfriend. A few passersby over the weekend yelled things like \"all lives matter\" and \"Trump 2020,\" Shaw said.</p>\n\n<p><org>Ashland City Police</org> Officer <person>Kara Pearce</person> joined the demonstration on Sunday and held a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign. Pearce did not return a phone message or email seeking comment Monday.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are proud and thankful that our local community has chosen to demonstrate peacefully,\" said <org>Ashland City Police</org> Chief <person>David Marcelli</person> in an emailed statement.</p>\n\n<p>\"Members of the Division are free to participate in demonstrations or not participate as they choose,\" he said, noting, \"I have received a number of positive comments concerning Pearce's appearance at the demonstration.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Mark Gorsuch</person>, a <org>Mapleton High School</org> and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:2589630801\">Ashland University</org> graduate, said on his first day protesting Monday that he plans to come back every day this week.</p>\n\n<p>\"Ashland is considered sometimes a backward town where civil rights aren't really emphasized, and I want to show that our community is one that values civil rights, too,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>According to the 2010 <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Census, less than 2% of the city of Ashland's approximately 20,000 residents and fewer than 1% of Ashland County's roughly 50,000 residents are black. When asked about the number of minority officers on city police staff, Marcelli said the department does not ask applicants about \"race, creed, national origin, or religion.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We currently have three female officers, the most at any time in our history,\" he noted.</p>\n\n<p>Coming together</p>\n\n<p>Protester <person>Alexis Thomas</person> acknowledged that racism exists in small towns like Ashland, where people \"need to come together.\"</p>\n\n<p>An Ashland native attending <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1934888545\">Kent State University</org>, Thomas held a sign that read \"racism is a pandemic too,\" when she attended demonstrations on Saturday and Monday. She said she wants to participate whenever she can.</p>\n\n<p>While loud protests will continue, a group of local young adults is planning a vigil for victims of police brutality to be held at <chron>7 p.m. Tuesday</chron> at <location>Brookside West Park</location>.</p>\n\n<p><person>Hannah Caram</person>, an Ashland native and <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1404065390\">University of Findlay</org> student who is among the organizers, said the event is not a demonstration against any police officers or the <org>Ashland City Police Department</org>. The event's Facebook page notes, \"we welcome any officers who wish to bow their heads with us.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"This event is to support black voices, and it is our responsibility to listen, learn, and use our privilege to lift up black communities, especially within Ashland,\" Caram said. The vigil will honor \"the lives that we've lost and will shed light on them. People will say their names and be more educated about their stories.\"</p>\n\n<p>At the vigil, Rev. Wilson Arimi will lead participants in prayer and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.colbus\">Columbus</location>-based political activist <person>Latyna M. Humphrey</person> will speak about unity.
