    "text": "It was a line of signs in black, white and red that Cynthia Rodriguez has\nbrought out for more than eight years, since Trayvon Martin was fatally shot.\n\n\"Hands up! Don't shoot!\"\n\n\"End the abuse now\"\n\n\"They've seen a lot of rallies,\" said Rodriguez, who was wearing a fabric face\nmask with \"No justice, no peace\" written on it Thursday afternoon in the plaza\nbetween Bethlehem City Hall and the public library.\n\nThe Allentown resident was there as part of the Black Lives Matter protest\nagainst police brutality, held five days after a similar peaceful protest\nmarched through the city.\n\nHundreds of black-clad participants, many carrying signs, filled the plaza on\nthe sunny and warm afternoon, and then listened to organizers speak on\ncombating police brutality and racism, and using the movement for positive\nchange in the future.\n\nAs organizers spoke, loud chants of \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"No justice no\npeace\" and \"George Floyd,\" reverberated between the buildings and could be\nheard from blocks away in the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nHundreds assembled at the same time Thursday afternoon as Allentown hosted its\nsecond passionate but peaceful protest against racism and police violence\ntargeting people of color.\n\nOrganizer Darian Colbert drew a connection between the route, from Allentown\nPublic Library to Lehigh County Prison, and the pipeline that too many black\nand brown people find themselves in.\n\n\"We started off at the library - education - ended at the prison - mass\nincarceration,\" he said outside the jail near Hamilton and North Fourth\nstreets. \"You wonder why we're saying shut it down? Because listen to me: We\nwere declaring, speaking and prophesying right now: Tear this system down.\n\n\"Tear it down. The school-to-prison pipeline, say, \u0091Tear it down!'\"\n\nGeorge Floyd's killing was a central theme at both protests, and signs\nreferenced his death after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin placed a\nknee on his neck for 8 minutes 46 seconds.\n\nChauvin and three other officers from the Minneapolis Police Department were\nfired.\n\nChauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in\nFloyd's death, but on Wednesday a second-degree murder charge was added\nagainst Chauvin and the three other officers - Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J.\nAlexander Kueng \\- were charged with aiding and abetting murder.\n\nBethlehem protest organizer Kennedy Hughes began listing the death toll,\nstarting with Botham Jean, then Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Eric Harris, Philando\nCastile and Ahmaud Arbery.\n\nWhen she finished talking about Floyd, people in the crowd shouted more names,\nincluding Breonna Taylor and Mike Brown.\n\n\"What needs to be said goes beyond just today, this week, or even this month.\nOne of\n\nmy greatest fears is that after the social media posts and the protests slow\ndown, and we go back to work, and after the world returns to somewhat normal,\nthe majority of America will be silent again until another murder is caught on\nfilm,\" organizer Joshua Smith, 27, told the crowd. \"That can't happen.\"\n\nSmith said he wanted to be able to feel safe in his own country.\n\n\"I'm tired of my skin color being taken as a threat before someone even knows\nmy character. I'm tired of me and black bothers and sisters being pulled over\nbecause our skin color creates suspicious activity,\" he said.\n\nCyndria Pugh, an organizer from Montgomery County, read the rules of police\nofficers' use of force, which ends with killing a suspect. \"Why is that the\nfirst one they go to?\" she asked, as someone in the crowd yelled, \"I can't\nbreathe!\"\n\nOrganizer Sydney Duffy, who is from Bethlehem, spoke of the \"sacrifice\" white\npeople will need to make to combat racism in their own lives. \"There will be\ntimes where you may lose friendships or family relationships due to the\nignorance that they choose to pursue,\" she said, later adding, \"Fight for what\nmatters. Fight for justice. Fight for their human rights.\"\n\nThe speakers urged support for black businesses, for the crowd to educate\nthemselves on black art and culture, and to give space to and amplify black\nvoices.\n\nThey touched on improving mental heath resources and funding, establishing a\ncivil review board for misconduct in local police departments, and for the\nBethlehem Area School District to end its use of city police as school\nresource officers.\n\n\"We need healing from the trauma America has inflicted upon us for hundreds of\nyears. This is not - is not - an issue that can be solved overnight. At all,\"\nMatty Fall said. \"We will be doing this for years to come, and years after,\nand we're going to keep working toward it until we see the results we want to\nsee. It's an ongoing process and we have to keep on working at it, and I hope\nit really doesn't stop here.\"\n\nThe protest comes a day after Bethlehem Police Chief Mark DiLuzio released a\nstatement that he was horrified at \"the callous actions of the police officer\nkneeling on Mr. Floyd's neck\" and the inaction of the three other police\nofficers. He also denounced looting and violence at nationwide protests.\n\nOrganizer Michael Henriquez urged attendees to look at their relationships,\nwith family and friends and at their jobs.\n\n\"It's time to break the silence. ... it is always an appropriate time to call\nout racism,\" he said. \"No one is free until everyone, including black lives,\nare free.\"\n\nFor those who stay silent, who ignore cries from the black community, \"you\nhave as much blood on your hands as the offenders,\" Henriquez said. \"We are\nthe change America needs to see. We are the future.\"\n\nIn Allentown, Colbert, who is executive director of the grassroots community\norganizing group Cohesion Network, spent part of the morning with city Police\nChief Glenn Granitz Jr. on a virtual town hall. Beginning at 3 p.m., Granitz\nand other officers were among those marching down Hamilton.\n\n\"This is not something that was begun today,\" Colbert said during the morning\nsession carried on Facebook. \"This is something, this is a man that I have\nbeen honored to call my friend and this is a man that I have worked together\non a lot of the issues that are in front of our country.\"\n\nGranitz said: \"That's one thing that I think the community needs to understand\nhere, that the building of trust, the building of understanding begins with\nempathy, it begins with our police officers understanding where people's\nfrustrations or people's anger comes from, so listening is a big part of this\nfor me.\"\n\nGranitz was careful to point out during the town hall that he and Colbert were\nsocially distancing themselves, 6 feet apart, as the coronavirus pandemic\ncontinues to infect people in the Lehigh Valley and beyond.\n\nParticipants in the rally and march tended to bunch closer together, and\nthough many wore masks, some lowered them as the heat of the June afternoon\nbore down.\n\nThe demonstration was sparked by the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor in\nLouisville as well as Floyd at the hands of police, and countless people of\ncolor who were victimized by police brutality before them.\n\nThe marchers shouted out the names of Taylor and Floyd, amid chants of \"Black\nlives matter,\" and \"What do we want? Justice. When do want it? Now. If we\ndon't get it? Shut it down!\"\n\n\"We are responsible for the atrocities happening to our black brothers and\nsisters because of our inaction and our inability to stand united,\" said\nYolanda Diaz Colbert, who is Colbert's wife. They live in Allentown.\n\n\"We must say no more,\" she continued in a speech outside the library. \"Our\nsilence and inaction allow the death of black brothers and sisters and the\nmurderers, free, are still on the job.",

    "html": "<p>It was a line of signs in black, white and red that <person>Cynthia Rodriguez</person> has brought out for more than eight years, since <person>Trayvon Martin</person> was fatally shot.</p>\n<p>\"Hands up! Don't shoot!\"</p>\n\n<p>\"End the abuse now\"</p>\n\n<p>\"They've seen a lot of rallies,\" said Rodriguez, who was wearing a fabric face mask with \"No justice, no peace\" written on it Thursday afternoon in the plaza between <location>Bethlehem City Hall</location> and the public library.</p>\n\n<p>The Allentown resident was there as part of the <org>Black Lives Matter</org> protest against police brutality, held five days after a similar peaceful protest marched through the city.</p>\n\n<p>Hundreds of black-clad participants, many carrying signs, filled the plaza on the sunny and warm afternoon, and then listened to organizers speak on combating police brutality and racism, and using the movement for positive change in the future.</p>\n\n<p>As organizers spoke, loud chants of \"<org>Black Lives Matter</org>,\" \"No justice no peace\" and \"<person>George Floyd</person>,\" reverberated between the buildings and could be heard from blocks away in the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>Hundreds assembled at the same time Thursday afternoon as Allentown hosted its second passionate but peaceful protest against racism and police violence targeting people of color.</p>\n\n<p>Organizer <person>Darian Colbert</person> drew a connection between the route, from <org>Allentown Public Library</org> to <location>Lehigh County Prison</location>, and the pipeline that too many black and brown people find themselves in.</p>\n\n<p>\"We started off at the library - education - ended at the prison - mass incarceration,\" he said outside the jail near Hamilton and North Fourth streets. \"You wonder why we're saying shut it down? Because listen to me: We were declaring, speaking and prophesying right now: Tear this system down.</p>\n\n<p>\"Tear it down. The school-to-prison pipeline, say, &#145;Tear it down!'\"</p>\n\n<p><person>George Floyd's</person> killing was a central theme at both protests, and signs referenced his death after <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer <person>Derek Chauvin</person> placed a knee on his neck for 8 minutes 46 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Chauvin and three other officers from the <org>Minneapolis Police Department</org> were fired.</p>\n\n<p>Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death, but on Wednesday a second-degree murder charge was added against Chauvin and the three other officers - <person>Tou Thao</person>, <location>Thomas Lane</location> and <person>J. Alexander Kueng</person> - were charged with aiding and abetting murder.</p>\n\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ps..bethem\">Bethlehem</location> protest organizer <person>Kennedy Hughes</person> began listing the death toll, starting with Botham Jean, then <person>Eric Garner</person>, <person>Tamir Rice</person>, <person>Eric Harris</person>, <person>Philando Castile</person> and <person>Ahmaud Arbery</person>.</p>\n\n<p>When she finished talking about Floyd, people in the crowd shouted more names, including <person>Breonna Taylor</person> and <person>Mike Brown</person>.</p>\n\n<p>\"What needs to be said goes beyond just today, this week, or even this month. One of</p>\n\n<p>my greatest fears is that after the social media posts and the protests slow down, and we go back to work, and after the world returns to somewhat normal, the majority of America will be silent again until another murder is caught on film,\" organizer <person>Joshua Smith</person>, 27, told the crowd. \"That can't happen.\"</p>\n\n<p>Smith said he wanted to be able to feel safe in his own country.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm tired of my skin color being taken as a threat before someone even knows my character. I'm tired of me and black bothers and sisters being pulled over because our skin color creates suspicious activity,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p><person>Cyndria Pugh</person>, an organizer from Montgomery County, read the rules of police officers' use of force, which ends with killing a suspect. \"Why is that the first one they go to?\" she asked, as someone in the crowd yelled, \"I can't breathe!\"</p>\n\n<p>Organizer <person>Sydney Duffy</person>, who is from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ps..bethem\">Bethlehem</location>, spoke of the \"sacrifice\" white people will need to make to combat racism in their own lives. \"There will be times where you may lose friendships or family relationships due to the ignorance that they choose to pursue,\" she said, later adding, \"Fight for what matters. Fight for justice. Fight for their human rights.\"</p>\n\n<p>The speakers urged support for black businesses, for the crowd to educate themselves on black art and culture, and to give space to and amplify black voices.</p>\n\n<p>They touched on improving mental heath resources and funding, establishing a civil review board for misconduct in local police departments, and for the <org>Bethlehem Area School District</org> to end its use of city police as school resource officers.</p>\n\n<p>\"We need healing from the trauma America has inflicted upon us for hundreds of years. This is not - is not - an issue that can be solved overnight. At all,\" Matty Fall said. \"We will be doing this for years to come, and years after, and we're going to keep working toward it until we see the results we want to see. It's an ongoing process and we have to keep on working at it, and I hope it really doesn't stop here.\"</p>\n\n<p>The protest comes a day after <org>Bethlehem Police</org> Chief <person>Mark DiLuzio</person> released a statement that he was horrified at \"the callous actions of the police officer kneeling on <person>Mr. Floyd's</person> neck\" and the inaction of the three other police officers. He also denounced looting and violence at nationwide protests.</p>\n\n<p>Organizer <person>Michael Henriquez</person> urged attendees to look at their relationships, with family and friends and at their jobs.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's time to break the silence. ... it is always an appropriate time to call out racism,\" he said. \"No one is free until everyone, including black lives, are free.\"</p>\n\n<p>For those who stay silent, who ignore cries from the black community, \"you have as much blood on your hands as the offenders,\" Henriquez said. \"We are the change America needs to see. We are the future.\"</p>\n\n<p>In Allentown, Colbert, who is executive director of the grassroots community organizing group Cohesion Network, spent part of the morning with city Police Chief <person>Glenn Granitz Jr</person>. on a virtual town hall. Beginning at <chron>3 p.m.</chron>, Granitz and other officers were among those marching down Hamilton.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is not something that was begun today,\" Colbert said during the morning session carried on Facebook. \"This is something, this is a man that I have been honored to call my friend and this is a man that I have worked together on a lot of the issues that are in front of our country.\"</p>\n\n<p>Granitz said: \"That's one thing that I think the community needs to understand here, that the building of trust, the building of understanding begins with empathy, it begins with our police officers understanding where people's frustrations or people's anger comes from, so listening is a big part of this for me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Granitz was careful to point out during the town hall that he and Colbert were socially distancing themselves, 6 feet apart, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to infect people in the <location>Lehigh Valley</location> and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Participants in the rally and march tended to bunch closer together, and though many wore masks, some lowered them as the heat of the June afternoon bore down.</p>\n\n<p>The demonstration was sparked by the recent deaths of <person>Breonna Taylor</person> in Louisville as well as Floyd at the hands of police, and countless people of color who were victimized by police brutality before them.</p>\n\n<p>The marchers shouted out the names of Taylor and Floyd, amid chants of \"Black lives matter,\" and \"What do we want? Justice. When do want it? Now. If we don't get it? Shut it down!\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We are responsible for the atrocities happening to our black brothers and sisters because of our inaction and our inability to stand united,\" said <person>Yolanda Diaz Colbert</person>, who is Colbert's wife. They live in Allentown.</p>\n\n<p>\"We must say no more,\" she continued in a speech outside the library. \"Our silence and inaction allow the death of black brothers and sisters and the murderers, free, are still on the job.</p>",
