    "text": "Passing through East Canton and heading toward Minerva in Stark County,\ndrivers along the Lincoln Highway are treated to slices of pastoral beauty and\nthe occasional relic barn with a Mail Pouch advertisement.\n\nNear Robertsville, the stretch of curves and bends offers a detour from the\nbyway onto Baywood Street SE.\n\nTires roll over an ancient brick stretch of the fabled artery -- distinguished\nas the country's first transcontinental highway, from New York City to San\nFrancisco.\n\nThe automotive stroll is an example of the many scenic byways and routes\ncrossing the state map.\n\nAnd as Ohio continues to reopen businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic,\ntraffic is rising as evidenced by numbers from the Ohio Department of\nTransportation.\n\n\"My family and I and some other friends of ours .. we've been going out and\ndoing scenic drives,\" said Jim Cassler, of Canton. \"The Lincoln Highway is a\ngreat place to go.\n\n\"You can see the old brick stretches,\" said Cassler, who serves on the board\nof directors for the Ohio Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor.\n\n\"There's a stretch north of Mansfield and also in Upper Sandusky, so there's a\nnumber of brick stretches you can visit, and there is a short section, Sylvan\nRoad, in Wooster.\"\n\nODOT spokesman Matt Bruning said the overall driving spike isn't a surprise.\nIt's expected to continue unless there's a setback or backtracking on health-\nrelated restrictions.\n\nAfter traffic numbers \"bottomed out\" in mid-April, \"we're starting to see a\nvery slow but steady rebound,\" said Bruning, the agency's press secretary.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nStatewide traffic data reflects the tightening and easing of the stay-at-home\norder issued near the end of March by Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\nFrom March 15 to 21, statewide traffic decreased 30 percent compared to a year\nearlier, with Northeast Ohio registering a 31 percent dip.\n\nA plunge was recorded from March 22 to 28, with traffic down 46 percent, both\nacross Ohio and in the Canton-Akron region.\n\nTraffic patterns held steady here and elsewhere on average until peaking at a\nroughly 49 percent weekly decrease from April 5 to 11, according to ODOT.\n\nThe numbers show a cause and effect: As salons, restaurants, offices, retail\nstores and other businesses continue to open, Ohioans are getting behind the\nwheel more frequently.\n\n\"We're slowly ticking back to normal levels where we would expect to be,\"\nBruning said.\n\n\"How will it look three months from now or six months from now until a year\nfrom now, it's anybody's guess,\" he added. \"This is certainly an unprecedented\ntime.\"\n\nScenic drives\n\nPractical transportation, however, isn't the only function of Ohio's roads.\nThere's a rich network of historic routes and eye-pleasing byways, Bruning\nnoted.\n\n\"I have a family of five,\" he said. \"... It is not uncommon for us to jump in\nthe car and enjoy some of the scenery.\"\n\nAdvising that residents should follow the pandemic-related directives of\nDeWine and state health officials, Bruning said, that \"as long as you're being\nsafe, (road trips are) a great way to see and learn something about the\nstate.\"\n\nHere's a a handful of Ohio's most scenic routes:\n\nLincoln Highway: Representing the first roadway system in support of cars, the\nLincoln was conceived in 1913 as the first highway from the Atlantic to the\nPacific.\n\nThe Lincoln Highway Historic Byway (240 miles in Ohio) follows the final\nalignment adopted in 1928, linking the cities of Canton, Massillon, Wooster,\nMansfield, Bucyrus, Upper Sandusky, Delphos and Van Wert.\n\nHeritage Corridors of Bath: Connecting 19th century hamlets with the Hale Farm\nand Village, the Bath Nature Preserve and Cuyahoga Valley National Park, it's\nbest accessed by taking Interstate 77 to Ghent Road (exit 138), turning north\nonto Ghent Road, which ends at Cleveland-Massillon Road.\n\nAmish Country Byway: 160-mile route featuring Holmes and Knox counties,\nrolling hills, sprawling vistas, historic sites, scenic rivers, the state's\nlongest covered bridge and restaurants specializing in Amish country cooking.\n\nJohnny Appleseed Historic Byway: Stretching more than 30 miles along Route 39\nbetween Mansfield and Loudonville and Route 603 between the village of Mifflin\nand Malabar Farm.\n\nAttractions include historic sites linked to John \"Appleseed\" Chapman.\n\nOhio & Erie Canalway: Tracing the story of the Ohio & Erie Canal and following\na general path from Dover to Cleveland.\n\nAbout 20 miles travels directly through Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Sights\ninclude farm fields, nature preserves, river corridors, bridges, smokestacks\nand canal remnants.\n\nHistoric National Road: Dating to the early 19th century, the Ohio portion\ncovers 225 miles, extending from the West Virginia state line at the Ohio\nRiver to the Indiana state line.\n\nMost of the alignment was incorporated into U.S. 40 when the national route\nsystem went into effect in the 1920s.\n\nHocking Hills: A 26-mile byway following state Route 374 through the natural\nbeauty of Hocking Hills and around Hocking State Forest.\n\nFor more information on the routes, visit:\n\nhttps://\u200bohio.gov/\u200bwps/\u200bportal/\u200bgov/\u200bsite/\u200btourism/\u200bresources/\u200bscenic-byways\n\nScenery and history\n\nCassler said logging miles on the Lincoln Highway is especially rewarding\nduring a time of uncertainty.\n\n\"I think it's more enjoyable now just because it's one of the few things you\ncan do to get out and see things without having to go into places that are\nclosed and restricted,\" he said. \"The scenery is always going to be there, and\nthe murals, the roads and things, they can't take those away.\"\n\nBeyond the fabled Lincoln Highway, Cassler said other gems abound throughout\nOhio.\n\n\"I think no matter where you are in the state, there's one of those fairly\nclose to you and they all offer scenery and history and interesting things to\ndo no matter what time of year or where you go.\"\n\nCREDIT: ED BALINT",

It&#8217;s expected to continue unless there&#8217;s a setback or backtracking on health-related restrictions. </p><p>After traffic numbers &#8220;bottomed out&#8221; in mid-April, &#8220;we&#8217;re starting to see a very slow but steady rebound,&#8221; said Bruning, the agency&#8217;s press secretary. </p><p>By the numbers </p><p>Statewide traffic data reflects the tightening and easing of the stay-at-home order issued near the end of March by Gov. <person>Mike DeWine</person>. </p><p>From <chron>March 15 to 21</chron>, statewide traffic decreased 30 percent compared to a year earlier, with <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Northeast Ohio</location> registering a 31 percent dip. </p><p>A plunge was recorded from <chron>March 22 to 28</chron>, with traffic down 46 percent, both across <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> and in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.canton\">Canton</location>-<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.akron\">Akron</location> region. </p><p>Traffic patterns held steady here and elsewhere on average until peaking at a roughly 49 percent weekly decrease from <chron>April 5 to 11</chron>, according to ODOT. </p><p>The numbers show a cause and effect: As salons, restaurants, offices, retail stores and other businesses continue to open, Ohioans are getting behind the wheel more frequently. </p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re slowly ticking back to normal levels where we would expect to be,&#8221; Bruning said. </p><p>&#8220;How will it look three months from now or six months from now until a year from now, it&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s guess,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This is certainly an unprecedented time.&#8221; </p><p>Scenic drives </p><p>Practical transportation, however, isn&#8217;t the only function of Ohio&#8217;s roads. There&#8217;s a rich network of historic routes and eye-pleasing byways, Bruning noted. </p><p>&#8220;I have a family of five,&#8221; he said. &#8220;... It is not uncommon for us to jump in the car and enjoy some of the scenery.&#8221; </p><p>Advising that residents should follow the pandemic-related directives of DeWine and state health officials, Bruning said, that &#8220;as long as you&#8217;re being safe, (road trips are) a great way to see and learn something about the state.&#8221; </p><p>Here&#8217;s a a handful of Ohio&#8217;s most scenic routes: </p><p><location>Lincoln Highway</location>: Representing the first roadway system in support of cars, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.wv.lincln\">Lincoln</location> was conceived in 1913 as the first highway from the <org>Atlantic</org> to the Pacific. </p><p><location>The Lincoln Highway Historic Byway</location> (240 miles in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location>) follows the final alignment adopted in 1928, linking the cities of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.canton\">Canton</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.maslon\">Massillon</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.wooter\">Wooster</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.maneld\">Mansfield</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.bucrus\">Bucyrus</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.uppsky\">Upper Sandusky</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.delhos\">Delphos</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.vanert\">Van Wert</location>. </p><p>Heritage Corridors of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.bath\">Bath</location>: Connecting 19th century hamlets with the <org>Hale Farm</org> and Village, the <location>Bath Nature Preserve</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.cuyprk\">Cuyahoga Valley National Park</location>, it&#8217;s best accessed by taking <location>Interstate 77</location> to <location>Ghent Road</location> (exit 138), turning north onto <location>Ghent Road</location>, which ends at <location>Cleveland-Massillon Road</location>. </p><p><location>Amish Country Byway</location>: 160-mile route featuring <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.holmes\">Holmes</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.knox\">Knox</location> counties, rolling hills, sprawling vistas, historic sites, scenic rivers, the state&#8217;s longest covered bridge and restaurants specializing in Amish country cooking. </p><p><location>Johnny Appleseed Historic Byway</location>: Stretching more than 30 miles along <location>Route 39</location> between <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.maneld\">Mansfield</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.loulle\">Loudonville</location> and <location>Route 603</location> between the village of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.miflin\">Mifflin</location> and <org>Malabar Farm</org>. </p><p>Attractions include historic sites linked to John &#8220;Appleseed&#8221; Chapman. </p><p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> &amp; Erie Canalway: Tracing the story of the <location>Ohio &amp; Erie Canal</location> and following a general path from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.dover\">Dover</location> to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.clevld\">Cleveland</location>. </p><p>About 20 miles travels directly through <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.oh.cuyprk\">Cuyahoga Valley National Park</location>. Sights include farm fields, nature preserves, river corridors, bridges, smokestacks and canal remnants. </p><p><location>Historic National Road</location>: Dating to the early 19th century, the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location> portion covers 225 miles, extending from the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wv\">West Virginia</location> state line at the <location>Ohio River</location> to the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.in\">Indiana</location> state line. </p><p>Most of the alignment was incorporated into <location>U.S. 40</location> when the national route system went into effect in the 1920s. </p><p><location>Hocking Hills</location>: A 26-mile byway following <location>state Route 374</location> through the natural beauty of <location>Hocking Hills</location> and around <location>Hocking State Forest</location>. </p><p>For more information on the routes, visit: </p><p>https://&#8203;ohio.gov/&#8203;wps/&#8203;portal/&#8203;gov/&#8203;site/&#8203;tourism/&#8203;resources/&#8203;scenic-byways </p><p>Scenery and history </p><p>Cassler said logging miles on the <location>Lincoln Highway</location> is especially rewarding during a time of uncertainty. </p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s more enjoyable now just because it&#8217;s one of the few things you can do to get out and see things without having to go into places that are closed and restricted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The scenery is always going to be there, and the murals, the roads and things, they can&#8217;t take those away.&#8221; </p><p>Beyond the fabled <location>Lincoln Highway</location>, Cassler said other gems abound throughout <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.oh\">Ohio</location>. </p><p>&#8220;I think no matter where you are in the state, there&#8217;s one of those fairly close to you and they all offer scenery and history and interesting things to do no matter what time of year or where you go.&#8221; </p><p>CREDIT: <person>ED BALINT</person></p>",
