SUMMARY\n\nOn May 14, 2020, Otter Tail Power Company (OTP or the Company) filed a\npetition (Petition)\n\nrequesting that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (Commission)\napprove:\n\n* its proposed refund of its 2020 year-to-date (January-March 2020) positive fuel cost\n\n(FCA) tracker balance of about $3.7 million to its Minnesota ratepayers; and\n\n* its proposed corresponding $0.0057/kWh reduction of the Commission-approved FCA\n\ncharges during the July-September 2020 period.\n\nII. BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nOn May 1, 2019, OTP filed its 2020 monthly forecasted energy adjustment rates\nbased on a 2020\n\nforecast of 5,032,227 Megawatt-hours (MWhs) in sales resulting in total 2020\nsystem fuel costs of\n\n$129,715,063, for an average fuel cost of $25.777/MWh.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, the Minnesota Department of Commerce \\- Division of Energy\nResources (the\n\nDepartment) filed comments (Department's Comments) recommending adjustments to\nthe net system\n\nFCA cost and requesting more information from OTP. In particular, the\nDepartment raised the\n\nfollowing two concerns:\n\n* OTP's 2020 system fuel costs included $293,682 in wholesale market charges that were\n\nalso recoverable under base rates and/or another rider;1 and\n\n* the forecasted decrease in the MWh of Production Plant in 2020 appears to be\n\ninconsistent with the relatively higher 2020 $/MWh market prices incorporated\nin OTP's\n\nStrategist run. This information suggested that the MWh amount of outages\nembedded\n\nin OTP's Strategist run was over-estimated.2\n\nOn July 31, 2019, OTP filed reply comments with revisions recommended by the\nDepartment, and\n\nadditional information. The Company acknowledged the double recovery issue\nraised by the\n\nDepartment and proposed a revised 2020 system fuel costs of $129,421,381, for\nan average fuel cost\n\nof $25.719/MWh.\n\n1 Department's Comments at page 18.\n\n2 Department's Comments at page 15.\n\nDocket No. E017/AA-19-297\n\nAnalyst assigned: Samir Ouanes\n\nPage 3\n\nOn August 30, 2019, the Department filed a response to OTP's reply comments,\nand recommended a\n\ndifferent system FCA cost than the Company, $124,996,398 or a reduction of\nabout $4.4 million, to\n\nalleviate the cost impact on OTP's ratepayers of the substantial and\nunsupported MWh increase in\n\nunplanned outages incorporated in OTP's revised 2020 system fuel cost of\n$129,421,381.\n\nOrdering Point 1 of the December 18, 2019 Order in Docket No. E017/AA-19-297\n(December 2019\n\nOrder) approved OTP's revised forecasted 2020 system FCA costs of $129,421,381\nand resulting\n\nmonthly FCA rates.3\n\nOn May 14, 2020, the Company filed a petition (Petition) requesting that the\nCommission approve its\n\nproposed reduction of the fuel cost charges for the July-September 2020 period\nin Docket No.\n\nE017/AA-19-297, as a result of OTP's actual costs for January-March 2020 being\n$8,477,547 lower than\n\nits Commission-approved January-March 2020 system fuel cost forecast in Docket\nNo. E017/AA-19-\n\n297.4\n\nOn May 22, 2020, the Commission approved OTP's January 30, 2020 compliance\nreport in Docket No.\n\nE017/M-03-30 and the annual true-up credit of 0.5 mills (0.05 cents) per kWh\nto be refunded over the\n\n12-month period beginning March 1, 2020.\n\nOn May 27, 2020, the Commission issued a Notice of Shortened Comment Period\n(Notice) with the\n\nfollowing topics open for comment:\n\n1\\. Is the request consistent with the Commission's June 12, 2019 Order\n\nApproving Additional Details Of New Fuel Clause Adjustment Process\n\n(June 12, 2019 Order)?\n\n2\\. Should the Commission approve Otter Tail's request to reduce, for the\n\nmonths of July through September 2020, its Energy Adjustment Rider\n\n(EAR or FCA) rates by $0.0057/kWh?\n\n3\\. Does Commission approval also require a rule variance or a reopening of\n\nthe June 12, 2019 Order?\n\n4\\. Is the handling of the proposed reduction reasonable?\n\n5\\. Can Otter Tail implement the proposed changes as requested without\n\nprior Commission approval?\n\n6\\. Are there other issues or concerns related to this matter?\n\nThe Department addresses the Notice's topics 1, 3 and 5 (legal issues) in\nSection III, topics 2 and 4 in\n\nSection IV and topic 6 in Section V.\n\n3 OTP's Commission-approved 2020 forecasted FCA costs and corresponding\nmonthly FCA rates are identified in Revised\n\nAttachment 2 (line 10) and Revised Attachment 1 (lines 3-12) of OTP's July 31,\n2019 reply comments in Docket No.\n\nE017/AA-19-297.\n\n4 Source: Department's calculation based on Table 1 of the Petition.\n\nDocket No. E017/AA-19-297\n\nAnalyst assigned: Samir Ouanes\n\nPage 4\n\nIII. DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS-LEGAL ISSUES\n\nOrdering Point 3 of the June 12, 2019 Order in Docket No. E999/CI-03-802\nstated:\n\nThe Commission adopts a threshold of plus or minus 5 percent of all FCA\n\ncosts and revenues to determine whether an event qualifies as a significant\n\nunforeseen impact that may justify an adjustment to the approved fuel\n\nrates. The Electric Utilities are permitted to implement revised rates\n\nfollowing a 30-day notice period, subject to a full refund, if no party\nobjects\n\nto the revised rates.\n\nAttachment 1 of the Petition shows that OTP's actual costs for the first three\nmonths of 2020 met the\n\nCommission's threshold of plus or minus 5 percent of all FCA costs and\nrevenues to determine whether\n\nan event qualifies as a significant unforeseen impact that may justify an\nadjustment to the approved\n\nfuel rates. The Company's ratio of its over-recovery by its energy costs for\nthe first three months of\n\n2020 is above 25 percent.\n\nAccording to OTP, \"the combination of economic impacts caused by COVID-19,\nalong with low\n\nnatural gas prices and LMPs, qualify as events with 'significant unforeseen\nimpacts'.\"5 While the\n\nCompany did not address explicitly whether the costs were unforeseeable and\noutside of the utility's\n\ncontrol, are expected to continue for the remainder of the year, and are\nreasonable to pass on to\n\nratepayers, per the standard developed by the parties as described on page 6\nof the June 12, 2019\n\nOrder, it appears that each component is met, as discussed below.6\n\nSpecifically, in light of the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\non utility operations,\n\neconomic conditions, and consumers' personal finances, the Department supports\nOTP's proposal to\n\nreduce its monthly fuel cost charges for all customers as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, the Department notes that low natural gas prices and LMPs may\nalso qualify as\n\n\"unforeseeable and outside of the utility's control.\" Moreover, as discussed\nfurther under Section V\n\nbelow, the Department expects OTP's actual costs to continue to be below the\nCommission-approved\n\nforecasted rates7 due in part to lower MWh amount of unplanned outages than\nembedded in rates.\n\nThe Company is simply proposing to provide its first quarter of 2020 over-\nrecovery of about $3.7\n\nmillion as a refund to customers sooner (when customers need it most) rather\nthan waiting for the\n\nannual 2021 true-up that will be processed under the new FCA reform mechanism.",

SUMMARY</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>May 14, 2020</chron>, <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0034528689\">Otter Tail Power Company</org> (OTP or the Company)\nfiled a petition (Petition)</p>\n\n<p>requesting that the <org>Minnesota Public Utilities Commission</org>\n(Commission) approve:</p>\n\n<p>* its proposed refund of its 2020 year-to-date (January-<chron>March 2020</chron>)\npositive fuel cost</p>\n\n<p>(FCA) tracker balance of about <money>$3.7 million</money> to its <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</location>\nratepayers; and</p>\n\n<p>* its proposed corresponding <money>$0.0057</money>/kWh reduction of the\nCommission-approved <org>FCA</org></p>\n\n<p>charges during the July-<chron>September 2020</chron> period.</p>\n\n<p>II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>May 1, 2019</chron>, OTP filed its 2020 monthly forecasted energy\nadjustment rates based on a 2020</p>\n\n<p>forecast of 5,032,227 Megawatt-hours (MWhs) in sales resulting in\ntotal 2020 system fuel costs of</p>\n\n<p><money>$129,715,063</money>, for an average fuel cost of <money>$25.777</money>/MWh.</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>July 1, 2019</chron>, the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3587488478\">Minnesota Department of Commerce</org> - <org>Division of\nEnergy Resources</org> (the</p>\n\n<p>Department) filed comments (Department's Comments)\nrecommending adjustments to the net system</p>\n\n<p><org>FCA</org> cost and requesting more information from OTP. In particular,\nthe Department raised the</p>\n\n<p>following two concerns:</p>\n\n<p>* OTP's 2020 system fuel costs included <money>$293,682</money> in wholesale\nmarket charges that were</p>\n\n<p>also recoverable under base rates and/or another rider;1 and</p>\n\n<p>* the forecasted decrease in the MWh of Production Plant in 2020\nappears to be</p>\n\n<p>inconsistent with the relatively higher 2020 $/MWh market prices\nincorporated in OTP's</p>\n\n<p>Strategist run. This information suggested that the MWh amount of\noutages embedded</p>\n\n<p>in OTP's Strategist run was over-estimated.2</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>July 31, 2019</chron>, OTP filed reply comments with revisions\nrecommended by the Department, and</p>\n\n<p>additional information. The Company acknowledged the double\nrecovery issue raised by the</p>\n\n<p>Department and proposed a revised 2020 system fuel costs of\n<money>$129,421,381</money>, for an average fuel cost</p>\n\n<p>of <money>$25.719</money>/MWh.</p>\n\n<p>1 Department's Comments at page 18.</p>\n\n<p>2 Department's Comments at page 15.</p>\n\n<p>Docket No. E017/AA-19-297</p>\n\n<p>Analyst assigned: <person>Samir Ouanes</person></p>\n\n<p>Page 3</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>August 30, 2019</chron>, the Department filed a response to OTP's\nreply comments, and recommended a</p>\n\n<p>different system <org>FCA</org> cost than the Company, <money>$124,996,398</money> or a\nreduction of about <money>$4.4 million</money>, to</p>\n\n<p>alleviate the cost impact on OTP's ratepayers of the\nsubstantial and unsupported MWh increase in</p>\n\n<p>unplanned outages incorporated in OTP's revised 2020 system\nfuel cost of <money>$129,421,381</money>.</p>\n\n<p>Ordering Point 1 of the <chron>December 18, 2019</chron> Order in Docket No.\nE017/AA-19-297 (<chron>December 2019</chron></p>\n\n<p>Order) approved OTP's revised forecasted 2020 system <org>FCA</org> costs\nof <money>$129,421,381</money> and resulting</p>\n\n<p>monthly <org>FCA</org> rates.3</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>May 14, 2020</chron>, the Company filed a petition (Petition) requesting\nthat the Commission approve its</p>\n\n<p>proposed reduction of the fuel cost charges for the July-<chron>September\n2020</chron> period in Docket No.</p>\n\n<p>E017/AA-19-297, as a result of OTP's actual costs for\nJanuary-<chron>March 2020</chron> being <money>$8,477,547</money> lower than</p>\n\n<p>its Commission-approved January-<chron>March 2020</chron> system fuel cost\nforecast in Docket No. E017/AA-19-</p>\n\n<p>297.4</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>May 22, 2020</chron>, the Commission approved OTP's <chron>January 30,\n2020</chron> compliance report in Docket No.</p>\n\n<p>E017/M-03-30 and the annual true-up credit of 0.5 mills (<money>0.05\ncents</money>) per kWh to be refunded over the</p>\n\n<p>12-month period beginning <chron>March 1, 2020</chron>.</p>\n\n<p>On <chron>May 27, 2020</chron>, the Commission issued a Notice of Shortened\nComment Period (Notice) with the</p>\n\n<p>following topics open for comment:</p>\n\n<p>1. Is the request consistent with the Commission's <chron>June 12,\n2019</chron> Order</p>\n\n<p>Approving Additional Details Of New Fuel Clause Adjustment Process</p>\n\n<p>(<chron>June 12, 2019</chron> Order)?</p>\n\n<p>2. Should the Commission approve Otter Tail's request to\nreduce, for the</p>\n\n<p>months of July through <chron>September 2020</chron>, its Energy Adjustment Rider</p>\n\n<p>(EAR or <org>FCA</org>) rates by <money>$0.0057</money>/kWh?</p>\n\n<p>3. <org>Does Commission</org> approval also require a rule variance or a\nreopening of</p>\n\n<p>the <chron>June 12, 2019</chron> Order?</p>\n\n<p>4. Is the handling of the proposed reduction reasonable?</p>\n\n<p>5. Can Otter Tail implement the proposed changes as requested\nwithout</p>\n\n<p>prior Commission approval?</p>\n\n<p>6.

DEPARTMENT ANALYSIS-LEGAL ISSUES</p>\n\n<p>Ordering Point 3 of the <chron>June 12, 2019</chron> Order in Docket No.\nE999/CI-03-802 stated:</p>\n\n<p>The Commission adopts a threshold of plus or minus 5 percent of all\n<org>FCA</org></p>\n\n<p>costs and revenues to determine whether an event qualifies as a\nsignificant</p>\n\n<p>unforeseen impact that may justify an adjustment to the approved\nfuel</p>\n\n<p>rates. <org>The Electric Utilities</org> are permitted to implement revised\nrates</p>\n\n<p>following a 30-day notice period, subject to a full refund, if no\nparty objects</p>\n\n<p>to the revised rates.</p>\n\n<p>Attachment 1 of the Petition shows that OTP's actual costs for\nthe first three months of 2020 met the</p>\n\n<p>Commission's threshold of plus or minus 5 percent of all <org>FCA</org>\ncosts and revenues to determine whether</p>\n\n<p>an event qualifies as a significant unforeseen impact that may\njustify an adjustment to the approved</p>\n\n<p>fuel rates. The Company's ratio of its over-recovery by its\nenergy costs for the first three months of</p>\n\n<p>2020 is above 25 percent.</p>\n\n<p>According to OTP, \"the combination of economic impacts caused\nby COVID-19, along with low</p>\n\n<p>natural gas prices and LMPs, qualify as events with\n'significant unforeseen impacts'.\"5 While the</p>\n\n<p>Company did not address explicitly whether the costs were\nunforeseeable and outside of the utility's</p>\n\n<p>control, are expected to continue for the remainder of the year,\nand are reasonable to pass on to</p>\n\n<p>ratepayers, per the standard developed by the parties as described\non page 6 of the <chron>June 12, 2019</chron></p>\n\n<p>Order, it appears that each component is met, as discussed below.6</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, in light of the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19\npandemic on utility operations,</p>\n\n<p>economic conditions, and consumers' personal finances, the\nDepartment supports OTP's proposal to</p>\n\n<p>reduce its monthly fuel cost charges for all customers as soon as\npossible.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the Department notes that low natural gas prices and\nLMPs may also qualify as</p>\n\n<p>\"unforeseeable and outside of the utility's\ncontrol.\" Moreover, as discussed further under Section V</p>\n\n<p>below, the Department expects OTP's actual costs to continue\nto be below the Commission-approved</p>\n\n<p>forecasted rates7 due in part to lower MWh amount of unplanned\noutages than embedded in rates.</p>\n\n<p>The Company is simply proposing to provide its first quarter of\n2020 over-recovery of about <money>$3.7</money></p>\n\n<p>million as a refund to customers sooner (when customers need it\nmost) rather than waiting for the</p>\n\n<p>annual 2021 true-up that will be processed under the new <org>FCA</org> reform\nmechanism.</p>",
