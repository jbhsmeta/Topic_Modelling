    "text": "When I turned on my TV last weekend, I was reminded of the Civil Rights\nMovement more than 50 years ago. I participated when I was in college in\nMarshall Texas. At that time, the students from both Bishop College (where I\nwas a student) and our cross town rivals Wiley College joined the Sit-In\nMovement.\n\nWe were demonstrating (peacefully) on behalf of the many Black students from\nthroughout the South who were being arrested for sitting at lunch counters. It\nwas the modern Civil Rights Movement. The leader of that movement nationally\nbecame Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. King became the leader of the movement\nafter he went to jail for coming to the aid of Rosa Parks. Parks was arrested\nbecause she would not give up her seat on the city bus to a White passenger.\n\nThe movement of Non Violent Protest was put in motion; and was in place druing\nthe Civil Rights Movement. That was the time that police were given the right\nto kill Black people anytime they saw fit. The regretable thing about this is,\nlike today, none of the police or other White men were ever convicted of\nmurder. And most of them were never brought up on charges.\n\nAfter the Civil Rights Bill was passed, unfair treatment was reduced, but\nnever outlawed. As a result, Black Men and other minorities are still at risk\nof being killed at will by people who believe that their rights comes before\nothers.\n\nLocal demonstrators went to the Police Station to remind the city leaders that\nwe still have cases pending in this city on Police Officers who have not been\ncharged for killing unarmed citizens. It is time to demand fair treatment by\npeople who are paid to protect all of us.",

    "html": "<p>When I turned on my TV last weekend, I was reminded of the <org>Civil Rights Movement</org> more than 50 years ago. I participated when I was in college in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.tx.marall\">Marshall Texas</location>. At that time, the students from both <org>Bishop College</org> (where I was a student) and our cross town rivals <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1645078813\">Wiley College</org> joined the <org>Sit-In Movement</org>.</p>\n<p>We were demonstrating (peacefully) on behalf of the many Black students from throughout the South who were being arrested for sitting at lunch counters. It was the modern <org>Civil Rights Movement</org>. The leader of that movement nationally became Dr. <person>Martin Luther King</person>, Jr.. King became the leader of the movement after he went to jail for coming to the aid of <person>Rosa Parks</person>. Parks was arrested because she would not give up her seat on the city bus to a White passenger.</p>\n\n<p>The movement of Non Violent Protest was put in motion; and was in place druing the <org>Civil Rights Movement</org>. That was the time that police were given the right to kill Black people anytime they saw fit. The regretable thing about this is, like today, none of the police or other White men were ever convicted of murder. And most of them were never brought up on charges.</p>\n\n<p>After the Civil Rights Bill was passed, unfair treatment was reduced, but never outlawed. As a result, Black Men and other minorities are still at risk of being killed at will by people who believe that their rights comes before others.</p>\n\n<p>Local demonstrators went to the <location>Police Station</location> to remind the city leaders that we still have cases pending in this city on Police Officers who have not been charged for killing unarmed citizens. It is time to demand fair treatment by people who are paid to protect all of us.</p>",
