They really need people's business right now.\"\n\nBinzer took the idea to Mayor Marty Handlon and the Council, all of whom were\nsupportive.\n\nCouncil members chose two or more businesses to highlight, based on local\nownership status and those officials felt were suffering most during the\npandemic.\n\nFollowing the Council's videos, Alabaster residents were challenged to\ncontinue the campaign by posting about their favorite businesses with the\nhashtag #ShopAlabasterFirst.\n\nThis also gives residents the opportunity to promote any businesses the\nCouncil members did not get around to.\n\n\"We'd love to see that,\" Binzer said. \"We'd love to see more of these\nbusinesses be highlighted.\"\n\nSophie Martin highlighted Joe's Italian and Blair Pharmacy, Rick Ellis\nhighlighted Siluria Brewing and Chubbfathers, Stacy Rakestraw highlighted The\nSassy Shopper and Birds & Burgers, Greg Farrell highlighted Sanctuary\nChristian Books and Gifts and Brooklere Pharmacy, Russell Bedsole highlighted\nErnest McCarty Ford and Deep South Cake Company, Scott Brakefield highlighted\nFrou Frou Boutique, The Pit Stop Barbershop and Champy's, and Kerri Pate\nhighlighted LJ's Retail Therapy and Corbin Farms Winery.\n\n\"For the last three weeks, we've posted these videos to encourage you to shop\nour locally owned Alabaster businesses first,\" Martin said in her video. \"Now\nwe want to hear from you, Alabaster.\"\n\nVideo Visions produced and hosted the videos, while Binzer and Martin, who has\nbroadcast experience, prepared the scripts.\n\nShare this:\n\n* Twitter\n\n* Facebook",

They really need people's business right now.\"</p>\n\n<p>Binzer took the idea to Mayor <person>Marty Handlon</person> and the Council, all of whom were supportive.</p>\n\n<p>Council members chose two or more businesses to highlight, based on local ownership status and those officials felt were suffering most during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Council's videos, Alabaster residents were challenged to continue the campaign by posting about their favorite businesses with the hashtag #ShopAlabasterFirst.</p>\n\n<p>This also gives residents the opportunity to promote any businesses the Council members did not get around to.</p>\n\n<p>\"We'd love to see that,\" Binzer said. \"We'd love to see more of these businesses be highlighted.\"</p>\n\n<p><person>Sophie Martin</person> highlighted Joe's Italian and <org>Blair Pharmacy</org>, <person>Rick Ellis</person> highlighted Siluria Brewing and Chubbfathers, <person>Stacy Rakestraw</person> highlighted The Sassy Shopper and Birds &amp; Burgers, <person>Greg Farrell</person> highlighted <org>Sanctuary Christian Books</org> and Gifts and <org>Brooklere Pharmacy</org>, <person>Russell Bedsole</person> highlighted <person>Ernest McCarty Ford</person> and <org>Deep South Cake Company</org>, <person>Scott Brakefield</person> highlighted <org>Frou Frou Boutique</org>, The Pit Stop Barbershop and Champy's, and <person>Kerri Pate</person> highlighted LJ's Retail Therapy and <org>Corbin Farms Winery</org>.</p>\n\n<p>\"For the last three weeks, we've posted these videos to encourage you to shop our locally owned Alabaster businesses first,\" Martin said in her video. \"Now we want to hear from you, Alabaster.\"</p>\n\n<p>Video Visions produced and hosted the videos, while Binzer and Martin, who has broadcast experience, prepared the scripts.</p>\n\n<p>Share this:</p>\n\n<p>*  Twitter</p>\n\n<p>*  Facebook</p>",
