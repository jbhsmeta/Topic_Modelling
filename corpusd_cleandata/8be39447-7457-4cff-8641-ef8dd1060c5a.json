    "text": "Politicians' selective outrage\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Memorial Day weekend, State Sen. Declan O'Scanlon\nand Monmouth County Freeholder Gerry Scharfenberger, released statements and\nshowed up at \"rallies\" to reopen the state and restart the economy that had\nbeen put under lockdown by Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nIn fact, Mr. O'Scanlon even encouraged people to break the law. Murphy's\nchoice to grind New Jersey to a halt in mid-March was to ensure the flattening\nof the COVID-19 curve and to not only protect the most vulnerable of our\nresidents, but to also keep our health care system from being overwhelmed by a\ndeluge of cases.\n\nOver the past week, as tensions mount over the murder of George Floyd at the\nhands of a Minneapolis police officer and 25 major metropolitan areas across\nthe nation hold public protests demanding action, neither of these elected\nofficials has released as intense a statement as they did when they stood with\nsmall business owners.\n\nWhere is the outrage about the president idly throwing around militaristic\nrhetoric and threats toward American citizens who are exercising their First\nAmendment rights, largely peacefully and within the rules of the system?\n\nWhere is that bold, American spirit these men touted to protect the freedoms\nof business owners? A questioning of the most powerful Republican by other,\nelected Republicans would go a long way - much longer than my personal,\nprogressive criticism would ever get.\n\nSome cops are defusing the anger\n\nHow nice it is to see police officers standing, marching and kneeling in\nsolidarity with those protesting the killing of George Floyd.\n\nWhere this is being done, we witness stellar examples of chiefs, departments\nand individual officers who recognize that they are vital members of the\ncommunity and that in breaking down the barriers between themselves and the\npeople they serve they defuse anger, strengthen their mission and help heal\nthe divisions that have been allowed to separate us.\n\nWho'd have ever thought that just four years after Colin Kaepernick was\nunjustly vilified for his peaceful, dignified protest we'd see police officers\ntaking a knee?\n\nWhat a tonic for these troubled times!",

Murphy's choice to grind <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.nj\">New Jersey</location> to a halt in mid-March was to ensure the flattening of the COVID-19 curve and to not only protect the most vulnerable of our residents, but to also keep our health care system from being overwhelmed by a deluge of cases.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past week, as tensions mount over the murder of <person>George Floyd</person> at the hands of a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.mn.minnea\">Minneapolis</location> police officer and 25 major metropolitan areas across the nation hold public protests demanding action, neither of these elected officials has released as intense a statement as they did when they stood with small business owners.</p>\n\n<p>Where is the outrage about the president idly throwing around militaristic rhetoric and threats toward American citizens who are exercising their First Amendment rights, largely peacefully and within the rules of the system?</p>\n\n<p>Where is that bold, American spirit these men touted to protect the freedoms of business owners? A questioning of the most powerful Republican by other, elected <org>Republicans</org> would go a long way - much longer than my personal, progressive criticism would ever get.</p>\n\n<p>Some cops are defusing the anger</p>\n\n<p>How nice it is to see police officers standing, marching and kneeling in solidarity with those protesting the killing of <person>George Floyd</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Where this is being done, we witness stellar examples of chiefs, departments and individual officers who recognize that they are vital members of the community and that in breaking down the barriers between themselves and the people they serve they defuse anger, strengthen their mission and help heal the divisions that have been allowed to separate us.</p>\n\n<p>Who'd have ever thought that just four years after <person>Colin Kaepernick</person> was unjustly vilified for his peaceful, dignified protest we'd see police officers taking a knee?</p>\n\n<p>What a tonic for these troubled times!</p>",
