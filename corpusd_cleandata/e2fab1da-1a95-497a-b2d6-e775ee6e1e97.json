    "text": "Earlier in this pandemic, the shortage of tests for coronavirus was a major\nproblem in fighting the spread of COVID-19. The shortage was such that many\nhospitals and clinics would only test someone who had traveled to a country\nwith an outbreak, had a known exposure to a positive case or showed symptoms\nof the disease.\n\nBut access to tests has improved significantly, and in some places, people can\nnow get tested without having to demonstrate any symptoms at all. So if you\ncan get tested, should you?\n\nThe answer is a little complicated. One point to clarify: We're talking here\nabout the diagnostic or PCR test, used to diagnose people who are currently\nsick with COVID-19. We're not talking about antibody or antigen tests, which\nare different.\n\nThe short answer to the question is: Sure, get tested if you want. But the\ntests are not perfect, and the result will only tell you so much.\n\nLet's say you test positive. Your doctor will likely instruct you to self-\nisolate at home. Since you're not showing symptoms, it could mean that you\nhappened to be tested at just the right time and are infected with the virus\nbut are. asymptomatic. You could also be presymptomatic and develop symptoms\nin the coming days. The CDC says that if you continue to have no symptoms, you\ncan end self-isolation 10 days after your test.\n\nA positive result could also mean you were sick weeks earlier, fully recovered\nand are not infectious. The PCR test has sometimes shown positive results\nweeks after someone recovers, says Dr. Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard\nMedical School: \"The test could be detecting RNA [of the virus] even in people\nwho are recovered - but that doesn't mean that they're infectious.\"\n\nNow let's say you test negative. That news would probably come as a relief.\nPerhaps you're hoping a negative result would free you to do certain\nactivities without fear \u0096 say, return to work or visit an older family member\nyou haven't seen in months.\n\nBut Dr. Emily Landon, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases\nspecialist at University of Chicago Medicine, warns that a negative test\nshouldn't be seen as your ticket to stop being cautious.\n\n\"We don't know how good these tests are in individuals who don't have\nsymptoms,\" she says. \"We know they're pretty good at picking up COVID when\nit's present in people who have symptoms. But we have no idea what a negative\ntest means in an individual that doesn't have symptoms.\"\n\n\"We are certain that there are people who test negative even though they are\ndefinitely contagious,\" she says. \"A positive test can make us relatively\ncertain that you are shedding COVID. But a negative test does not mean the\nopposite.\" It could be that you were tested too early in the disease process\nor that the swab didn't pick up your infection.\n\nLandon says it takes at least three to five days after exposure to test\npositive. What's more, some people test positive, then negative, then positive\nagain. Hospitals often test people with symptoms twice to try to be more\ncertain about the finding.\n\nThe imperfections in test results have made it difficult to know how often\nhealth-care workers need to be tested, she says, because a negative test\ndoesn't mean you don't have the virus or \"that you can just stop wearing your\nmask and not worry about it anymore.\"\n\nIn other words, she says, if you're getting tested to get peace of mind \u0096 a\nnegative test shouldn't give you much peace of mind.\n\nNonetheless, Robert Hecht, professor of clinical epidemiology at Yale\nUniversity, offers \"an encouraging thumbs-up\" to anyone who decides to get\ntested for the virus just because.\n\n\"This idea that you should be both concerned about your own status and\nrecognize that you can be infected without symptoms - and that states should\ntry to make more testing capacity available for people like that,\" he says. \"I\nthink those are all good things in general.\"\n\nFrom a public health perspective, Landon says there is some value in the odd\nasymptomatic person being tested and finding out whether they do indeed have\nCOVID-19. \"It gives you a better idea of how many people are sick. It helps us\nto understand the test dynamics better. And anytime somebody is positive, you\ncan remove them from the equation [of transmission],\" she says, by taking\nprecautions so they don't infect others.\n\nBut since the negative test doesn't tell you for sure that you don't have the\nvirus, it's not a 100% guarantee that it's safe to visit your 80-year-old\ngrandparent.\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR.

    "title": "Should I Get Tested For Coronavirus Just For The Heck Of It?",
    "html": "<p>Earlier in this pandemic, the shortage of tests for coronavirus was a major problem in fighting the spread of COVID-19. The shortage was such that many hospitals and clinics would only test someone who had traveled to a country with an outbreak, had a known exposure to a positive case or showed symptoms of the disease.</p>\n<p>But access to tests has improved significantly, and in some places, people can now get tested without having to demonstrate any symptoms at all. So if you can get tested, should you?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is a little complicated. One point to clarify: We're talking here about the diagnostic or PCR test, used to diagnose people who are currently sick with COVID-19. We're not talking about antibody or antigen tests, which are different.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer to the question is: Sure, get tested if you want. But the tests are not perfect, and the result will only tell you so much.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you test positive. Your doctor will likely instruct you to self-isolate at home. Since you're not showing symptoms, it could mean that you happened to be tested at just the right time and are infected with the virus but are. asymptomatic. You could also be presymptomatic and develop symptoms in the coming days. The <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">CDC</org> says that if you continue to have no symptoms, you can end self-isolation 10 days after your test.</p>\n\n<p>A positive result could also mean you were sick weeks earlier, fully recovered and are not infectious. The PCR test has sometimes shown positive results weeks after someone recovers, says Dr. Abraar Karan, a physician at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:3595432114\">Harvard Medical School</org>: \"The test could be detecting RNA [of the virus] even in people who are recovered - but that doesn't mean that they're infectious.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now let's say you test negative. That news would probably come as a relief. Perhaps you're hoping a negative result would free you to do certain activities without fear &#150; say, return to work or visit an older family member you haven't seen in months.</p>\n\n<p>But Dr. <person>Emily Landon</person>, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist at <org>University of Chicago Medicine</org>, warns that a negative test shouldn't be seen as your ticket to stop being cautious.</p>\n\n<p>\"We don't know how good these tests are in individuals who don't have symptoms,\" she says. \"We know they're pretty good at picking up COVID when it's present in people who have symptoms. But we have no idea what a negative test means in an individual that doesn't have symptoms.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We are certain that there are people who test negative even though they are definitely contagious,\" she says. \"A positive test can make us relatively certain that you are shedding COVID. But a negative test does not mean the opposite.\" It could be that you were tested too early in the disease process or that the swab didn't pick up your infection.</p>\n\n<p>Landon says it takes at least three to five days after exposure to test positive. What's more, some people test positive, then negative, then positive again. Hospitals often test people with symptoms twice to try to be more certain about the finding.</p>\n\n<p>The imperfections in test results have made it difficult to know how often health-care workers need to be tested, she says, because a negative test doesn't mean you don't have the virus or \"that you can just stop wearing your mask and not worry about it anymore.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, she says, if you're getting tested to get peace of mind &#150; a negative test shouldn't give you much peace of mind.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, <person>Robert Hecht</person>, professor of clinical epidemiology at <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0064157395\">Yale University</org>, offers \"an encouraging thumbs-up\" to anyone who decides to get tested for the virus just because.</p>\n\n<p>\"This idea that you should be both concerned about your own status and recognize that you can be infected without symptoms - and that states should try to make more testing capacity available for people like that,\" he says. \"I think those are all good things in general.\"</p>\n\n<p>From a public health perspective, Landon says there is some value in the odd asymptomatic person being tested and finding out whether they do indeed have COVID-19. \"It gives you a better idea of how many people are sick. It helps us to understand the test dynamics better. And anytime somebody is positive, you can remove them from the equation [of transmission],\" she says, by taking precautions so they don't infect others.</p>\n\n<p>But since the negative test doesn't tell you for sure that you don't have the virus, it's not a 100% guarantee that it's safe to visit your 80-year-old grandparent.</p>\n\n<p>Copyright 2020 NPR.
