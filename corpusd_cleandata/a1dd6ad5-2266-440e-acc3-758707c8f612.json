    "text": "By RANDY MINK\n\nSpecial to the Journal & Topics\n\nI didn't exactly have visions of sugar plums dancing in my head, but during\nlast December's Danube River cruise featuring the Christmas markets of Central\nEurope, I certainly got my fill of gingerbread, strudel and spiced wine. Like\na kid anticipating Christmas morning, I looked forward to every stop to see\nwhat Santa had in store ashore.\n\nOn port calls in Germany, Austria and Hungary, I and fellow passengers on the\nScenic Amber reveled in traipsing through the temporary shopping villages that\ntake over the historic hearts of cities like Nuremburg, Salzburg and Vienna\nevery November and December. It was magical soaking in the yuletide mirth\nwhile nibbling goodies, imbibing warm beverages and shopping for gifts from\nvendors in their snug little huts. Waiting for us after the tours was a sleek\nriver ship that spoiled us rotten.\n\nBesides merriment ashore, the conviviality onboard, in keeping with the\nseason, seemed to be turned up a notch. Our jolly English cruise director set\nthe tone, as did the rest of the staff, most of them from Eastern Europe.\n\nAt most destinations we had a choice of three or four tours, with one or more\nincluding a seasonal market. With Christmas Day gift giving just days away, we\nfelt a heightened sense of mission prowling the lanes of stalls filled with\nfoods and handicrafts distinctive to this part of the world.\n\nOur one-week \"Danube Christmas Markets\" adventure on the Scenic Amber, one of\n13 river ships operated in Europe by Scenic Luxury Cruises & Tours, started,\nappropriately, in the Bavarian city of Nuremburg (pop. 530,000), home to\nGermany's biggest and most famous Christmas market. We then sailed to\nRegensburg and Passau before calling at four Austrian cities - Linz, Melk,\nDurnstein and Vienna. The holiday fling ended in Budapest, Hungary, two days\nbefore Christmas.\n\nCome Advent season in Nuremburg's Old Town, row after row of huts trimmed in\ncandy cane-striped awnings crowd the cobbled plaza by the Church of Our Lady.\nMany Scenic Amber passengers took the city tour that included the\nChristkindlesmarkt, a Nuremburg tradition since 1628. Drifting among the 170\nstalls, they shopped for handmade ornaments, wooden toys, nutcrackers,\ncandles, soaps and other artisan wares. Among the must-try foods and drinks:\nwine mulled with spices like cinnamon and cloves (Gluhwein), finger-like\nNuremburg bratwursts, and all shapes and sizes of the highly spiced\ngingerbread (Lebkuchen) made with honey, oats and ground nuts (little flour,\nif any). One tour option featured a gingerbread-baking class.\n\nRegensburg, 53 miles downriver, boasts Germany's largest medieval district,\nthe perfect backdrop for Christmas shopping. Scenic-arranged walking tours in\nRegensburg's Old Town offered the option of holiday markets in the main square\nor at St. Emmeram Palace, the ancestral home of Regensburg's princely Thurn\nund Taxis family. Every year the family, the largest private landowners in\nGermany, hosts a first-rate market. My group had time to peruse the stalls\nbefore and after a tour of the palace, an important monastery in the Middle\nAges.\n\nAround the courtyard's Christmas tree and across the grounds, wood fires kept\nus warm as we stood at tables with hot drinks (though the outdoor temperature\nthat afternoon was a not-so-bad 48 degrees). Each tour member received a\nvoucher good for one cup at a Gluhwein stand. Throughout the cruise,\npassengers had fun collecting these souvenir cups inscribed with the year and\nname of the market (instead of returning them for the deposit). With my\nblueberry-flavored wine I had a piece of chocolate-covered gingerbread with\nalmonds. If only there had been room in my tummy for the crepes or waffles,\nthe hot chestnuts or candied mixed nuts, or the apple strudel in vanilla\nsauce.\n\nEvery merchant's stall at the Thurn und Taxis estate offered something\ndifferent, whether it was colorful knitwear, Russian stacking dolls or carved-\nwood Nativity sets and figurines. As the sun set, the marketplace turned into\na wonderland lit by candles, lanterns and torches. A brass band entertained\nfrom a courtyard balcony.\n\nFrom the German city of Passau, 85 miles southeast of Regensburg, cruise\npassengers boarded tour buses for Salzburg, Austria, or Cesky Krumlov, a\npicture-perfect Czech town with sloping medieval streets. I chose Salzburg,\nhaving gained an affection for the city while living there as a student long\nago.\n\nAfter all these years, Salzburg's Old Town, with fairy-tale castle perched\nhigh above, looks just the way I remember it. And the city still plays up its\nties to \"The Sound of Music,\" the 1965 movie classic starring Julie Andrews,\nas many scenes were filmed in Salzburg and environs, home base of the singing\nvon Trapp family.\n\nOur Old Town walking tour featured \"Sound of Music\" locations, beautiful\nchurches and the city's other big claim to fame - the birthplace of Wolfgang\nAmadeus Mozart. For old times' sake, I bought a bag and box of Mozartkugeln -\nballs of dark chocolate-coated candy layered with pistachio marzipan and dark\nand light praline cream. Each piece is wrapped in gold foil bearing the\ncomposer's portrait.\n\nYou'll find Mozartkugeln at the Salzburg Christmas Market, where, after lunch,\nwe had time to browse the huts clustered on squares fronting the Cathedral and\nResidenz, the 17th-century palace of Salzburg's prince-archbishops. Lunch was\nnot just anywhere - Scenic reserved for us one of the 11 vaulted dining rooms\nat the oldest restaurant in Europe, St. Peter Stiftkulinarium. Ensconced in\nthe cave-like cliff by the sumptuous Baroque St. Peter's Abbey, it has been\ndishing up food since 803.\n\nFrom Salzburg, buses took us to Linz, where our ship was waiting to welcome us\nback. Instead of having dinner onboard, I walked over to the Christmas market\nin the main square, 10 minutes away.\n\nThe Scenic Amber's lounge, decked out for the holidays during our December\nsailing, bubbled with Christmas cheer when we gathered for port talks,\nentertainment and games. It didn't hurt that alcoholic drinks were\ncomplimentary day and night. (A Scenic cruise is all-inclusive, meaning the\nfare covers beverages, meals, shore excursions, Wi-Fi, gratuities and airport\ntransfers.)\n\nLocal performers brought onboard included a Bavarian brass band and Austrian\nand Hungarian folk dancers. One night passengers split into teams for\nChristmas trivia.\n\nThe ship's dining room served specialties representative of the countries we\nvisited. Among choices on our dinner menu in Vienna, for example, were wiener\nschnitzel and apple strudel. A mini-smorgasbord in the lounge that night\npresented more Austrian favorites - pretzels and pretzel rolls, frankfurters\nwith mustard, goulash soup and Kaiserschmarren (shredded sweet pancakes) with\napplesauce.\n\nThe majority of passengers on our sailing were Americans. Other guests came\nfrom Australia, Canada and Japan.\n\nAfter Linz, our next stop was Melk, where we had a morning tour of Melk Abbey,\na majestic Baroque building overlooking the Danube. On the way to Durnstein, a\ncharming Wachau Valley village two hours from Melk, we had one of the few\ndaytime chances to go out on deck and watch the scenery pass by. It was cool\nand breezy, and for the first time on the trip I took out my hat and gloves.\nIn Durnstein, noted for its romantic castle ruins perched above town, we had\ntwo hours to shop and poke around the cobbled lanes.\n\nOur day in Vienna was split between morning excursions and afternoon free\ntime. I opted to visit Schonbrunn Palace, the 1,441-room summer home of the\nHapsburg rulers. After an hour touring the Royal Apartments, there was time\nfor shopping and noshing at the extensive Christmas market in the forecourt.\nSome of us went to the apple strudel-making demonstration (\"Strudelshow\") in\nthe palace's cafe building.\n\nIt started raining just after we left Schonbrunn, but rather than head back to\nthe ship, I toughed it out, umbrella in hand, and spent the next five hours\nexploring Vienna's history-rich Inner City. The weather dampened some plans\nbut not mine, as I was determined to see the monumental sights remembered from\nvisits long ago. Many of them hosted outdoor Christmas markets, which were\nbustling despite the soggy weather. One collection of huts surrounded St.\nStephen's Cathedral, a Vienna icon with its soaring spire and mosaic roof.\n\nIn a city synonymous with classical music and timeless elegance, what better\nway to close out a great day than with a Champagne reception and evening\nconcert at the aristocratic Palais Liechtenstein. Indeed, our Vienna visit\nreached a crescendo when the 10-piece Vienna Imperial Orchestra played\nexclusively for Scenic travelers in a palatial room crowned with a celestial\nceiling. Besides orchestral selections like Mozart's \"A Little Night Music\"\nand \"Voices of Spring Waltz\" by Johann Strauss, we were entertained by\noperatic singers and a ballet duo.\n\nRain followed us to Budapest, our final stop, where the Scenic Amber docked\nacross from the Hungarian Parliament, the grandiose landmark often shown on\nriver cruise brochures and TV commercials. After the \"Jewish Heritage\" tour, I\nhad free time to check out the Christmas market by St. Stephen's Basilica,\nthen ventured inside the massive church to find a Christmas-themed service\nbeing conducted, curiously, in English.\n\nFor our final dinner onboard, we had marvelous views of the floodlit\nParliament, a lasting memory of a great city and the best gift Santa could\ndeliver - a Christmastime cruise through the heart of Europe\n\n_________________________________________\n\nNow is not too early to book a Christmas cruise for 2020; our ship sailed\nfull.

    "html": "<p>By <person>RANDY MINK</person></p>\n<p>Special to the Journal &amp; Topics</p>\n\n<p>I didn't exactly have visions of sugar plums dancing in my head, but during last December's <location>Danube River</location> cruise featuring the Christmas markets of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Central Europe</location>, I certainly got my fill of gingerbread, strudel and spiced wine. Like a kid anticipating Christmas morning, I looked forward to every stop to see what Santa had in store ashore.</p>\n\n<p>On port calls in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/at\">Austria</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/hu\">Hungary</location>, I and fellow passengers on the Scenic Amber reveled in traipsing through the temporary shopping villages that take over the historic hearts of cities like Nuremburg, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna</location> every November and December. It was magical soaking in the yuletide mirth while nibbling goodies, imbibing warm beverages and shopping for gifts from vendors in their snug little huts. Waiting for us after the tours was a sleek river ship that spoiled us rotten.</p>\n\n<p>Besides merriment ashore, the conviviality onboard, in keeping with the season, seemed to be turned up a notch. Our jolly English cruise director set the tone, as did the rest of the staff, most of them from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LB/eeur\">Eastern Europe</location>.</p>\n\n<p>At most destinations we had a choice of three or four tours, with one or more including a seasonal market. With <chron>Christmas Day</chron> gift giving just days away, we felt a heightened sense of mission prowling the lanes of stalls filled with foods and handicrafts distinctive to this part of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Our one-week \"Danube Christmas Markets\" adventure on the Scenic Amber, one of 13 river ships operated in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location> by <org>Scenic Luxury Cruises &amp; Tours</org>, started, appropriately, in the Bavarian city of Nuremburg (pop. 530,000), home to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany's</location> biggest and most famous Christmas market. We then sailed to Regensburg and Passau before calling at four Austrian cities - Linz, Melk, Durnstein and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna</location>. The holiday fling ended in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/hu..bupest\">Budapest, Hungary</location>, two days before Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>Come Advent season in <location>Nuremburg's Old Town</location>, row after row of huts trimmed in candy cane-striped awnings crowd the cobbled plaza by the Church of Our Lady. Many Scenic Amber passengers took the city tour that included the Christkindlesmarkt, a Nuremburg tradition since 1628. Drifting among the 170 stalls, they shopped for handmade ornaments, wooden toys, nutcrackers, candles, soaps and other artisan wares. Among the must-try foods and drinks: wine mulled with spices like cinnamon and cloves (Gluhwein), finger-like Nuremburg bratwursts, and all shapes and sizes of the highly spiced gingerbread (Lebkuchen) made with honey, oats and ground nuts (little flour, if any). One tour option featured a gingerbread-baking class.</p>\n\n<p>Regensburg, 53 miles downriver, boasts <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany's</location> largest medieval district, the perfect backdrop for Christmas shopping. Scenic-arranged walking tours in <location>Regensburg's Old Town</location> offered the option of holiday markets in the main square or at <location>St. Emmeram Palace</location>, the ancestral home of Regensburg's princely Thurn und Taxis family. Every year the family, the largest private landowners in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/de\">Germany</location>, hosts a first-rate market. My group had time to peruse the stalls before and after a tour of the palace, an important monastery in the Middle Ages.</p>\n\n<p>Around the courtyard's Christmas tree and across the grounds, wood fires kept us warm as we stood at tables with hot drinks (though the outdoor temperature that afternoon was a not-so-bad 48 degrees). Each tour member received a voucher good for one cup at a Gluhwein stand. Throughout the cruise, passengers had fun collecting these souvenir cups inscribed with the year and name of the market (instead of returning them for the deposit). With my blueberry-flavored wine I had a piece of chocolate-covered gingerbread with almonds. If only there had been room in my tummy for the crepes or waffles, the hot chestnuts or candied mixed nuts, or the apple strudel in vanilla sauce.</p>\n\n<p>Every merchant's stall at the Thurn und Taxis estate offered something different, whether it was colorful knitwear, Russian stacking dolls or carved-wood Nativity sets and figurines. As the sun set, the marketplace turned into a wonderland lit by candles, lanterns and torches. A brass band entertained from a courtyard balcony.</p>\n\n<p>From the German city of Passau, 85 miles southeast of Regensburg, cruise passengers boarded tour buses for <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg, Austria</location>, or Cesky Krumlov, a picture-perfect Czech town with sloping medieval streets. I chose <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg</location>, having gained an affection for the city while living there as a student long ago.</p>\n\n<p>After all these years, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg's</location> <location>Old Town</location>, with fairy-tale castle perched high above, looks just the way I remember it. And the city still plays up its ties to \"The Sound of Music,\" the 1965 movie classic starring <person>Julie Andrews</person>, as many scenes were filmed in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg</location> and environs, home base of the singing <person>von Trapp</person> family.</p>\n\n<p>Our <location>Old Town</location> walking tour featured \"Sound of Music\" locations, beautiful churches and the city's other big claim to fame - the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus <person>Mozart</person>. For old times' sake, I bought a bag and box of Mozartkugeln - balls of dark chocolate-coated candy layered with pistachio marzipan and dark and light praline cream. Each piece is wrapped in gold foil bearing the composer's portrait.</p>\n\n<p>You'll find Mozartkugeln at the Salzburg Christmas Market, where, after lunch, we had time to browse the huts clustered on squares fronting the Cathedral and Residenz, the 17th-century palace of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg's</location> <person>prince</person>-archbishops. Lunch was not just anywhere - Scenic reserved for us one of the 11 vaulted dining rooms at the oldest restaurant in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location>, St. Peter Stiftkulinarium. Ensconced in the cave-like cliff by the sumptuous <location>Baroque St.</location> Peter's Abbey, it has been dishing up food since 803.</p>\n\n<p>From <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..slzbrg\">Salzburg</location>, buses took us to Linz, where our ship was waiting to welcome us back. Instead of having dinner onboard, I walked over to the Christmas market in the main square, 10 minutes away.</p>\n\n<p>The Scenic Amber's lounge, decked out for the holidays during our December sailing, bubbled with Christmas cheer when we gathered for port talks, entertainment and games. It didn't hurt that alcoholic drinks were complimentary day and night. (A Scenic cruise is all-inclusive, meaning the fare covers beverages, meals, shore excursions, Wi-Fi, gratuities and airport transfers.)</p>\n\n<p>Local performers brought onboard included a Bavarian brass band and Austrian and Hungarian folk dancers. One night passengers split into teams for Christmas trivia.</p>\n\n<p>The ship's dining room served specialties representative of the countries we visited. Among choices on our dinner menu in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna</location>, for example, were wiener schnitzel and apple strudel. A mini-smorgasbord in the lounge that night presented more Austrian favorites - pretzels and pretzel rolls, frankfurters with mustard, goulash soup and Kaiserschmarren (shredded sweet pancakes) with applesauce.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of passengers on our sailing were Americans. Other guests came from <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/jp\">Japan</location>.</p>\n\n<p>After Linz, our next stop was Melk, where we had a morning tour of Melk Abbey, a majestic Baroque building overlooking the Danube. On the way to Durnstein, a charming <location>Wachau Valley</location> village two hours from Melk, we had one of the few daytime chances to go out on deck and watch the scenery pass by. It was cool and breezy, and for the first time on the trip I took out my hat and gloves. In Durnstein, noted for its romantic castle ruins perched above town, we had two hours to shop and poke around the cobbled lanes.</p>\n\n<p>Our day in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna</location> was split between morning excursions and afternoon free time. I opted to visit <location>Schonbrunn Palace</location>, the 1,441-room summer home of the Hapsburg rulers. After an hour touring the <location>Royal Apartments</location>, there was time for shopping and noshing at the extensive Christmas market in the forecourt. Some of us went to the apple strudel-making demonstration (\"Strudelshow\") in the palace's cafe building.</p>\n\n<p>It started raining just after we left Schonbrunn, but rather than head back to the ship, I toughed it out, umbrella in hand, and spent the next five hours exploring <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna's</location> history-rich Inner City. The weather dampened some plans but not mine, as I was determined to see the monumental sights remembered from visits long ago. Many of them hosted outdoor Christmas markets, which were bustling despite the soggy weather. One collection of huts surrounded <org>St. Stephen's Cathedral</org>, a <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna</location> icon with its soaring spire and mosaic roof.</p>\n\n<p>In a city synonymous with classical music and timeless elegance, what better way to close out a great day than with a Champagne reception and evening concert at the aristocratic Palais Liechtenstein. Indeed, our <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/at..vienna\">Vienna</location> visit reached a crescendo when the 10-piece <org>Vienna Imperial Orchestra</org> played exclusively for Scenic travelers in a palatial room crowned with a celestial ceiling. Besides orchestral selections like <person>Mozart</person>'s \"A <person>Little Night Music</person>\" and \"Voices of Spring Waltz\" by <person>Johann Strauss</person>, we were entertained by operatic singers and a ballet duo.</p>\n\n<p>Rain followed us to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/hu..bupest\">Budapest</location>, our final stop, where the Scenic Amber docked across from the Hungarian Parliament, the grandiose landmark often shown on river cruise brochures and TV commercials. After the \"Jewish Heritage\" tour, I had free time to check out the Christmas market by St. Stephen's Basilica, then ventured inside the massive church to find a Christmas-themed service being conducted, curiously, in English.</p>\n\n<p>For our final dinner onboard, we had marvelous views of the floodlit <org>Parliament</org>, a lasting memory of a great city and the best gift Santa could deliver - a Christmastime cruise through the heart of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LR/eur\">Europe</location></p>\n\n<p>_________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>Now is not too early to book a Christmas cruise for 2020; our ship sailed full.
