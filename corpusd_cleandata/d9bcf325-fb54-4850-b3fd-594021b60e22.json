    "text": "What do bridge crews from the Wayne County Engineer's Office (WCEO) do in the\nwinter when they aren't busy plowing roads?\n\nBuild bridges.\n\nSince installing steel forms in 2003 on-site at the WCEO's bridge bay to build\nconcrete beams and blocks, employees have been busy each winter producing\nbridge components to be installed the following summer. And it has added up to\nquite a savings.\n\n\"Installing pre-cast wingwall instead of cast-in-place wingwall can save three\nto four days construction time,\" Wayne County Engineer Scott Miller said. \"The\ntime saved from a few projects can potentially be used to replace a different\nbridge.\"\n\nIn addition to saving time, Miller explained that for every project sold to a\ncontractor, the WCEO could use the same contractor cost to build two in-house\nprojects.\n\nBridges deteriorate over time due to environmental factors, traffic vibration\nand chemical compounds. Cracks in bridges are made worse when moisture\ncollects in them and freezes during the winter months. In some cases, a\nstructure is weakened when the streambed changes course and erodes the soil\naround the foundation.\n\n\"Basically, we pre-cast concrete bridge members. There are several members to\na bridge, including the abutment blocks and wingwall to rebuild a bridge,\"\nMiller said. \"It saves a lot of money and time. It also allows our employees\nto continue working during winter months. The structure designs and pre-\nfabrication are all done in-house.\"\n\nWayne County is home to 490 bridges, ranking it the third highest in bridge\ncount out of all 88 counties in the state, according to Wayne County Bridge\nEngineer Eric K. Liew.\n\n\"Fracture critical bridges are non-redundant bridge structures that consist of\nonly two main supporting members. Failure of one main member will cause the\nbridge to collapse,\" Liew said. \"We have 43 fracture critical bridges, 54\nbridges rated in poor condition and 65 posted bridges with load limits.\"\n\nThe WCEO's goals are to replace fracture critical bridges with a redundant\nsuperstructure, replace poor condition bridges and reduce the number of posted\nbridges.\n\n\"The challenge is that we do not have enough funds to take care of the\nexisting bridge issues,\" Liew continued.\n\nAnother challenge Liew and his colleagues face is the soil composition at many\nbridge locations throughout the county differs. The various soil types create\nthe need to conduct soil borings to determine the bearing capacity for each\nbridge replacement project.\n\nBridge crew members pour from 36 to 56 blocks each winter under the\nsupervision of 16-year crew veteran Pat Miller.\n\n\"The variation is based on the creek depth. The deeper the creek, the more\nblock pieces are to be cast,\" Liew said. \"In the 2019-20 winter season, we\ncast about 60 blocks.\"\n\nWCEO's pre-casting form is fixed with a two-foot width by two-foot height\nsquare block to save money, confusion, and to simplify the casting operation.\nThe length of the block varies and can be adjusted as needed.\n\nDan Starcher is a public communications specialist for the Wayne County\ngovernment.\n\nCREDIT: DAN STARCHER",

    "html": "<p>What do bridge crews from the Wayne County Engineer&#8217;s Office (WCEO) do in the winter when they aren&#8217;t busy plowing roads? </p><p>Build bridges. </p><p>Since installing steel forms in 2003 on-site at the WCEO&#8217;s bridge bay to build concrete beams and blocks, employees have been busy each winter producing bridge components to be installed the following summer. And it has added up to quite a savings. </p><p>&#8220;Installing pre-cast wingwall instead of cast-in-place wingwall can save three to four days construction time,&#8221; Wayne County Engineer <person>Scott Miller</person> said. &#8220;The time saved from a few projects can potentially be used to replace a different bridge.&#8221; </p><p>In addition to saving time, Miller explained that for every project sold to a contractor, the WCEO could use the same contractor cost to build two in-house projects. </p><p>Bridges deteriorate over time due to environmental factors, traffic vibration and chemical compounds. Cracks in bridges are made worse when moisture collects in them and freezes during the winter months. In some cases, a structure is weakened when the streambed changes course and erodes the soil around the foundation. </p><p>&#8220;Basically, we pre-cast concrete bridge members. There are several members to a bridge, including the abutment blocks and wingwall to rebuild a bridge,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;It saves a lot of money and time. It also allows our employees to continue working during winter months. The structure designs and pre-fabrication are all done in-house.&#8221; </p><p>Wayne County is home to 490 bridges, ranking it the third highest in bridge count out of all 88 counties in the state, according to Wayne County Bridge Engineer <person>Eric K. Liew</person>. </p><p>&#8220;Fracture critical bridges are non-redundant bridge structures that consist of only two main supporting members. Failure of one main member will cause the bridge to collapse,&#8221; Liew said. &#8220;We have 43 fracture critical bridges, 54 bridges rated in poor condition and 65 posted bridges with load limits.&#8221; </p><p>The WCEO&#8217;s goals are to replace fracture critical bridges with a redundant superstructure, replace poor condition bridges and reduce the number of posted bridges. </p><p>&#8220;The challenge is that we do not have enough funds to take care of the existing bridge issues,&#8221; Liew continued. </p><p>Another challenge Liew and his colleagues face is the soil composition at many bridge locations throughout the county differs. The various soil types create the need to conduct soil borings to determine the bearing capacity for each bridge replacement project. </p><p>Bridge crew members pour from 36 to 56 blocks each winter under the supervision of 16-year crew veteran <person>Pat Miller</person>. </p><p>&#8220;The variation is based on the creek depth. The deeper the creek, the more block pieces are to be cast,&#8221; Liew said. &#8220;In the 2019-20 winter season, we cast about 60 blocks.&#8221; </p><p>WCEO&#8217;s pre-casting form is fixed with a two-foot width by two-foot height square block to save money, confusion, and to simplify the casting operation. The length of the block varies and can be adjusted as needed. </p><p><person>Dan Starcher</person> is a public communications specialist for the Wayne County government. </p><p>CREDIT: <person>DAN STARCHER</person></p>",
