    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has temporarily made open houses a thing of the past, to\navoid prospective buyers walking through homes.\n\nHowever, some sales professionals are using innovations to help buyers realize\ntheir dream of home ownership.\n\nThe changes have allowed buyers to view homes virtually on their computers,\nlearn about features and make a personal visit only after they secured\nfinancing.\n\nWhen they do visit, they must wear masks. The house is brightly lit and the\ndoors to every closet, bedroom and cabinets are open. The idea is to look, but\ndon't touch.\n\n\"Buyers are vetting the house more than in the past,\" said Mark Bourque,\nfounder and owner of Berkshire Hathaway Epic Real Estate of Kenosha. \"People\nwho want to buy homes are just being more cautious.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is such a sellers' market. If they are interested, buyers must\nmove quickly. Some houses are selling within 72 hours after they are listed on\nthe market. We want to make sure they are pre-qualified to buy a house.\"\n\nLow mortgage rates are helping to fuel the pent-up buying mood. A 30-year-\nfixed rate ranges from 3.25% to 3.37%, according to\n[Bankrate.com](http://Bankrate.com)\n\nHome sales in Kenosha County dropped 7.3% as professionals sold 179 houses in\nApril, 14 fewer than for the same month a year ago, according to the Wisconsin\nRealtors Association.\n\nFor the year, however, sales are up slightly over last year. The WRA reports\nthat 616 houses have been sold in Kenosha County, 11 more the first four\nmonths of last year.\n\nNevertheless, the industry is optimistic for the summer, the peak months for\nhome sales.\n\n\"Real estate is essential, so we are still showing and listing houses. We're\nall working from home, but even though we were faced with a lot of\nuncertainties, us realtors are resilient,\" said Mini Samuel, broker-owner of\nNextHome Signature Group, based in Bristol.\n\n\"We had to think of ways to still continue the real estate business while\nprotecting our clients and their properties.\"\n\nSamuel said she has taken many precautions to ensure the safety of sellers and\nbuyers. If the house is being shown by an agent, no one else is permitted at\nthe same time.\n\nIn some cases, Samuel said, a seller will only show their house if there is a\nbuyer.\n\nAnd when they do visit a house, she said, \"I ask my buyers to wear masks. I\nbring my spray bottle and I spray the door.\"\n\nAdditionally, she has her buyers take off their shoes and put on disposable\nbooties. She has a prominently displayed sign that reads: Boots off or Booties\non. After all this may be your [NextHome].\n\nThe median price in Kenosha County rose to $219,000 in April, up $24,000 or\n12.3% over the same month a year ago.\n\nYear-to-date the median price statewide s risen by $17,050 to $197,050 for the\nsame period last year, according to the WRA.\n\nIN PHOTOS: Kenosha County rocks in face masksMany around the area and state\nhave taken to making homemade face masks to wear during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "html": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has temporarily made open houses a thing of the past, to avoid prospective buyers walking through homes.</p>\n<p>However, some sales professionals are using innovations to help buyers realize their dream of home ownership.</p>\n\n<p>The changes have allowed buyers to view homes virtually on their computers, learn about features and make a personal visit only after they secured financing.</p>\n\n<p>When they do visit, they must wear masks. The house is brightly lit and the doors to every closet, bedroom and cabinets are open. The idea is to look, but don't touch.</p>\n\n<p>\"Buyers are vetting the house more than in the past,\" said <person>Mark Bourque</person>, founder and owner of <org>Berkshire Hathaway Epic Real Estate</org> of Kenosha. \"People who want to buy homes are just being more cautious.\"</p>\n\n<p>He added, \"This is such a sellers' market. If they are interested, buyers must move quickly. Some houses are selling within 72 hours after they are listed on the market. We want to make sure they are pre-qualified to buy a house.\"</p>\n\n<p>Low mortgage rates are helping to fuel the pent-up buying mood. A 30-year-fixed rate ranges from 3.25% to 3.37%, according to <a href=\"http://Bankrate.com\">Bankrate.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Home sales in Kenosha County dropped 7.3% as professionals sold 179 houses in April, 14 fewer than for the same month a year ago, according to the <org>Wisconsin Realtors Association</org>.</p>\n\n<p>For the year, however, sales are up slightly over last year. The WRA reports that 616 houses have been sold in Kenosha County, 11 more the first four months of last year.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the industry is optimistic for the summer, the peak months for home sales.</p>\n\n<p>\"Real estate is essential, so we are still showing and listing houses. We're all working from home, but even though we were faced with a lot of uncertainties, us realtors are resilient,\" said <person>Mini Samuel</person>, broker-owner of <org>NextHome Signature Group</org>, based in Bristol.</p>\n\n<p>\"We had to think of ways to still continue the real estate business while protecting our clients and their properties.\"</p>\n\n<p>Samuel said she has taken many precautions to ensure the safety of sellers and buyers. If the house is being shown by an agent, no one else is permitted at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, Samuel said, a seller will only show their house if there is a buyer.</p>\n\n<p>And when they do visit a house, she said, \"I ask my buyers to wear masks. I bring my spray bottle and I spray the door.\"</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, she has her buyers take off their shoes and put on disposable booties. She has a prominently displayed sign that reads: Boots off or Booties on. After all this may be your [NextHome].</p>\n\n<p>The median price in Kenosha County rose to <money>$219,000</money> in April, up <money>$24,000</money> or 12.3% over the same month a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>Year-to-date the median price statewide s risen by <money>$17,050</money> to <money>$197,050</money> for the same period last year, according to the WRA.</p>\n\n<p>IN PHOTOS: Kenosha County rocks in face masksMany around the area and state have taken to making homemade face masks to wear during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>",
