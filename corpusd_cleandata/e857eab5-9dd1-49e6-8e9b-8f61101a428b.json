    "text": "Iowans learned some things in Tuesday's primary election, and not just whose\nnames will be on the November ballot.\n\nIt became clear that there's more than one way to run an election.\n\nVoting in the 2020 June primary didn't look much like voting ever has before.\nIn Dubuque County, fewer than 1,800 of the nearly 70,000 registered voters\nwent to the polls. Nearly 10 times that number found another way to exercise\ntheir right to vote.\n\nMore than 17,000 voters submitted absentee ballots via mail or did curbside\nvoting in advance of Election Day in an attempt to avoid contact with others\nduring the pandemic.\n\nA push toward absentee voting came from both the Iowa Secretary of State's\nOffice as well as county elections officials. The effort was effective: More\nabsentee ballots were cast in the local primary than in any general election.\n\nIowa's effort followed April elections in Wisconsin during which voters stood\nin long lines waiting to vote, risking their own health and potentially that\nof poll workers. Dozens of cases of COVID-19 were traced back to Wisconsin's\nelection day.\n\nThanks to early and absentee voting and heightened awareness, Iowa's\nexperience was visibly different. Dubuque County limited in-person voting to\nnine polling places in the county, down from 35. That way, far fewer poll\nworkers were required. The TH observed that, at many locations, there was\nrarely more than one voter inside at a time Tuesday.\n\nStatewide, Iowa recorded a record turnout for a primary election, even with\nfar fewer voters going to the polls on Tuesday. More than 410,000 Iowans voted\nabsentee this year, compared to just 38,000 in the 2016 primary election.\n\nA virtual high-five to Iowa voters who helped keep each other safe, protected\npoll workers and still managed to cast a record number of ballots. It's a good\nexample that sometimes trying out a new way of doing things leads to positive\nchange.\n\nAnother thing Iowans decided it was time to change gets even more acclamation\n- Western Iowa voters finally sent the message that U.S. Rep. Steve King does\nnot represent Iowa.\n\nIt was particularly fitting that this week, when the nation is immersed in\nconversation about racial inequality, voters in the state stepped away from\nthe nine-term Republican congressman who has voiced some of the most blatantly\nracist comments ever uttered by anyone in public life.\n\nKing's hits list includes questioning why \"white nationalism\" and \"white\nsupremacy\" are offensive phrases and asking what any other group besides white\npeople has ever contributed to civilization. He once said, \"What does this\ndiversity bring that we don't already have? Mexican food, Chinese food, those\nthings - well, that's fine. But what does it bring that we don't have that is\nworth the price? We have a lot of diversity within the U.S. already.\"\n\nAfter years of bigoted comments that showed no understanding of or\nappreciation for cultural equity and inclusivity, King at long last was\nstripped of his congressional committee assignments last year. It was a move\nlong overdue.\n\nLikewise, to have a bigot as one of Iowa's few representatives on the national\nstage for 18 years was a legacy that went on too long. King has caused the\nstate enough pain and embarrassment. We're glad the people of western Iowa\nhave finally taken away his position of influence.\n\nLast week in this space we warned readers not to toss out that prepaid Visa\ncard if you get one in the mail because it just might be your federal stimulus\naid.\n\nOne week later, elected officials on the state and national level are making\nan effort to assist those who might have done just that.\n\nAt the federal level, Iowa Reps. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne were pressing\nthe U.S. Treasury to waive fees that citizens would incur if they needed a\nreplacement card. Additionally, the lawmakers hoped to increase the amount a\ntaxpayer can transfer to a bank account.\n\nTheir message was heard.\n\nThe IRS announced it would waive the $7.50 fee for the replacement card and\nincrease the limit on the amount a taxpayer can transfer to a bank account\nfrom $1,000 per calendar month to $2,500.\n\nIowa Attorney General Tom Miller's office also worked on behalf of Iowans to\nease the process.\n\nMiller said his office had taken hundreds of calls from consumers needing\nassistance with lost or discarded cards. That led the state to install a live\ncustomer service telephone line. To replace a lost card, Iowans can call\n800-240-8100, press \"2\" when prompted for a lost or stolen card and enter the\nlast six digits of their Social Security number.\n\nCredit to these elected officials who helped Iowans navigate this unusual\nproblem.\n\nEditorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board.\n\nWhere we stand\n\nKudos to Iowans who votes safely and in record numbers in this week's primary\nelection.",

    "html": "<p>Iowans learned some things in Tuesday's primary election, and not just whose names will be on the November ballot.</p>\n<p>It became clear that there's more than one way to run an election.</p>\n<p>Voting in the 2020 June primary didn't look much like voting ever has before. In <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.dubque\">Dubuque County</location>, fewer than 1,800 of the nearly 70,000 registered voters went to the polls. Nearly 10 times that number found another way to exercise their right to vote.</p>\n<p>More than 17,000 voters submitted absentee ballots via mail or did curbside voting in advance of <chron>Election Day</chron> in an attempt to avoid contact with others during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>A push toward absentee voting came from both the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location> Secretary of State's Office as well as county elections officials. The effort was effective: More absentee ballots were cast in the local primary than in any general election.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa's</location> effort followed April elections in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin</location> during which voters stood in long lines waiting to vote, risking their own health and potentially that of poll workers. Dozens of cases of COVID-19 were traced back to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.wi\">Wisconsin's</location> <chron>election day</chron>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to early and absentee voting and heightened awareness, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa's</location> experience was visibly different. <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ia.dubque\">Dubuque County</location> limited in-person voting to nine polling places in the county, down from 35. That way, far fewer poll workers were required. The TH observed that, at many locations, there was rarely more than one voter inside at a time Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Statewide, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location> recorded a record turnout for a primary election, even with far fewer voters going to the polls on Tuesday. More than 410,000 Iowans voted absentee this year, compared to just 38,000 in the 2016 primary election.</p>\n<p>A virtual high-five to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location> voters who helped keep each other safe, protected poll workers and still managed to cast a record number of ballots. It's a good example that sometimes trying out a new way of doing things leads to positive change.</p>\n<p>Another thing Iowans decided it was time to change gets even more acclamation - <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Western Iowa</location> voters finally sent the message that <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> Rep. <person>Steve King</person> does not represent <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location>.</p>\n<p>It was particularly fitting that this week, when the nation is immersed in conversation about racial inequality, voters in the state stepped away from the nine-term Republican congressman who has voiced some of the most blatantly racist comments ever uttered by anyone in public life.</p>\n<p>King's hits list includes questioning why \"white nationalism\" and \"white supremacy\" are offensive phrases and asking what any other group besides white people has ever contributed to civilization. He once said, \"What does this diversity bring that we don't already have? Mexican food, Chinese food, those things - well, that's fine. But what does it bring that we don't have that is worth the price? We have a lot of diversity within the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> already.\"</p>\n<p>After years of bigoted comments that showed no understanding of or appreciation for cultural equity and inclusivity, King at long last was stripped of his congressional committee assignments last year. It was a move long overdue.</p>\n<p>Likewise, to have a bigot as one of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa's</location> few representatives on the national stage for 18 years was a legacy that went on too long. King has caused the state enough pain and embarrassment. We're glad the people of western <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location> have finally taken away his position of influence.</p>\n<p>Last week in this space we warned readers not to toss out that prepaid <org>Visa</org> card if you get one in the mail because it just might be your federal stimulus aid.</p>\n<p>One week later, elected officials on the state and national level are making an effort to assist those who might have done just that.</p>\n<p>At the federal level, Iowa Reps. <person>Abby Finkenauer</person> and <person>Cindy Axne</person> were pressing the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</location> <org>Treasury</org> to waive fees that citizens would incur if they needed a replacement card. Additionally, the lawmakers hoped to increase the amount a taxpayer can transfer to a bank account.</p>\n<p>Their message was heard.</p>\n<p>The <org>IRS</org> announced it would waive the <money>$7.50</money> fee for the replacement card and increase the limit on the amount a taxpayer can transfer to a bank account from <money>$1,000</money> per calendar month to <money>$2,500</money>.</p>\n<p><location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LS/us.ia\">Iowa</location> Attorney General <person>Tom Miller's</person> office also worked on behalf of Iowans to ease the process.</p>\n<p>Miller said his office had taken hundreds of calls from consumers needing assistance with lost or discarded cards. That led the state to install a live customer service telephone line. To replace a lost card, Iowans can call 800-240-8100, press \"2\" when prompted for a lost or stolen card and enter the last six digits of their <org>Social Security</org> number.</p>\n<p>Credit to these elected officials who helped Iowans navigate this unusual problem.</p>\n<p>Editorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board.</p>\n<p>Where we stand</p>\n<p>Kudos to Iowans who votes safely and in record numbers in this week's primary election.</p>",
