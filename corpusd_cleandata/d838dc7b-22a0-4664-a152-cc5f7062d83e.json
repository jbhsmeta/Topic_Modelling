    "text": "By Mario B. Casayuran\n\nSenator Panfilo M. Lacson on Thursday moved to counter ''massive\ndisinformation'' against his Anti-Terror Bill by saying it is meant to protect\nthe Filipino people as terrorism knows no timing or borders.\n\n''To the critics, I dare say: I hope the day will not come when you or any of\nyour loved ones will be at the receiving end of a terrorist attack, so much so\nthat it will be too late for you to regret convincing the Filipino people to\njunk this landmark legislation,'' Lacson, chairman of the Senate national\ndefense and security committee, said.\n\n''Some of our country's policy-makers, especially our people, should know\nbetter than just criticizing and believing the massive disinformation campaign\nagainst a measure that can secure and protect us as well as our families and\nloved ones from terrorist acts perpetrated in a manner so sudden, least\nexpected and indiscriminate - as in anytime, probably even today, tomorrow or\nnext week,'' he added.\n\nSenate President Vicente C. Sotto III supported Lacson by hitting back at\ncritics of the anti-terror bill, which received massive backlash online since\nit was certified as urgent by President Duterte.\n\nOpposition Senators Risa Hontiveros and Francis N. Pangilinan questioned the\n\"misplaced\" priority in asking the anti-terror bill to be passed urgently.\n\nHontiveros and Pangilinan voted against the bill citing possible abuses once\nenacted into law.\n\nLacson stressed that he was always mindful of the Bill of Rights enshrined in\nthe 1987 Constitution when he conducted the public hearings and sponsored the\nbill on the Senate floor last year up to February where it was approved on\nthird and final reading.\n\n''That said, I incorporated most of the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism laws\nof other strong democracies like Australia and the United States, further\nguided by the standards set by the United Nations, save for the reglamentary\nperiod of detention in which we adopted the shortest time of 14 days -\ncompared to Thailand with up to 30 days; Malaysia, up to two years; Singapore\nat 720 days extendible to an indefinite period of detention without formal\ncharges; and Indonesia, up to 120 additional days. Also, safeguards have been\nput in place to ensure the rights of those detained,'' Lacson explained.\n\n''With the help of many of my colleagues who (conducted) interpellation and\nproposed their individual amendments, including all the members of the\nminority bloc, I was more than accommodating to accept their amendments as\nlong as we would not end up with another dead-letter law such as the Human\nSecurity Act of 2007, which has so far resulted in just one conviction after\nmore than a decade of its implementation and just one proscribed terrorist\norganization such as the Abu Sayyaf Group,'' he added.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nSenator Panfilo Lacson (Senate of the Philippines / FILE PHOTO / MANILA\nBULLETIN)",

    "html": "<p>By <person>Mario B. Casayuran</person></p>\n\n<p>Senator <person>Panfilo M. Lacson</person> on Thursday moved to counter\n''massive disinformation'' against his Anti-Terror\nBill by saying it is meant to protect the Filipino people as terrorism\nknows no timing or borders.</p>\n\n<p>''To the critics, I dare say: I hope the day will not\ncome when you or any of your loved ones will be at the receiving end of\na terrorist attack, so much so that it will be too late for you to\nregret convincing the Filipino people to junk this landmark\nlegislation,'' Lacson, chairman of the <org>Senate</org> national defense\nand security committee, said.</p>\n\n<p>''Some of our country's policy-makers, especially\nour people, should know better than just criticizing and believing the\nmassive disinformation campaign against a measure that can secure and\nprotect us as well as our families and loved ones from terrorist acts\nperpetrated in a manner so sudden, least expected and indiscriminate -\nas in anytime, probably even today, tomorrow or next week,''\nhe added.</p>\n\n<p><org>Senate</org> President <person>Vicente C. Sotto III</person> supported Lacson by hitting\nback at critics of the anti-terror bill, which received massive backlash\nonline since it was certified as urgent by <person>President Duterte</person>.</p>\n\n<p>Opposition Senators <person>Risa Hontiveros</person> and <person>Francis N. Pangilinan</person>\nquestioned the \"misplaced\" priority in asking the anti-terror\nbill to be passed urgently.</p>\n\n<p>Hontiveros and Pangilinan voted against the bill citing possible\nabuses once enacted into law.</p>\n\n<p>Lacson stressed that he was always mindful of the Bill of Rights\nenshrined in the 1987 <org>Constitution</org> when he conducted the public hearings\nand sponsored the bill on the <org>Senate</org> floor last year up to February\nwhere it was approved on third and final reading.</p>\n\n<p>''That said, I incorporated most of the provisions of the\nAnti-Terrorism laws of other strong democracies like <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/au\">Australia</location> and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the\nUnited States</location>, further guided by the standards set by the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0292736459\">United\nNations</org>, save for the reglamentary period of detention in which we\nadopted the shortest time of 14 days - compared to <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/th\">Thailand</location> with up to\n30 days; <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/my\">Malaysia</location>, up to two years; <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/sg\">Singapore</location> at 720 days extendible to\nan indefinite period of detention without formal charges; and <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/id\">Indonesia</location>,\nup to 120 additional days. Also, safeguards have been put in place to\nensure the rights of those detained,'' Lacson explained.</p>\n\n<p>''With the help of many of my colleagues who (conducted)\ninterpellation and proposed their individual amendments, including all\nthe members of the minority bloc, I was more than accommodating to\naccept their amendments as long as we would not end up with another\ndead-letter law such as the Human Security Act of 2007, which has so far\nresulted in just one conviction after more than a decade of its\nimplementation and just one proscribed terrorist organization such as\nthe <org>Abu Sayyaf Group</org>,'' he added.</p>\n\n<p>CAPTION(S):</p>\n\n<p>Senator <person>Panfilo Lacson</person> (<org>Senate</org> of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/ph\">the Philippines</location> / FILE PHOTO /\n<location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/ph..manila\">MANILA</location> BULLETIN)</p>",
