    "text": "Raleigh: University of North Carolina at Greensboro has issued the following\nnews release:\n\nOn Wednesday, June 3, Moss Street Partnership School staff and administration\nrecognized 62 fifth-grade students in a \"Moving Up\" promotion ceremony to\ncelebrate the students' transition from elementary to middle school.\n\nThis is the second year the school, operated by UNC Greensboro in partnership\nwith Rockingham County Schools, has been in operation. Last year, the\ninaugural graduating class included 59 students.\n\nIn the absence of a face-to-face event, families decorated their cars for the\ncelebratory drive-thru of the Moss Street parking lot, where teachers\npresented each student with end-of-year awards, promotion certificates, and a\nspecial memory book. The book was printed from a digital project students and\nteachers created since transitioning to remote learning earlier in the school\nyear.\n\n\"Moss Street is a special place, with state-of-the-art resources and world-\nclass teachers,\" said UNCG Chancellor Franklin D. Gilliam, Jr. \"It is also\nhome to a special group of students, rising sixth graders who have\ndemonstrated their commitment to learning despite the challenges of remote\ninstruction. We applaud your achievement and are excited to see a second class\nof graduates advance to the next level of their academic journey. Thank you to\nthe families for their support, and to the exceptional partnership we have\nwith Rockingham County Schools and the Moss Street community.\"\n\nLocated in Rockingham County, North Carolina, Moss Street is a school for\nkindergarten through fifth graders emphasizing experiential learning that is\nauthentic, active, learner-centered, challenging, and literacy-rich.",
