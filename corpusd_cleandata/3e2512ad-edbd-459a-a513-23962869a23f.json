    "text": "Islamabad, June 5 (IANS) The Pakistan government has sought an explanation\nfrom the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for writing a letter to the Pakistan\nInternational Airlines (PIA), which suggested the pilot of the plane that\ncrashed in Karachi did not follow the instructions of air-traffic controllers\n(ATC).\n\n\"We have sought an explanation from the CAA official (for writing a letter to\nPIA implying that the pilot of the PK-8303 flight did not follow the\ninstructions of ATC,\" said Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan at a press\nconference on Thursday.\n\n\"As long as the inquiry report is not finalised, the official in question\nshould not have spoken up (publicly). Whatever the official/CAA had to say\nshould have been told to the four-member inquiry board probing the crash.\"\n\nHe was visiting the provincial capital to condole with the families of the PIA\ncrew members who lost their lives in the air crash on May 22 that claimed the\nlives of 97 people, reports Dawn news.\n\nThe Minister said that perhaps the CAA thought whatever was written in the\nletter was correct.\n\n\"However, an explanation has been called in this regard,\" he added.\n\nThe June 2 letter sent by CAA official Iftikhar Ahmed to the PIA's safety and\nquality assurance department, while pointing out \"non-compliance of ATC\ninstructions\" by the pilot of the ill-fated aircraft, had asked it to ensure\nthat such a situation was not repeated in future.\n\nThe Minister said the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were\nwith the French team that visited Pakistan and data from the two recorders had\nsuccessfully been downloaded.\n\nThe government would make the preliminary report about the crash public on\nJune 22.\n\n\\--IANS\n\nksk/",
