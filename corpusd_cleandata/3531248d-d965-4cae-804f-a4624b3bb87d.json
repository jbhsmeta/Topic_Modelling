    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 5 \\-- Ohio State Auditor Keith Faber issued the following\nnews release:\n\nAuditor of State Keith Faber's office released a special audit of the City of\nLima Municipal Court, which issued $334,270 in findings for recovery against\nformer Chief Deputy Sue Barnett.\n\n\"Diligent local officials and the hardworking people of our Special\nInvestigations Unit brought justice to this gross abuse of public trust,\"\nAuditor Faber said. \"The City of Lima deserves better and I trust that better\nchecks in balances have been put in place.\"\n\nOn May 31, 2017, the Auditor's office declared a special audit of the Lima\nMunicipal Court after receiving a credible allegation of theft by the current\nClerk of Court, Jim Link. Based on preliminary investigations, auditors\ndetermined the scope of the audit to be from January 1, 2009 through June 30,\n2012.\n\nAs Deputy Chief, Barnett was responsible for managing the cashiers working for\nthe court. As manager, her job was to ensure each cashier's batches for the\nday agreed with their respective cash drawer. She would then prepare a Daily\nCash Drawer Worksheet, which listed the date, batch number, batch totals, list\nof checks received, total checks received, cash in drawer amount, and total\ndeposit. She would then take the deposit to the bank. This allowed Barnett to\nhave control over all phases of each transaction.\n\nThe audit period contained 655 deposits, totaling $6,667,336. Of the 665\ndeposits, 495 of them included misappropriated cash totaling $96,009. The\nfollowing table breaks down this amount by year:\n\n\\- View table here: (<http://ohioauditor.gov/news/pressreleases/Details/5477>)\n\nThe court conducted their own audit of Barnett, which included an audit period\nfrom January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2008. That audit identified $238,699\nin misappropriated cash.\n\nOn April 18, 2019, Barnett appeared before Judge Jeffery L. Redd and pled\nguilty to Theft in Office, a felony of the third degree, and to\ntelecommunications fraud, a felony of the third degree.\n\nOn September 5, 2019, Barnett agreed to a restitution amount of $331,706 based\non both our audit and the internal audit conducted by the court.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, Judge Reed sentenced Barnett to 36 months in prison for\neach count, to be served concurrently. In addition, Reed ordered restitution\nof $331,706 against Barnett and in favor of Lima Municipal Court.\n\nIn accordance with the facts uncovered in the special audit and pursuant to\nthe court order, Auditor Faber issued a finding for recovery for $95,571\nagainst Barnett for misappropriating cash during the period the Auditor's\noffice examined.\n\nAuditor Faber also issued a finding against Barnett for $238,699 for\nmisappropriated cash covering the period January 1, 1997 through December 31,\n2008.\n\nFormer Clerk of Court Robert Holmes was responsible for paying over and\naccounting for these funds coming into the court as required by law from\nJanuary 1, 1997 to December 31, 2007. Therefore, Robert Holmes is jointly and\nseverally liable for $198,569 total. Also, Ben Diepenbrock, the Clerk of Court\nwho held the same responsibilities as Holmes from January 16, 2008 to June 30,\n2012 is jointly and severally liable for $134,284.\n\nA full copy of this audit can be accessed through this link:\n(<http://ohioauditor.gov/news/pressreleases/Details/5477>)",

Based on preliminary investigations, auditors determined the scope of the audit to be from <chron>January 1, 2009</chron> through <chron>June 30, 2012</chron>.</p><p>As Deputy Chief, Barnett was responsible for managing the cashiers working for the court. As manager, her job was to ensure each cashier's batches for the day agreed with their respective cash drawer. She would then prepare a Daily Cash Drawer Worksheet, which listed the date, batch number, batch totals, list of checks received, total checks received, cash in drawer amount, and total deposit. She would then take the deposit to the bank. This allowed Barnett to have control over all phases of each transaction.</p><p>The audit period contained 655 deposits, totaling <money>$6,667,336</money>. Of the 665 deposits, 495 of them included misappropriated cash totaling <money>$96,009</money>.
