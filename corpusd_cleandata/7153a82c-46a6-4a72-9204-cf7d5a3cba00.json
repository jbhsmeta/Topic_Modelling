    "text": "In 2014, a tiered network of facilities to manage patients with Ebola virus\ndisease (EVD) was established in the United States (1). The Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention designated 56 hospitals as Ebola treatment\ncenters (ETCs), each equipped with specified capabilities to provide safe\nhigh-level isolation care for patients with EVD. This network was enhanced\nwith the later designation of 10 regional Ebola and other special pathogen\ntreatment centers (RESPTCs) with enhanced capabilities to care for patients\nwith other highly hazardous communicable diseases (HHCDs). Since that time,\nefforts have been made to expand existing ETC capabilities beyond EVD in\npreparation for treating the next HHCD outbreak.\n\nPrevious assessments of these 56 ETCs by our team found average costs incurred\nto train teams, enhance physical infrastructure, and acquire advanced\nresources totaled nearly $1.2 million/facility (2). Despite these major\ninvestments, only 15-18 months after initially establishing their ETCs, by\n2016 most hospitals reported challenges in sustaining ETC capabilities, and 3\ncenters reported they no longer maintained preparedness for EVD care (3).\n\nNow, 3.5 years after our last ETC assessment, these specialized units face\nintensified threats to their sustainability because federal funding of these\ncenters through the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) Ebola Preparedness and\nResponse Activities is set to expire in 2020 (4). We aimed to determine\nwhether additional costs for ETCs have incurred since our assessment in 2015,\nas well as to assess hospitals' sustainability plans for maintaining\ncapabilities after federal funding ceases.\n\nThe Study\n\nIn April 2019, we sent a link to an electronic survey (Indiana University\nInstitutional Review Board exemption #1903160012) by email to representatives\nfrom the 56 ETCs. Three additional email attempts were made to nonresponding\nETCs through survey closing in June. We collected and analyzed data by using\nQualtrics (<https://www.qualtrics.com>) software and exported them for\ndescriptive statistical analyses.\n\nA total of 37 (66%) ETCs responded. However, the ability to skip questions\nresulted in differing response rates within the survey. Three hospitals that\nhad previously reported they no longer held ETC designation were still listed\nas ETCs and were therefore included in survey invitations. However, none\nresponded. All but 1 of the remaining respondents reported they had maintained\nsome degree of ETC capabilities. The 1 decommissioned ETC cited a lack of\nfunding and diminished perceived threat of EVD as factors that led to\nreversion to a regular unit. The other 36 ETCs sustained their high-level\nisolation capabilities (Figure).\n\nWe compiled details of costs incurred by facilities since their 2014\nestablishment (Table). Of the 35 facilities that completed the reimbursement\nsection, 29 (83%) reported they had received reimbursement from the federal\ngovernment and 3 (9%) from the state government for costs in establishing or\nmaintaining their unit. A total of 23 facilities reported total reimbursement\namounts by the federal and state governments to date, totaling $26,546,545\n(average $1,154,198/ ETC). A total of 21 ETCs reported total costs and\nreimbursement received as of June 2019; these facilities had expended, on\naverage, $612,664 more than their reimbursements. When we excluded federally\nfunded RESPTCs, this figure increased to $753,015.\n\nOf the 34 ETCs that reported primary funding mechanisms for sustaining unit\noperations, most cited federal (n = 30, 88%) and institutional (hospital) (n =\n28, 82%) funding. A total of 21 (58%) ETCs reported capabilities would be\nmaintained after HPP funds expire in 2020; 3 (8%) reported they would no\nlonger maintain capabilities after funding expires, and 11 (31%) were\nuncertain if capabilities would be maintained. Of the 21 ETCs that would\nmaintain capabilities, nearly all reported additional funding sources would be\ninternal (n = 17 of 18 hospitals that detailed other funding sources), and 4\nexplicitly noted the desire for state funding to sustain minimal capabilities\nand continued staff training. Of the 11 ETCs that were uncertain if\ncapabilities would remain, all noted their commitment to sustain capabilities\nbut voiced ambiguity as to whether their hospital would be able to provide\nnecessary funding within their budget. When queried if ETC capabilities would\nbe maintained once personal protective equipment (PPE) stocks expire, 27 (77%)\nETCs responded yes and 8 (23%) were uncertain.\n\nMost facilities (n = 26, 76%) used the ETC space as a functional clinical unit\nwhen not activated for HHCD care, most commonly as intensive care unit beds (n\n= 13). Most ETCs have been used for [greater than or equal to] 1 person under\ninvestigation for EVD since June 2014 (n = 22, 63%).\n\nConclusions\n\nThis assessment of ETC costs and sustainability plans is a follow-up to\nfindings from 2015 and 2016 that surveyed the then newly established ETC\nnetwork. Reported costs of establishing ETC capabilities increased by\n>$230,000/ETC from our spring 2015 assessment (2), reflecting the ongoing\nefforts of ETCs to prepare for EVD cases. To date, since establishment in\n2014-2015, an average additional $225,000 has been spent per ETC to maintain\nHHCD care capabilities. Although total ETC costs have increased since our\ninitial assessments (nearly $1.8 million compared with $1.2 million in 2015),\ngaps in reimbursement from federal and state funding have also increased (from\n$650,000 to $750,000 in non-RESPTC ETCs). Since 2016, more ETCs reported using\ntheir unit for routine use when not activated (76% vs. 58%), offsetting\noperational costs.\n\nThis study had limitations. ETC responses were self-reported and not\nvalidated. The survey tool defaulted nonresponses to zeros; therefore, for\nreported maintenance costs, averages for cost subcategories might be inflated\nbecause zeros were considered nonresponses. Since our previous assessment, 22\nfacilities reported new primary contacts; although we reached out to multiple\npersons for each ETC, it is possible personnel from nonresponding facilities\nhave since left their position or hospital. It is also unclear how many\nnonresponding ETCs no longer maintain their capabilities; authors are aware of\nseveral nonresponding hospitals within the network that no longer maintain EVD\ncare capabilities.\n\nSince late 2015, the perceived threat of an HHCD outbreak within the borders\nof the United States has waned, and the perceived demand for numerous US\nhospitals to maintain a high level of preparedness for HHCDs has dwindled. In\ntandem with inadequate funding, more ETCs have elected to forgo high-level\nisolation capabilities. The establishment of RESPTCs sought to centralize\ncapabilities at a regional level, but many ETCs noted that since 2014, major\ninvestments in establishing high-level isolation capabilities could prompt\ncontinued internal financial support if federal funding ceases.\n\nHowever, ETCs reported heavy reliance on federal funding; nearly all reported\nit as their primary funding stream and leading factor in maintaining\ncapabilities. The 2020 expiration of HPP funds threatens the existence of this\nnetwork. It is unknown if--and for how long--many ETCs could maintain\ncapabilities solely with internal financial support, or if the United States\nwill revert to the level of HHCD preparedness before 2014. The ongoing EVD\noutbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the rise of 2019 novel\ncoronavirus disease in China are reminders that HHCD outbreaks are\nincreasingly regular occurrences. The high proportion of ETCs surveyed that\nhave used their ETC for a person under investigation since 2014 (63%) further\nunderscores the ongoing need of such specialized units across the country. The\nUS healthcare system has made major strides in HHCD domestic preparedness\ncapability since 2014. However, on the basis of study responses, the US health\nsystem could again be vulnerable and inadequately prepared for the next HHCD\nthreat if federal HPP funding is not renewed.\n\nDr. Herstein is Regional Director for Sub-Saharan Africa with the Global\nCenter for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center,\nOmaha, NE.

    "html": "<p>In 2014, a tiered network of facilities to manage patients with\nEbola virus disease (EVD) was established in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> (1). The\n<org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</org> designated 56 hospitals as\nEbola treatment centers (ETCs), each equipped with specified\ncapabilities to provide safe high-level isolation care for patients with\nEVD. This network was enhanced with the later designation of 10 regional\nEbola and other special pathogen treatment centers (RESPTCs) with\nenhanced capabilities to care for patients with other highly hazardous\ncommunicable diseases (HHCDs). Since that time, efforts have been made\nto expand existing ETC capabilities beyond EVD in preparation for\ntreating the next HHCD outbreak.</p>\n\n<p>Previous assessments of these 56 ETCs by our team found average\ncosts incurred to train teams, enhance physical infrastructure, and\nacquire advanced resources totaled nearly <money>$1.2 million</money>/facility (2).\nDespite these major investments, only 15-18 months after initially\nestablishing their ETCs, by 2016 most hospitals reported challenges in\nsustaining ETC capabilities, and 3 centers reported they no longer\nmaintained preparedness for EVD care (3).</p>\n\n<p>Now, 3.5 years after our last ETC assessment, these specialized\nunits face intensified threats to their sustainability because federal\nfunding of these centers through the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP)\nEbola Preparedness and Response Activities is set to expire in 2020 (4).\nWe aimed to determine whether additional costs for ETCs have incurred\nsince our assessment in 2015, as well as to assess hospitals'\nsustainability plans for maintaining capabilities after federal funding\nceases.</p>\n\n<p>The Study</p>\n\n<p>In <chron>April 2019</chron>, we sent a link to an electronic survey (<org>Indiana\nUniversity Institutional Review Board</org> exemption #1903160012) by email to\nrepresentatives from the 56 ETCs. Three additional email attempts were\nmade to nonresponding ETCs through survey closing in June. We collected\nand analyzed data by using Qualtrics (<a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com\">https://www.qualtrics.com</a>)\nsoftware and exported them for descriptive statistical analyses.</p>\n\n<p>A total of 37 (66%) ETCs responded. However, the ability to skip\nquestions resulted in differing response rates within the survey. Three\nhospitals that had previously reported they no longer held ETC\ndesignation were still listed as ETCs and were therefore included in\nsurvey invitations. However, none responded. All but 1 of the remaining\nrespondents reported they had maintained some degree of ETC\ncapabilities. The 1 decommissioned ETC cited a lack of funding and\ndiminished perceived threat of EVD as factors that led to reversion to a\nregular unit. The other 36 ETCs sustained their high-level isolation\ncapabilities (Figure).</p>\n\n<p>We compiled details of costs incurred by facilities since their\n2014 establishment (Table). Of the 35 facilities that completed the\nreimbursement section, 29 (83%) reported they had received reimbursement\nfrom the federal government and 3 (9%) from the state government for\ncosts in establishing or maintaining their unit. A total of 23\nfacilities reported total reimbursement amounts by the federal and state\ngovernments to date, totaling <money>$26,546,545</money> (average <money>$1,154,198</money>/ ETC). A\ntotal of 21 ETCs reported total costs and reimbursement received as of\n<chron>June 2019</chron>; these facilities had expended, on average, <money>$612,664</money> more than\ntheir reimbursements. When we excluded federally funded RESPTCs, this\nfigure increased to <money>$753,015</money>.</p>\n\n<p>Of the 34 ETCs that reported primary funding mechanisms for\nsustaining unit operations, most cited federal (n = 30, 88%) and\ninstitutional (hospital) (n = 28, 82%) funding. A total of 21 (58%) ETCs\nreported capabilities would be maintained after HPP funds expire in\n2020; 3 (8%) reported they would no longer maintain capabilities after\nfunding expires, and 11 (31%) were uncertain if capabilities would be\nmaintained. Of the 21 ETCs that would maintain capabilities, nearly all\nreported additional funding sources would be internal (n = 17 of 18\nhospitals that detailed other funding sources), and 4 explicitly noted\nthe desire for state funding to sustain minimal capabilities and\ncontinued staff training. Of the 11 ETCs that were uncertain if\ncapabilities would remain, all noted their commitment to sustain\ncapabilities but voiced ambiguity as to whether their hospital would be\nable to provide necessary funding within their budget. When queried if\nETC capabilities would be maintained once personal protective equipment\n(PPE) stocks expire, 27 (77%) ETCs responded yes and 8 (23%) were\nuncertain.</p>\n\n<p>Most facilities (n = 26, 76%) used the ETC space as a functional\nclinical unit when not activated for HHCD care, most commonly as\nintensive care unit beds (n = 13). Most ETCs have been used for [greater\nthan or equal to] 1 person under investigation for EVD since <chron>June 2014</chron>\n(n = 22, 63%).</p>\n\n<p>Conclusions</p>\n\n<p>This assessment of ETC costs and sustainability plans is a\nfollow-up to findings from 2015 and 2016 that surveyed the then newly\nestablished ETC network. Reported costs of establishing ETC capabilities\nincreased by &gt;<money>$230,000</money>/ETC from our spring 2015 assessment (2),\nreflecting the ongoing efforts of ETCs to prepare for EVD cases. To\ndate, since establishment in 2014-2015, an average additional <money>$225,000</money>\nhas been spent per ETC to maintain HHCD care capabilities. Although\ntotal ETC costs have increased since our initial assessments (nearly\n<money>$1.8 million</money> compared with <money>$1.2 million</money> in 2015), gaps in reimbursement\nfrom federal and state funding have also increased (from <money>$650,000</money> to\n<money>$750,000</money> in non-RESPTC ETCs). Since 2016, more ETCs reported using their\nunit for routine use when not activated (76% vs. 58%), offsetting\noperational costs.</p>\n\n<p>This study had limitations. ETC responses were self-reported and\nnot validated. The survey tool defaulted nonresponses to zeros;\ntherefore, for reported maintenance costs, averages for cost\nsubcategories might be inflated because zeros were considered\nnonresponses. Since our previous assessment, 22 facilities reported new\nprimary contacts; although we reached out to multiple persons for each\nETC, it is possible personnel from nonresponding facilities have since\nleft their position or hospital. It is also unclear how many\nnonresponding ETCs no longer maintain their capabilities; authors are\naware of several nonresponding hospitals within the network that no\nlonger maintain EVD care capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Since late 2015, the perceived threat of an HHCD outbreak within\nthe borders of <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> has waned, and the perceived demand for\nnumerous US hospitals to maintain a high level of preparedness for HHCDs\nhas dwindled. In tandem with inadequate funding, more ETCs have elected\nto forgo high-level isolation capabilities. The establishment of RESPTCs\nsought to centralize capabilities at a regional level, but many ETCs\nnoted that since 2014, major investments in establishing high-level\nisolation capabilities could prompt continued internal financial support\nif federal funding ceases.</p>\n\n<p>However, ETCs reported heavy reliance on federal funding; nearly\nall reported it as their primary funding stream and leading factor in\nmaintaining capabilities. The 2020 expiration of HPP funds threatens the\nexistence of this network. It is unknown if--and for how long--many ETCs\ncould maintain capabilities solely with internal financial support, or\nif <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States</location> will revert to the level of HHCD preparedness\nbefore 2014. The ongoing EVD outbreak in the <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/zr\">Democratic Republic of the\nCongo</location> and the rise of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LC/cn\">China</location> are\nreminders that HHCD outbreaks are increasingly regular occurrences. The\nhigh proportion of ETCs surveyed that have used their ETC for a person\nunder investigation since 2014 (63%) further underscores the ongoing\nneed of such specialized units across the country. The US healthcare\nsystem has made major strides in HHCD domestic preparedness capability\nsince 2014. However, on the basis of study responses, the US health\nsystem could again be vulnerable and inadequately prepared for the next\nHHCD threat if federal HPP funding is not renewed.</p>\n\n<p><person>Dr. Herstein</person> is Regional Director for Sub-Saharan Africa with the\n<org>Global Center for Health Security</org> at the <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:0728728400\">University of Nebraska Medical\nCenter</org>, <location idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"LU/us.ne.omaha\">Omaha, NE.</location> Her research interests include highly hazardous\ncommunicable diseases, global high-level isolation, infection control,\nand outbreak response and preparedness.</p>\n\n<p>References</p>\n\n<p>(1.) <org idsrc=\"xmltag.org\" value=\"ACORN:1432072899\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</org>.
