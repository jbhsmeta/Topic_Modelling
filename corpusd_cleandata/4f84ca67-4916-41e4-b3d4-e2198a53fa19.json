    "text": "FITCHBURG - The Fitchburg Art Museum has hosted Art in Bloom every spring for\n22 years, and although this year's in-person event was canceled in\nconsideration of the health and safety of the museum's guests, volunteers, and\nstaff, the online floral challenge which was created was a great success.\n\nThis popular event invites local floral designers, garden clubs, and community\nmembers to interpret the art in Fitchburg Art Museum's galleries with flower\narrangements.\n\n\"We are excited to say that the Art in Bloom: An Online Floral Challenge was a\nhuge success,\" Vanessa De Zorzi, museum marketing manager, said. \"It was truly\na community event and a FAM team effort. We received a large number of\ncreative responses covering a wide variety of media from floral arrangements,\nto culinary arts, photography, digital drawing, found object sculpture, and\nmore.\"\n\nThe Fitchburg Art Museum staff had a lot of fun creating and putting together\nArt in Bloom: An Online Floral Challenge.\n\n\"I thought why not make Art in Bloom something people can participate in from\nhome,\" Jessie Olson, the museum's membership and events manager, said. \"People\nmay have flowers blooming in their yards. Or if not, we encouraged people to\nmake flowers materials they can find in their house.\"\n\n\"We chose categories that represented the variety of interpretations and\nmaterials, that would not only celebrate the imagination and creativity, but\nalso the fun of the process,\" Olson said.\n\nWinners of the floral challenge were selected by community jurors including\nTamar Russell Brown of Sitka Creations, David Ginisi of the N.C. Mass. Chamber\nof Commerce, Jessica Clarke local artist and McKay Arts Academy teacher, and\nJulie K. Gray, theartist featured in the Fitchburg Art Museum exhibition After\nSpiritualism: Loss and Transcendence in Contemporary Art.\n\n\"It is important to see how we are still able to bring art into people's\nlives, even when they are unable to walk through our galleries,\" Olson said.\n\"The museum's mission is to be a catalyst for creativity, learning and\ncommunity. This was an opportunity for our community to not only learn about\nthe art in our collection but demonstrate their own creativity in response to\nit.\"\n\nArt in Bloom is held during the month of April at the museum and is\nenthusiastically partnered with the Laurelwood Garden Club and is the museum's\nbusiest weekend of the year, a time when families and friends have a day at\nthe museum.\n\n\"Art in Bloom is our most popular event of the year,\" Olson added. \"We wanted\nour public to still enjoy the idea of art and flowers, even if it was from\nafar.\"\n\nSeveral interpreters expressed appreciation that they were able to still enjoy\nthis event, but also that the chance to make art at home gave them something\npositive and colorful to think about.\n\n\"They had fun,\" Olson said. \"And that is the most important thing to me - that\npeople think of museums and fun together.\"\n\nThe Fitchburg Art Museum is grateful for your support and looks forward to\nwelcoming the community back to their galleries and public spaces. Even in\nthese uncertain times, their mission is to inspire the miracle of art, she\nsaid.\n\nThe online event closed with a champagne reception celebration video.\n\n\"Museum staff, docents and community members joined in a special conversation\nabout this year's Art in Bloom,\" De Zorzi said. \"We discussed how we put the\nevent together, what inspired us, what we enjoyed most, and announced the\nchallenge winners.\n\nThe video premiered on May 15 and is now live on Fitchburg Art Museum's\nwebsite for all to enjoy.\n\n\"The world is changing. I grieve the loss of some things that will never be\nthe same, but I am excited for the challenge of connecting with our audiences\nand members in new ways ~ in some ways - it is more interactive and more\ninventive,\" Olson said. \"By nature, art is a response to the world in which it\nis created. So, it stands to reason that art museums are also responding to\nthe world and community and what they are going through right now. I like that\nit makes us not only relevant, but an antidote to some of the more difficult\nparts of our present.\"\n\nArt in Bloom Winners include:\n\nMost Creative Container: Maxwell Zaleski's interpretation of Douglas\nKornfeld's \"Thurston,\" 2015\n\nBest Use of Nature: Sue Cunio Salem's interpretation of Winslow Homer's\n\"Waiting for a Bite,\" 1874\n\nBest Composition: Cynthia Robinson's interpretation of Winslow Homer's\n\"Waiting for a Bite,\" 1874\n\nMost Illusionistic: Maxwell Zaleski's interpretation of Anne Lilly's \"To Be,\"\n2016\n\nPunniest: Jane Fulton Suri's interpretation of Scott Prior's \"Sunflowers at\nSunrise,\" 2015\n\nBest Use of Found Objects: Victoria Brier's interpretation of Julie K. Gray's\n\"Postmortem: Margaret,\" 2019\n\nMost Inventive Materials: Julie Palioca's interpretation of Jo Sandman's\n\"Serpent 1,\" 2012\u00962014\n\nBest Use of Color: Carolyn Quirk's interpretation of Maria Molteni's \"Bough\nHouse / Bauhaus,\" 2019\u00962020\n\nThe community can get inspired by viewing the artwork of Art in Bloom.

    "html": "<p>FITCHBURG - <org>The Fitchburg Art Museum</org> has hosted Art in Bloom every spring for 22 years, and although this year's in-person event was canceled in consideration of the health and safety of the museum's guests, volunteers, and staff, the online floral challenge which was created was a great success.</p>\n<p>This popular event invites local floral designers, garden clubs, and community members to interpret the art in <org>Fitchburg Art Museum's</org> galleries with flower arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are excited to say that the Art in Bloom: An Online Floral Challenge was a huge success,\" <person>Vanessa De Zorzi</person>, museum marketing manager, said. \"It was truly a community event and a FAM team effort. We received a large number of creative responses covering a wide variety of media from floral arrangements, to culinary arts, photography, digital drawing, found object sculpture, and more.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>The Fitchburg Art Museum</org> staff had a lot of fun creating and putting together Art in Bloom: An Online Floral Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>\"I thought why not make Art in Bloom something people can participate in from home,\" <person>Jessie Olson</person>, the museum's membership and events manager, said. \"People may have flowers blooming in their yards. Or if not, we encouraged people to make flowers materials they can find in their house.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"We chose categories that represented the variety of interpretations and materials, that would not only celebrate the imagination and creativity, but also the fun of the process,\" Olson said.</p>\n\n<p>Winners of the floral challenge were selected by community jurors including <person>Tamar Russell Brown</person> of Sitka Creations, <person>David Ginisi</person> of the N.C. Mass. <org>Chamber of Commerce</org>, <person>Jessica Clarke</person> local artist and <org>McKay Arts Academy</org> teacher, and <person>Julie K. Gray</person>, theartist featured in the <org>Fitchburg Art Museum</org> exhibition After Spiritualism: Loss and Transcendence in Contemporary Art.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is important to see how we are still able to bring art into people's lives, even when they are unable to walk through our galleries,\" Olson said. \"The museum's mission is to be a catalyst for creativity, learning and community. This was an opportunity for our community to not only learn about the art in our collection but demonstrate their own creativity in response to it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Art in Bloom is held during the month of April at the museum and is enthusiastically partnered with the <org>Laurelwood Garden Club</org> and is the museum's busiest weekend of the year, a time when families and friends have a day at the museum.</p>\n\n<p>\"Art in Bloom is our most popular event of the year,\" Olson added. \"We wanted our public to still enjoy the idea of art and flowers, even if it was from afar.\"</p>\n\n<p>Several interpreters expressed appreciation that they were able to still enjoy this event, but also that the chance to make art at home gave them something positive and colorful to think about.</p>\n\n<p>\"They had fun,\" Olson said. \"And that is the most important thing to me - that people think of museums and fun together.\"</p>\n\n<p><org>The Fitchburg Art Museum</org> is grateful for your support and looks forward to welcoming the community back to their galleries and public spaces. Even in these uncertain times, their mission is to inspire the miracle of art, she said.</p>\n\n<p>The online event closed with a champagne reception celebration video.</p>\n\n<p>\"Museum staff, docents and community members joined in a special conversation about this year's Art in Bloom,\" De Zorzi said. \"We discussed how we put the event together, what inspired us, what we enjoyed most, and announced the challenge winners.</p>\n\n<p>The video premiered on <chron>May 15</chron> and is now live on <org>Fitchburg Art Museum's</org> website for all to enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>\"The world is changing. I grieve the loss of some things that will never be the same, but I am excited for the challenge of connecting with our audiences and members in new ways ~ in some ways - it is more interactive and more inventive,\" Olson said. \"By nature, art is a response to the world in which it is created. So, it stands to reason that art museums are also responding to the world and community and what they are going through right now. I like that it makes us not only relevant, but an antidote to some of the more difficult parts of our present.\"</p>\n\n<p>Art in <person>Bloom Winners</person> include:</p>\n\n<p>  Most Creative Container: <person>Maxwell Zaleski's</person> interpretation of <person>Douglas Kornfeld's</person> \"Thurston,\" 2015</p>\n\n<p>  Best Use of Nature: <person>Sue Cunio Salem's</person> interpretation of <person>Winslow Homer's</person> \"Waiting for a Bite,\" 1874</p>\n\n<p>  Best Composition: <person>Cynthia Robinson's</person> interpretation of <person>Winslow Homer's</person> \"Waiting for a Bite,\" 1874</p>\n\n<p>  Most Illusionistic: <person>Maxwell Zaleski's</person> interpretation of <person>Anne Lilly's</person> \"To Be,\" 2016</p>\n\n<p>  Punniest: <person>Jane Fulton Suri's</person> interpretation of <person>Scott Prior's</person> \"Sunflowers at Sunrise,\" 2015</p>\n\n<p>  Best Use of Found Objects: <person>Victoria Brier's</person> interpretation of <person>Julie K.
